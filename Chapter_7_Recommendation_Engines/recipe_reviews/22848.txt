I was young when I submitted this, and totally submitte it wrong. and then I couldnt remember my old login password to change it but finally allrecipes changed it so now its perfect as written. My old review on this used to say "add 1/2 t baking soda" because i had forgotten to include it when i 1st submitted this recipe but once again allrecipes finally made the change so this recipe is now perfect as written. so dont change anything!!! However, Sometimes I do crisco instead of butter. but either way its good.
This has been my favorite recipe since I was 14. Ive tried other ones, but always go back to this one. My friends all love it too, and they only use this recipe. I always underbake my cookies and then freeze them; that way they never get hard.

Congratulations, Ashley!  You've just passed our resident gourment taste tester.  My 24 year old son gave you a 9 1/2 out of ten the first day these were baked and said the remaining 1/2 will be granted when they pass the freshness test in a couple of days.  Well, they did.  The dough is excellent to work with.  I like a dough that I can roll into balls without messy hands.  They stayed high after cooling, were chewy and chokeful of chocolate chips.  I think the problem some had with inconsistency is because the dry ingredients have to be added in gradually as per instructions so that the baking powder will be well-distributed throughout the dough.  After trying tens of recipes this is the one I'll keep.  Thanks, Ashley.

We chose this recipe mainly because it was the only choco chip cookie recipe with only one egg (which we had one of)...used 1 1/2 cups chips and 1/2 cup walnuts chopped the same size as the chocolate... delicious! Our new favorite simple cookie formula!!!

I have been looking for the "perfect" Chocolate Chip recipe for 20 years.  I used the toll house recipe and hated the results.  When I found Ashley's recipe and tried it, I fell in love.  This is how I always wanted my chocolate chip cookies to taste like.  I take them everywhere and make them at least once a week for my family.  My daughters name is Ashley and people ask me for this recipe and I tell them its Ashley's Chocolate chip recipe, they say your daughter and I laugh and say, no, I got the recipe on the net from another terrific Ashley.  Thanks a million!  The cookies are out of this world!!!!!

These are the best cookies in the whole world! I changed the recipe a little (I don't use all the flour or choco chips and I use a little more vanilla than reccomended but oh well) I don't even use the recipe anymore I've made it so many times. Just a hint- don't use all the choco chips

I gave 4 stars only because (per other reviews here) you MUST add ½ teaspoon baking soda to this recipe for the cookies to turn out right.  With this addition, I have found this chocolate chip cookie recipe to be the best I’ve ever made, and people go nuts over them every time I serve them.  I think it’s the 2 full cups of chips that does the trick, and I always use high-quality MILK chocolate chips.  They are slightly more expensive, but it really does make all the difference in the world.  I have wowed so many people with these cookies that I’m asked for the recipe all the time.  I wish I could take the credit for it!

This recipe resulted in the best cookies I've ever made! I even waited a couple of days before reviewing to make sure they stayed good. They did! I did change a little something but not because there was something wrong with the original. I substituted Smart Balance for the butter (equal amounts) and I baked them on a pizza stone. I baked them for 10 mins and left them on the stone for 5 mins before putting them on the rack, like instructed, and they turned out great. It was a little difficult to get them off the stone but they tasted so delicious that I didn't change a thing for the 2nd batch. Best chocolate chip cookie recipe yet!

I made these for the holiday celebration at work and they received rave reviews! I added chocolate covered dried cherries in place of the second cup of chocolate chips, and that gave them a nice touch of chewy tartness.

I've been using this recipe for 7 years and I can honestly say I've never been disappointed and neither have the countless people I've reccomended it too. They stayed soft and tasted great even several days after I baked them. This is the ONLY chocolate chip cookie recipe I use! Thanx for sharing :)

Greatest choc chip cookie recipe ever! Just watch the size of the cookie. I dropped rounded teaspoonful NOT tablespoonful! Cookies were gigantic! Even 3/4 teaspoonful made a good sized cookie. Good luck...you won't be disappointed.

OK, this is my very first time making a chocolate chip cookie from scratch. And it was INCREDIBLE!! My first batch came out perfect. Infact it's been 2 days since i made them and i'm still eating the leftovers. Still taste great 2 days later. The only change i made was using 1 cup milk chocolate chips and 1 cup peanut butter chips :) Will definitely make this one again. Maybe next time with nuts :)

very good recipe and i love the fact that the butter and egg used are low in quantity
only one thing, you need to flatten the cookies with a spatula before you put them in the oven as they do not flatten on their own
this recipe makes just the right amount of cookies, thank you!

I tried this recipe and followed it exactly. After all of the rave reviews I read, I expected to eat the best cookie of my life. Perhaps I set myself up, perhaps this recipe is nothing but a grave dissapinted. They had exquistite aroma, looked like a dream BUT they tasted dry and starchy. I'll stick to my own recipe.

These chocolate chip cookies are great. These cookies do not go flat what so ever. They are perfect... It's just the way I like it. Crispy on the edges and soft on the inside. Has great flavor.

This is the only recipe that I could find that didn't require baking soda, (I was fresh out!)and I wasn't sure it would work...but it did. I used semi sweet chocolate chips and also used margerine instead of butter and they still came out beautiful. These are some of the best chocolate chip cookies that have ever came out of my oven. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe EXACTLY, but the dough is incredibly runny... The cookies are unbelievably flat... And the cookies taste AWFUL! And my ingredients are fine, because I made another CC cookie recipe just the other day. Don't make this recipe! You will be quite unhappy with the results!

Sorry Ashley, but this was not  a good cookie recipe. I have no idea what happened - I followed directions word-to-word, and the batter turned out very crumbly. I had to lower the temperature and keep the cookies in the oven longer, and they stil turned out burned at the edges, and unbaked in the middle. What a waste!

Excellent cookie that's NOT flat like Toll House.  I've been using this recipe for a while and finally decided to review it because it is very reliable.  I adjust the servings to 48 which rounds the ingredients nicely and I still use just one large egg, with 1/4 c. white sugar.  I always use 1 cup of semi-sweet chips with 1 cup of walnuts.  They don't last long!

These are AMAZING!!! The best cookies I have ever made in my life!! They turn out well every time!! I've made them for tons of people and they've all loved them. Currently I'm on a student exchange in France, and when I made these cookies, everyone loved me for it.
The only change I make is that I use semi-sweet chocolate chips, or pieces of dark chocolate, and I only use one cup (or 1-1/3 cup) of chocolate chips since that way you get to eat more of the delicious cookie per bite!!

I was looking for a simple chocolate chip cookie that my 8 yr old cub scout could make mostly by himself and came across this recipe. I am making this my go-to recipe from now on. I didn't have time to let them cool before going on a rack because I only had two pans to alternate and I had to be very careful. I put them on newspaper instead of wire rack so they wouldn't fall apart. Then they seemed a little crispy on the edges while they cooled, but it had gone away after they fully cooled and they were perfect. It has been a few days now and they are still perfect and there aren't many left.

I have been baking for over 30 years and in that time I have been looking for a chocolate chip  cookie with great substance, flavor and texture. This cookie rises nicely and turned out just like the picture above.

This is a GREAT recipe; not too sweet, a light crispy outside with gooey inside.  If you allow it to bake until it is a very light gold on the edges you will get a chewy, gooey cookie with a lightly crispy outside (not crunchy). However, if you want a cookie with a heartier crunch but still want a gooey middle, bake until it is more golden in color, but not brown. One note more: I used unsalted butter so I increased the salt to 1 tsp. I also added 1/3 cp. of quick oats and 1/2 cp. chopped pecans to my recipe. Delicious- I have thrown away my other choc. chip cookie  recipes! :)  Thanks Ashley!

These chocolate chip cookies are the best ever! They have an excellent flavor, do not get flat and even taste good several days later.  I've had several requests for this recipe after bringing them to family gatherings. Thanks for the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made!

Was looking for a new chocolate cookie recipe today and tried this one, all I can say is "It's a Keeper".  The cookies are nice a puffy not flat, hate thin flat cookies.  They are light, and airy and the best I have ever baked.  Can't wait for my husband to come home from work and try them.  Thanks for sharing Ashley, this one is winner for sure.

These were really good!  I have already made them twice.
 The only tweak i made was to put in 3 kinds of chips, 
 (semi-sweet, butterscotch, milk) instead of just milk.  My family loved them!

I'd give this recipe 10 stars for the 1st and 3rd batches I made. I'm finding you can make this recipes the exact same way and sometimes you get flat and "meh" and sometimes you get thick and delicious. Worth the risk of the inconsistency if it hits just right.

I cut out the baking powder and used a full teaspoon of baking soda. I also used equal amounts white and brown sugars as I'm low on both. This turned out really well, though I did chill the dough to keep the cookies from spreading too much. This was a pretty basic chocolate chip cookie, which my husband loves.

Great cookies and extremely easy! I didn't even add the baking soda (as the author later commented) and they still tasted fantastic. Definitely the only chocolate chip cookie recipe I'll be using from now on.

I made these last night for my fiance, who has never had homemade chocolate chip cookies in his life!  I usually use the generic cookie recipe on the back of the chocolate chip bag, but I've just moved to the UK and everything's a little different.  He loved them.  He couldn't stop eating them.  I had to finally take them away when I thought he was going to make himself sick.  I am sitting here, eating one of them as I type this, and they are still good, the next day at noon, still very soft.  My only complaint is that, even after sifting, they flatten out quite a bit.  Next time I will try sifting the flour twice.  No matter what, these are definitely the best cookies I've ever had.  This is my new cookie recipe.

We made these when looking for a softer alternative to recipes with baking soda. I've heard that baking powder makes chocolate chip cookies softer, but after making these with the Ghirardelli chocolate chips we bought I will never go back to the old Toll House recipe! YUM!

I have to agree with some of the reviewers, these cookies are dry. To help them out I added one more egg and 1/4tsp baking soda.  I also greased my cookie sheet.  They came out great with my changes.

Good basic choc chip cookie recipe. A little too "white" for me. I guess I need more brown sugar and a little WW flour. I used 1 cup of chips and it was plenty.

Cookie dough was very hard to work with. Not enough liquid in the batter. Cookies were hard and there were too many chips.

I know there are only so many ingredients and combinations that can make "chocolate chip cookies." So as I re-read the recipe, I can't figure out why these are so great and so perfect. I have tried making great c.c. cookies for years and I think I've finally found my recipe. These are not as cake-like as other reviewers made them sound. They spread out just right on my pan. Delicious, only wish I had doubled the recipe!!

FABULOUS cookies!!! These were nice and thick like chocolate chippers are supposed to be. The only problem was that there weren't enough. Guess I'll have to make them again and again!

I only gave it two stars because the batter was good to eat!  It wasn't thick enough, it did form a peak-not doe like it should be.  The cookies were really flat, thin, and edge browned too fast!  Okay for taste but DO NOT make if you you want them to look nice, like for company!

I just finished making this recipe and the results are great! I hope they still taste good after a few days.

I really don't understand how people are ending up with a runny dough or flat cookies.  The dough was quite thick for me. 

I will use less chocolate chips next time.

I tried out a batch of these cookies yesterday and they are already completely gone! Everyone loved them! I followed the recipe exactly .. it reminded me of a mrs. field's cookie... very soft and chewy - just the way I like it! I had no problems with the recipe & will definitely try them out again. Thank you!

I followed the recipe pretty well, but the cookies do taste a little weird. I don't have a sifter though so I probably just didn't mix the dry ingredients well enough. I made with peanut butter and chocolate chips, and they are pretty good - great texture. I baked them for a little less time though because I noticed after only about 8 minutes that the edges were done. So they're crispy-edged and soft inside. I recommend this to anyone so long as you make sure your dry ingredients are well-blended. Also its nice to be able to roll them by hand with no mess. I flattened them a little with my palm and they're shaped very nice.

Some of the negative reviews scared me a bit. I followed the recipe pretty closely and I'm not sure how anyone could have them turn out poorly. These did NOT last more than 5 minutes in my house. They do not go flat, that is true but I like that. I measured out tablespoon fulls and rolled them into perfect balls to bake. I pressed some batches down a bit before baking but either way (fat or thin) the cookies were cooked perfectly through. My only complaint is that there weren't enough! Does anyone know if the recipe works doubled? Thank you for a wonderful recipe, Ashley.

My husband always complains that my cookies are too "fancy" and he wanted a "plain old chocolate chip cookie" so I tried this recipe.  It worked.  It was easy and simple and they baked up perfectly in 10 minutes.  They aren't anything impressive, but they were good.

This is the first time I've ever made chocolate chip cookies you could eat without soaking in milk!  They were perfect...only lasted 24 hours in my house but great!  I used 1/4 C. crisco and 2/4 C. butter because I was low on butter.  But these were awesome.

Love this recipe! Super easy! I added 1/2 cup of Heath toffee chips just for fun and everyone is freaking out over them.  Thanks!

I use this recipe EVERY time I get a hankering for chocolate chip cookies!  I suppose it helps that I'm a milk chocolate lover! :-)  Thanks again and again, Ashley.  By the way, has anybody tried baking this in a 9" x 13" pan when you're feeling especially lazy?  Just curious as to how they would turn out.  May try it myself next time.

Cheers! Jaylene

This is a great cookie! My only suggestion is to double the recipe. I only got three dozen, very small cookies and I would have preferred to make them bigger but I needed a certain number. I don't think they are dry at all so I'm not sure what that other reviewer did wrong.

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!   I was looking for a new chocolate chip cookie recipe and this is by far my favorite.   I refuse to use shortening in any of my baking and this was one without it.  I used Hershey's special dark chips and I made dough balls and froze them.  I take out 6 or 8 and make just the amount I need whenever  I want them.  I bake them straight out of the freeze..no need to defrost!  Just add a little extra cooking time.  I have a convection oven so I cook them at 350.

Exceptional!  I didn't change amounts of anything, but used dark brown sugar and semi-sweet chips.  I refrigerated half of the dough while I baked the first batch.  I liked the refrigerated dough better because the cookies were thicker when done and didn't spread as much.  I also topped some with whole pecans.  Wonderful recipe, thanks!

OK, I have never posted a review before but I just had to for these cookies - sooooooo good. I have been searching for that perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe, and finally, for me, this is definitely it - my search is over!  These cookies freeze really well and taste like they were fresh, baked out of the oven when you re-heat them from frozen in the toaster oven.  I could eat a whole batch of these but I MUST try to resist!!  Try them, you will love them too:)  Thanks for creating the best chocolate chip cookie recipe ever Ashley.

These cookies are very good. I recommend using a little less than 1/2 a cup of butter and a little less brown sugar. I added 1/2 tbs of cinnamon for flavor and the cookies were very tasty.

These were very tasty tasty and soft. I made them as directed + the 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. I only got 2 dozen cookies though. As I was mixing the chocolate chips I thought 2 cups was way too much but then after it baked it came out great. This will be my go-to recipe.

These are amazing. The brown sugar is the key to the tastiness. It gives it such a wonderful difference to regular chocolate chip cookie recipes. My husband was quite impressed. If you dont want them too cakey, stir with a spoon instead of using a hand mixer. & definitely add in the 1/2 tsp baking soda as recommended by the author. This did not yield 36 cookies for me however, not even close. More like 20-25.

I use this recipe when I want to make a quick batch, and I must say they come out great! I normally don't add the baking powder (because it's hard to find in Spain) but they come out awesome anyway!  This batch doesn't make a lot of cookies, but its good when you have a strong craving for chocolate chip cookies :P

Hooray! These cookies turned out to be the perfect recipe to satiate my pregnancy craving. They turned out crispy and chewy at the same time. I added 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and sifted the flour twice as suggested and they turned out perfect. YUMMY!!!

These cookies are the best I've come across. Mine look nothing like the picture, but every time I've made them, It's been consistent, and they've remained soft. I will only ever use this recipe now.

I've been using this as my go-to chocolate chip recipe for  7 years; it's quick, easy, and tastes great.  I usually sub in dark chocolate chips because I prefer them, but the consistency and sweetness in this recipe is my favorite by far.  It also freezes well if you want to make the dough and then bake it later.

Excellent!!! This is the best cookies I have ever made and it's very easy to make. The only thing is that I find it's a bit too sweet with too many chocolate chips. Perhaps it's because I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate chips.   Anyway, I'll try to make this again but reduce the amt of chocolate chips.

Our family and friends that tried the original version all agreed they were way too sweet. We made them again with these changes: We cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 c. and the white sugar to 1/4 c., We cut the butter down to 1/2 c. We also used only 1/2 c. semi-sweet & 1/2 c. milk chocolate and it was still plenty sweet and chocolaty. Great cookies when made this way!

These were alright. They baked out a little bit flat for my taste, and the texture was a wee bit flaky. I prefer my chocolate chip cookies heartier than that, but that's just me!  When I realized they were coming out a little flat, I crushed about sixteen 'nilla wafer cookies and added the fine crumbs to the dough. They were delicious! Big, puffy, and with an interesting crunch! The vanilla flavor of the crumbs was great paired with the milk chocolate.

Edible...but not great. They taste okay...a bit cakey but the main thing was that they didn't flatten at all! I pressed down the second batch just so the cookie would be bigger!
Oh and definately does not make 3 dozen! I ended up with probably about 2 dozen small cookies.

These were very good. I added 1 tsp. of baking soda because I couldn't remember how much ashley said to add.... I guess it was supposed to be 1/2 a tsp. oops! :) But, they turned out great! Other than that, the only thing I did differently was I only added 1 cup of choco chips. This was just perfect for me and my husband... they were nice and chocolaty... I cannot imagine putting the 2 full cups in... I would say just add one cup first and then if you think it needs more... add more... but I definitely wouldn't add the 2 cups all at once.

I did not like this recipe at all. It seemed like there were way too many chocolate chips... perhaps there isn't enough flour in the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, and the cookies look great, smell great, but do not taste great. No one wants to eat these.

I have a favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe but I thought I'd try another so after looking through the reviews for various recipes on allrecipes.com, I chose this one. I had great hopes for this recipe, given its high ratings by so many people. The dough was quite stiff (unusually so...) and the cookies never spread out during baking (even though I followed directions exactly) and the cookies ended up rounded and like hockey pucks. I'm not sure what happened but I will not be making these again.

I was looking for a good recipe that used milk chocolate chips, and this is it! After reading the reviews, and since I don't like cak-ey cookies, I left out the baking powder. I also accidentally left out the baking soda (oops!), but they were delish and I'm not sure it would have been a big improvement. I followed someone else's advice and took them out when the edges had a little color-- about 10 minutes for me. Slightly crispy edges, soft centers, just like I like 'em! Yum.

OH MY GOODNESS!!! This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever tried. I like my cookies puffy and cakey... which is exactly what these are. I didn't try the recipe without the baking soda, but after reading reviews, I added it to my first-shot recipe, which was a good decision. Great cookies... WONDERFUL! WONDERFUL! WONDERFUL!

These cookies were way too cakelike for my taste. I added that extra 1/2 tsp of baking soda, but I didn't like eating them. They taste OK but the texture is like eating a crunchy cake.

I was nervous because of some of the reviews but these were great. Its a light, buttery cookie. 

People who had problems my guess is that you didn't slowly add in the dry ingredients. Its key with making any dough. I added the dry ingredients by the 1/4 cup and mixed by hand - which I think is key. If you use an electric mixer only use it to cream the sugar and butter then do everything else by hand. 

These came out beautifully. Perfectly brown and golden brown around the edges. Thanks for sharing this with us Ashley!

I definitely reccomend more flour in this recipe. They were very thin when i took them out of the oven and fell apart. But they were some of the most delicious cookies ever! (When you make these, be sure to spread them WAY apart or else you'll end up with a cookie pie!!)

i substituted all the fat for unsweetened applesauce, and mine came out very fluffy and almost like dense cakes... very good healthier alternative. im just stingy with stars.

Really good basic chocolate chip cookies. I personally used soy margerine and froze the chips in advance so they would keep their shape when they baked (and that I wouldn't snack on them before I got a chance to bake with them).

I didn't have much luck with this recipe... the dough was runny and the cookies turned out flat.  HOWEVER, I cant 100% blame it on the recipe as we always use egg replacer since my son is allergic to eggs.  usually works perfectly but apparently not with this one... Taste was decent tho.

I've used this recipe about 6 times and 4 out of the 6 times the cookies burnt in the oven within 5 minutes of baking and didn't flatten out at all. Twice it worked perfectly and they were really good. I don't understand what's so sensitive in the recipe that this would happen. It's not my oven either because i tried it at my mom's and the same thing happened. I wouldn't recommend this recipe if you're short on ingredients because you might end up with nothing. When it works the cookies are great though.

I made half the original recipe, and they were so good I should have made the entire thing! They were definitely a huge hit with the students in my class. I would recommend to err on the side of undercooking - mine were a bit gooey on the inside and people said they were perfect.

I made these with one of my friends at school and they turned out really well. Some of the guys in our squadron even offered to pay us to make them a batch! We used one cup of chocolate chips and one cup of skor bits instead of two cups of chocolate chips.

I will end all of this controversy over these cookies right now.  These are the best cookies I have ever eaten in my life and I have tried almost every other recipe on this site.  Everyone that tastes these immediately wants the recipe. You do have to follow the directions exactly but the result will be heaven

I have such a hard time with chocolate chip cookies, but this recipe was the best ever! I had to cook them a bit longer than was instructed, but otherwise, they were gone in a matter of hours! Literally! They are awesome all will definitely use this as my standard chocolate chip cookie recipe!

These chocolate chip cookies are yummy. If anyone doesn't like they must not be following the recipe because they taste great. My boyfriend said they are the best chocolate chip cookies he has ever eaten.

Very good, I followed the recipe exactly this time and they turned out great. Next time I'm going to omit the salt. Make sure to roll them into perfect balls and flatten them, they don't spread as they bake.

These cookies were delicious! My family loves chocolate chip cookies and they said these were one of the best ones.  I did add peanut butter chips along with the chocolate chips.  I highly recommend these.

I KEEP coming back to this recipe! I was looking for a good recipe I could easily convert while in Europe for grad school and every one of my international friends absolutely LOVED these "American cookies". They were in high demand from Greek to Malaysian to British to Asian friends.  The only thing I changed was to include bittersweet chocolate chunks with the milk chocolate chips.  Delicious and divine!  Thanks Ashley!

These cookies are good. They remind me of something my grandmother would make. They have a very nostalgic, almost preschool taste, and that's what makes these comforting. The healthy amount of salt adds a nice balance to the sugar. I like that this recipe is smaller. I'm definitely adding this to the chocolate chip recipe cabinet.

Excellent recipe.  Ive been using the same chocolate chip recipe for about 20 yrs and thought it was time for a change.  The only thing I changed was I used half butter and half butter-flavored shortening.  I kept everything else the same.  This is a keeper!

Really good recipe. It had less butter than others I was looking at, so I liked that. Only reason I docked a star is because they flattened out a little more than I would have liked. I am no baker, so I don't have any idea what to do to get them to stay more "fluffy". Really good flavor though. I especially like that they are good ole chocolate chip cookies and not trying to be all fancy or "daring" (eye rolling). I may make them again.

These are so much better than Toll House.  They are not overly sweet, but are just right.  Sometimes I use black walnuts in the recipe which makes the cookies even yummier!

Easy and delicious. I added some broken walnuts to some of them, and that was great too.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. My cookies had a great taste but were not chewy enough. I think the reason for this was because the cookies were left in the oven too long. On the recipe, it said 8-10 minutes, so I left them in for nine and they were almost burnt. Next time I would only leave them in for 7-8 minutes.

I discovered this recipe quite by accident when I needed a batch of cookies quickly and realized I only had one egg left. So googled "cookie recipes with one egg" and voila! Discovered my new favorite! Soft, chewy, easy! I've now also made a batch with M&Ms instead of chocolate chips...also a keeper.

The cookies were delicious! My batch made 45 of them and I baked them in batches of 15 for 10 minuets. The reason I didn't rate them 5-stars was because of the chocolate chips. The recipe called for 2 cups, but that was way too much. Instead, I only used 1 cup and they were perfect.

This was a good chocolate chip cookie.  I would have used less butter, maybe 1 stick would be fine .  Other than that it was tasty.  I eyeballed the choc chips and added cararmel chips too.

I made it with salted caramel chips instead of regular chocolate chips. I ended up making a batch for my friend, my teacher, a girl moving into the ward, and my family. My brother said to make it again. As it was amazing.

The first time I made these as written with the addition of 1/2 C chopped walnuts and they were delicious! They had a very buttery flavor and were flat and chewy. Since I am always seeking a fat chocolate chip cookie that is crispy outside and chewy inside, I made these again adding the walnuts, reducing butter to 1/2 C and baking at 350 rather than  375 for the same amount of time. The dough was crumbly and had to be pressed together/rolled once scooped with a small cookie /ice cream scoop. However, they turned out exactly as I had hoped: FAT, CRISPY OUTSIDE, CHEWY INSIDE and FULL OF FLAVOR!

I liked them. My son didn't. Like another reviewer said her husband didn't like them because they tasted too "cakey", that was the same feedback my son had. Like  said I liked them and they are super easy to make.

I never have felt compelled to write a review-- until I made this recipe.  Hands down, the BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe EVER.  Stop looking, folks.  This one is the best. Made a little over 3 dozen 2-3" cookies.  Probably will double recipe next time because these cookies went fast.

11/24/17 - I was bored and thought it would be nice to bake something, and I'm very young and not too experienced in baking so I wasn't sure if these would turn out the best if I did something wrong, but 1. I followed instructions carefully and did it right and 2. these were amazing!! My family loved them. I gave one to my mom and she was immediately obsessed. My nanny said they were really good and so did my dad and one of my sisters. Normally my mom finishes surgery sweets in a sort of long period of time because she doesn't have a big sweet tooth, but she finished the cookie I gave her in about 30 seconds, and I'm serious. Next time I make them I might reduce the sugar a little because they were a little bit sweet, but they were still amazing. I will 100% consider making these again! edit: 12/24/17 - a few days ago I made these for the 3rd time, and they're still amazing. My family ate them up before the next morning. And I made them at about 7:30 at night. Lmao. I reduced the brown sugar and used a little bit less butter because I was low on butter at the time, and the batch was a lot smaller and I only made 12, and my sister that is gluten free AND dairy free ended up eating 5 and her stomach was aching, but they were just that good she ignored her diet. Lol. Without as much butter it was more clumpy and not stuck together and that worried me, but it still clumped together well to put on the cookie sheets. Next time I'll follow the normal recipe again so it's easier to m

Okay, so at first I didn't think these were good cookies - I thought they had too much flour in them and it was too hard to mix together with my hand mixer.  My family loved the taste, so I was determined to try the recipe again.  I kept everything the same except I mixed the dough in my stand mixer the 2nd time and I can't believe the difference in how the cookies baked up!  Instead of seeming too flour-y, they looked like the perfect chocolate chip cookie and the taste matches!  I also appreciate that this recipe calls for milk chocolate chips - I thought we were the only family who would sub milk chocolate for the semi-sweet chips :)  Great recipe - now my go-to chocolate chip recipe, thank you!

I have searched high and low for the perfect chocolate chip cookie and this is it! The only thing I did a little different is use a little butter flavored Crisco along with the butter to make up my 3/4 cup. Delish!

I will probably make this recipe again, but there was way too many chocolate chips in each cookie.  I didn't even add the amount given.  I used a cup and a half and still my mouth was coated in chocolate.

Outstanding chocolate chip cookies recipe and I've made a few!  I did change the extract -- using an OliveNation emulsion called Princess Cake which is Vanilla, Almond and Lemon and is so very yummy.  Be sure you cream your butter and sugars with a mixer, sift your dry ingredients in gradually and use ALL the chocolate chips called for.  I baked for 12 minutes and doubled the recipe.  These cookies maintained their shape and were simply delicious!

Due to some miscommunication they didn't get left on the pan for the five minutes, and they were slightly larger than Tbls, but they were very popular, and quite delicious!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I both agreed it will be the recipe I make from now on. I've always made the Crisco recipe but the flavor of the pecans is enhanced some how with this recipe. Definitely our new favorite!

Delicious! I used guittard chips and the stand mixer made the dough very light and fluffy. I had to cook them a little longer but took them out of the oven as soon as they started to brown.

I have the allrecipes favorite cookie book and this one is in it. It says a lot about the recipe when half a dozen cookies are gone before all the cookies are finished baking. Dangerously good recipe. And I omitted the baking soda, it wasn't in the cookbook version. Thanks Ashley! I have found my perfect chocolate chip recipe!

Used this recipe to get rid of some leftover Halloween candy. Froze and smashed up a bunch of random candy (mostly snickers) instead of chocolate chips. Also, used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening instead of all butter (personal preference) and they turned out great!!

I'm so thrilled to find a chocolate chip cookie recipe that I will keep! I recently made the Tollhouse recipe but this one has it beat by a longshot! If you're wanting a cookie that doesn't turnout flat once baked, this is the one for you.

This recipe was excellent. I do not have a sifter so I just used a whisk to "sift" the dry ingredients by mixing with it with a  (whisk). My eleven year old daughter likes to "take over" when we bake together, so I was glad this was a fool proof recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as written, although my softened butter was partially melted. I am not even a big fan of chocolate chip cookies and these were SUPERB!! One added note: I used Nestle Toll House semi-sweet chocolate chips. It gave the cookies a very decadent flavor!! Delish..

I love this recipe! It's absolutely delicious, and I've made it twice now. I used dark brown sugar, purely because that's what I had, and followed everything else. The cookies are gone as soon as they're out of the oven, which is why I can't make them often. ;) Still, this is my favorite recipe for cc cookies, and I've tried at least twenty and this is the only that works. Thank you for posting this, and enriching my life.

Good flavor, I did add extra brown sugar, vanilla, and some cinnamon.  Very good and I liked the consistency of the dough.  It didn't spread out a lot when cooking.

This recipe was AWESOME!!

I only did three things differently:
1. Refridgerated the dough for 10 minutes prior to rolling.
2. Pressed the chocolate chips into the rolled and flattened cookie dough just prior to baking.
3. Used castor sugar, as regular white sugar melts and leaves little holes where the sugar granule was.

But I loved this recipe and shared it on my Facebook page which is www.facebook.com/shared.recipes.australia

Thanks Ashley for sharing!

I thought the taste was good.  The amount of flour seemed reasonable, but I found them extremely hard to stir--very thick.  They were chewy but flat, didn't look like the cookie on the picture.  Baked for 8 min.  The only thing I did differently was to refrigerate the dough to make later.  I let it sit out for awhile before making.  It was really hard.  Don't want to rate them ,as most people really liked them.  However, I probably won't make them again.

I only used this because all I had was one egg and I had no brown sugar so I just used white instead. I was pleased with the results. I didn't get to try much of it due to the fact everyone else in the house devoured them!

Recipe is great :) Read all reviews/took pains to sift/avoid adding too much flour. They came out fantastic. I really liked the way they stayed soft so long. Often it's difficult for me to get homemade cookies to turn out soft/chewy without winding up under baked. In past when I've succeeded no matter how I wrapped them up in just a day or two they were dry and hard - yuck already. So I tried that toss in an apple trick - don't do it! My wonderful cookies took on a horrible odd apple taste and stunk like refrigerated apples too :( Well this recipe solves everything. Pros - need only one egg, turn out cake like and soft not thin and bendy and raw, just toss in a Ziplock bag and they will stay nice and soft for longer than you are able to keep them in the house. Makes a substantial and satisfying cookie. Real crowd pleaser. Great for gift giving. Cons - probably a bummer of a recipe for people with hardening of the arteries/prone to stenosis due to all the butter that's in there and two, have to forget about suggested times and just watch these cookies like a hawk till they look right because they are very prone to burning. Also it can be tricky because the centers will be all raw and doughy and puffy and look like they still need five minutes (or more) longer when actually, towards the end they will go from that stage to ready in seconds. Err on side of caution. You can always pop them back in the oven and bake a little longer if needed - it's a very forgiving dough.

The best chocolate chip cookies from scratch I've ever made. Still soft after a day, I only know from one day because they were gone before 2 days. I  actually added white chocolate chips and used semi sweet chocolate chips. Awesome recipe Ashley!

Amazing cookies!  I was looking for a recipe that would showcase some excellent milk chocolate chips I had.  This one did the trick.  The cookie flavor complemented the milk chocolate very well.

I like these. The texture is great, especially if you stay within the under-baked time frame. Soft and chewy. They don't get crispy/brown on the edge or top, only a little on the bottom, which is what I like. they won't look done at all when you pull them out but once cool they flatten down a little. I do think these are too sweet; I will definitely add more salt next time (or less sugar) and see if that helps. I used semi-sweet chips too, it would have been even sweeter with the milk chocolate chips! If you're looking for a very sweet and soft chewy cookie, this is the one! Also I thought they were terrible when I ate one in the first 20 minutes or so of pulling them out of the oven - they DEFINITELY taste better when cooled fully. They just taste like grease and sugar when warm. I was about to give them a bad review but then I tried another - glad I did!

I used this recipe because I only had 1 stick of butter and my family really wanted chocolate chip cookies.  I used the one stick or butter and 1/3 cup of tub whipped butter and the turned out great!  Crispy on the outside and chewy middles.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Really nice and chewy, but a little sweet. I'll probably put 1/2 cup brown sugar next time. this is definitely not dry - just don't forget to add in the 1/4 tsp baking soda, like Ashley mentioned in the comments.

These cookies were awesome! Some of the best I've ever had. Very rich and buttery. I found that the cooking temp/time didn't work for my oven, but they baked perfectly at 325 for 10 minutes.

I've never met a chocolate chip cookie I didn't like and this was no exception! So good! Instead of chocolate chips, I used chocolate chunks. YUM and thank you!!

This recipe is perfect!  I am in Mexico City, and I was trying to make cookies with many obstacles.  I followed this recipe the best could, considering I don't have measuring cups or spoons, and I'm dealing with baking at an altitude of around 7200 ft.  My cookies were amazing!  The only change I made was using semi-sweet chips, instead of milk chocolate.

AAAAAhhhmazing! My daughter attributes it to the various kinds of chips we used I really liked the plain dough too though. I geuss we'll never know:). As I said I added all different kinds of chocolate: white chocolate chips, mini milk chocolate chips, and someleftover chocolate bars. I used it to kind of clean out my pantry. It worked VERY well. It was moist and I don't know what people are saying it's a dry dough. It was great fresh out of the oven steaming and hot:)

I'm not sure if it was just my oven or what, but the first batch turned pretty crunchy on the outside of the cookie with it just being cooked 8 minutes. I like my cookies chewy and soft, so I turned my oven down a little bit and this helped alot. They were pretty good but not my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe.

I am sorry but this recipe just doesn't quite work. As another reviewer said, the cookies are quite dry. I followed the recipe exactly and used a non-stick cookie sheet. The cookies burnt around the edges and stuck to the pan. The pan should be greased! The taste of the cookies was good but DRY. There is not enough butter in this recipe.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever used!  It is quick, easy, and the dough is pleasant to work with.  I use a whole package of semi-sweet chocolate chips, mini M&Ms, and mostly recently I also added a package of white chocolate chips-- they go very quick and the recipe is always requested.  Thank you!!

Thanks Ashley!  I used semi-sweet instead of milk chocolate chips but everything else I followed to a T.  They look good and taste even better!  I had to quick package them up so I wouldn't eat them all!

Really great! A little too salty but that was my fault because I added salted butter (I think)a long with the salt... I pretty much followed the recipe but halved the chocolate (semi-sweet). Cook them for the length it says. :)

Really good. I had to use 1/2 c butter and 1/4 c. canola oil, mixed an egg and vanilla in, then added the other dry ingredients, ending with the flour and 1 c. peanut butter chips and 1 c. semi-sweet chocolate. I'm a one bowl gal-really, I think this is the best. soft and chewy! I'll add pecan chips next time.

by far the best cookies i've ever made! i made 80 of them for my father's work (i'm only 16) they were so easy to make and they tasted delicious and were so soft. i added crushed up pieces of butterfingers, and toffee, and chocolate chunks instead of chips and came out wonderful. i'm going to try m&m's next time. the recipe was perfect i didn't have to alter anything. definitely will be making again =).

These were great! I didn't have enough butter so I used 1/4 cup of shortening with the 1/2 cup of butter and they turned out beautifully! If you leave them in balls they don't flatten alot so they end up big and soft! I did one batch like that, and one batch slightly flattened. KEEPER!!

This recipe really works for me!  First, it is easy and fast!  Of course, I had to do some tinkering... I changed the servings to 48 so that I would use 2 sticks of butter (ocd thing I guess...:).  This made it so that it asks for 1 1/3 egg, but I put 2 in.  Also, it then asks for 2 2/3 c chips, but a bag is 2 c, so I put a whole bag and then 2/3 c finely-ish chopped walnuts.  At this point I ask myself if I should just use the original quantity and forget about the not-even-butter-stick thing...:)  But, these cookies turn out great, they are light and fluffy, and a little cake-like, the way that I like them.  Whenever I follow the Toll House recipe, they always come out flat as a pancake and borderline overcooked.  I love these, and they got great reviews from all of the people that tried them!

The cookie dough part of the cookie was pretty good.  BUT, this cookie really needed semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The milk chocolate flavor just blended in with the cookie. I  added 1/3 cup of peanut butter also.  Next time I will use the same recipe but swap the chips.

These are one of the best cookies I've tasted, and they cook really well too. I love it that they actually didn't come out flat. They are nice & fluffy. I didn't add as many chocolate chips as called for because I don't like too much chocolate in mine and I added some chopped walnuts. Wow, they're great!! Some reviewers said that they are too sweet-- NOT SO. I don't like cookies that are very sweet and these are perfect!

This recipe is perfect!  I am a chocolate chip cookie snob, and I think everything about this recipe is great!  The only change I made was to add semi-sweet chocolate chips (and one batch with M&Ms as well), but that is just a taste preference!  When they came out of the oven my 11 year old said "wow!  I like these cookies, they're perfect!" :-) Thanks Ashley!

These are alright. I'm still in search of a go-to CCC recipe that never fails. This one, for me, has too too much brown sugar. It just made the chocolate taste odd or something. I am absolutely going to try again, because I love when young cooks have great recipes, but I might work on the quantity of brown sugar a tad...or use something in place of chocolate chips. Hmmm. Thanks Ashley!

These are so easy to make and yummy! I give only four stars because they taste very buttery, but I suppose that's a good thing.  A very sweet cookie also.  Would be good with a mix of different chips.

I measured precisely and followed the directions as told, and I'm not a fan of this cookie.  Half the joy of making choc. chip cookies is eating the dough but this dough tasted bitter, probably because of the Baking Powder and Baking Soda and 1/2 tsp.(!) of Salt.   The baked cookie was no better and was not soft and chewy but hard like a hockey puck and I had to bake them 12 minutes just to get any browning (yes, my oven is calibrated correctly). I bake cookies by custom order for my clients and just happy I did not try these out on one of them.  But use I can see for these is to now break them up into bits to sprinkle onto a frosted cake or perhaps to stir them in to vanilla ice cream like cookie dough ice cream.  I am going back to (almost like) Mrs. Fields's chocolate chip cookie recipe for my cookie clients.

Mine turned out very much like the original toll house cookies.  They flatted out nicely, and weren't cakey at all.  I followed the recipe as written (using 1/2 teaspoon baking soda + 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.  Husband loved them! Thanks Ashley!

They are really great.  They are on the sweet side for chocolate chip cookies, so if that's a problem I would use semi-sweet chips instead.  Great recipe though!

I added chopped pecans to my batch and made an already great cookie even better! The recipe says it yeilds 36 cookies, but I ended up with 27.. I used a larger sized spoon.. they came out lightly crisp on the very edges and nice and chewy in the middle. Thumbs up here! :o)

I tried this recipe and the cookies were hard as a rock. no matter how soft there were and how little cooking time used, did help. they were stil hard as a rock. Using two types of sugar charged the taste. The dough was chakly. This recipe isn't for adults, maybe kids as the dough seemed like a dough a kid would produce not and adult.  Not good for parties or guest.

Didn't use baking powder but they turned out fine. I also had to cook them for about 12 minutes. I  added walnuts and used less chocolate chips. Nice and chewy inside and crispy outside. Yum

These are the absolute BEST chocolate chip cookies I have ever eaten! Don't forget to add the 1/2 tsp baking soda she added later. My whole family agrees this is the ONLY chocolate chip cookie recipe we will ever need!!! Thank you sooooooooo much, Ashley!

This one's a keeper! I have a chocolate chip cookie recipe that I love, but it requires refrigeration before baking or else the cookies come out flat. I've been hunting for a different recipe that produces similar results without refrigeration -- a chunky, soft cookie that's not too sweet. This recipe delivered! I used semisweet chips. The cookies are delicious! I did add the 1/2 tsp baking soda that the author made a note about. This recipe made 2 1/2 dozen cookies using a size 40 cookie scoop. I baked them on Silpat for about 11 or 12 minutes. Once the edges start just to get color, they're done. The tops will still look pale; if the tops get color, they won't be as soft and will probably end up crunchy.

I work in an office of all men and for each of their birthdays I bake a "treat" of their choice.  One of the guys requested Chocolate Chip cookies and I usually make Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookies so I came to Allrecipes to find a "regular" recipe to try.  My immediate criteria was one that would use the ingredients I had in the house.  After reviewing several recipies I decided to use this one and I am so glad I did.  The cookies were easy and turned out awesome!!  All of the guys told me to hang on to this recipe.  I did have to make a couple of modifications due to lack of ingredients: 1) I used half milk chocolate chips & half semi-sweet chocolate chips and 2) I only had 2 sticks of butter, so I used 1/2 cup of Crisco to make up the difference (I doubled the recipe).  I also took the advice of another reviewer and added the dry ingredients a little at a time, however, since I was too lazy to do it by hand I kept my Kitchenaid mixer on the lowest setting and it worked perfectly! These cookies are so good - chewy & chocolatey!!  Ashley - thanks for the great recipe!

I just tasted one of these cookies from the oven. Very good, I was surprised by the differant reviews. I had no problem with the dough. I did cream it all by hand to make sure though. Just make sure you add the flour mixture a little at a time. The cookies were not flat either, they were really good. I needed a milk chocolate, cashew cookie recipe so I decided on this one and glad I did. It is a differant taste, but a good one. Thanks

Nothing spectacular, but they do stay nice and soft. Kind of an average chocolate chip cookie recipe, I would say. I was surprised of the consistency of the dough - it actually forms peaks after beating like frosting. I made this because they were a little bit healthier than some other chocolate chip cookie recipes, so for being healthy they were pretty good!

Awesome... some of the  other reviews made me skeptical but I didn't have baking soda so this was the best recipe for me.  The cookies came out wonderfully; crispy edges and gooey insides.  I think these cookies would be best for those who prefer the softer chewier cookie although these cookies could satisfy just about anyone! Thanks!

I made these last night, and they were delicious.  I added some cocoa, and used mint chocolate chips... mmm.  Highly recommended.  The dough was very stiff and dry when I was mixing it all together; I actually had to knead it with my hands, but I resisted the temptation to add more liquid and they came out great.

We might have gone wrong somewhere with this recipe! We only managed to bake 12 cookies and they tasted really sweet and were really thin and crumbly. We'll try again soon though and see if we can get it right this time!

Very good cookie.  Because my husband insisted, I used half milk chocolate chips and half semi-sweet.  Tasted good but very similar to Toll House.  Next time, I will try the recipe exactly as stated.  I found I had to bake the cookies about 2 mins. longer than the time stated.

Not bad, kind of bland.  Usually chocolate chip cookies are devoured in my house, and I think there are only 3 or 4 missing.  Won't be making these again.  Sorry

These were not at all what I was looking for, they didn't flatten AT ALL they just stayed in one big lump.  They also tasted very pastey and bland.  Good Luck with this one.

I have been using this recipe to make chocolate chip cookies for years and years! We make a batch, roll the dough into balls and put them in the fridge so that we can make small batches daily in the toaster/convection oven. Yummy way to enjoy fresh cookies without heating up the house.

These were ok. They were really flat but tasted pretty good. Then again, some people like flat cookies, just not me. I really don't think I'll be making these again.

Thank you for creating and sharing such a wonderful recipe Ashley!!  The cookies were exactly what I was hoping for, chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. For a flatter cookie, press dough with palm of hand before baking.  I was careful to measure ingredients exactly, and was happy with the results!!  Thanks again Ashley!!

Ashley, you are my hero! This is the first cookie recipe I made that people actually enjoyed. They stayed soft even overnight, and weren't around long after. I wouldn't change a thing! Thanks!

I used semisweet chips instead of milk chocolate, & i had to bake them at 200 degrees celsius at 10 minutes instead of the recommended time & temperature, but other than that, the cookies taste wonderful!  It'll definitely appeal more to people who like their cookies chewy.

What yummy cookies! My friend and I (at age 15) made them together and they always turn out great...nice and soft...delicious :D they disappear very quickly between the two of us!
