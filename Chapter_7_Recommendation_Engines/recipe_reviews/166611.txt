Awesome recipe, Alex! I just happened to have a banana and an avacado that needed to get used so I whipped this up and yum! Subbed honey for the agave and added a little vanilla but that's it. I will be making this again for sure.   Have been making this about twice a week and have found that adding a tablespoon or 2 of peanut butter makes it like a PB cup pudding. Yum! *******UPDATE***** I added a little extra soy milk and ran it through my ice cream machine with great results. Kind of like a Frosty but nicer. Also makes killer pudding pops. Sometimes I add granola to the pudding for breakfast, too. I love this recipe.
*new update*
Didn't have a banana so I used just the avocado, honey, some nestle's quick (it's what I had), and milk. Better than anything out of a plastic cup. Yum. Next time I'm adding some malt. Thanks, Alex. This is one of the best recipes ever.

Update 1/19/12 -- i have been making this fir such a long time and i have my own variation now thta i thinks beats the original. Use one large very ripe avocado, and one barely ripe banana. Note the distinction! Omit the coconut completely. Substitute 1/4 c honey for the agave. Substitute 1 cup vanilla coconut milk for the soy milk. Add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. You wont be sorry!!!!

5 stars for the sheer genius of this recipe! It's healthy and tasty - a true guilt free dessert. A couple things to mention - this is best served very cold. Otherwise the avocado taste comes through a little. Also, if you don't like banana, you may not care for this. The banana flavor is unmistakable. In fact this really should be called chocolate-banana pudding. But really, there are no complaints from me. I liked my bowl clean :)

OUTSTANDING! My kids never knew the difference and we were astounded at how yummy it was... Very surprising, excellent.  A word to the wise:  DO NOT TRY TO SUBSTITUTE OTHER INGREDIENTS. The only people to give lousy reviews are those without the proper ingredients - substitutions with 'raw food' recipes usually don't work as well, so please try it with what it calls for - especially the raw cocoa - this is NOT the cocoa you get from hershey's which is bitter and WILL RUIN this delicious recipe... Rice milk or other nut milk can be safely substituted - but not dairy - defeats the point of raw anyhow... =)  Enjoy, loved it and will be making it many, many more times... =D

I loved this recipe!  However, I changed a few things to make it my own. I don't use soy milk so I didn't use that.  I had a young thai coconut so I cracked that open and poured the water off then I scraped the coconut meat out.  I used the coconut meat, avocados, organic unsweetened coconut flakes, Carob powder, agave nector for sweetener and a dash of organic vanilla extract.  I am licking the bowl as I speak....Wonderful!

All right...clearly tastes like a health food.  i used honey and skim milk and added vanilla extract to make it a little more desert-y.  good for breakfast though.

I got this recipe through the "Daily Dish" email. I read it and realised that I had pretty much everything on hand, so curiousity got the better of me and I gave it a try. I struggled with how to rate this recipe because I'm not a vegan or a complete naturalist I had to do some substituting, which I hate doing when trying a recipe for the first time. I don't even know what agave nectar is so I used honey like others suggested. I used 1% milk since that's what was in my fridge. I also only had sweetened coconut to work with and I assume that raw cocoa powder and Hershey or Fry's cocoa powder is the same thing. The texture was perfect. Nobody will ever mistake the flavour for Jello Chocolate pudding, but it was pleasant. Not too sweet, but it definitely qualifies to fill a sweet craving. My 2 yr old thought it was the bee's knees. I suppose I could try making this with chocolate milk or adding more honey or more banana... But in the grand scheme of things this recipe acomplishes what it was set out to do, be a healthier alternative.

Wow! Anyone who comes across this recipe must try it, it's so unusually flavorful! I love it, and would have never thought of adding an avocado in this recipe. My husband says it tastes like Spring. I used rice milk instead of soy milk, and I only used a little under 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder and that seemed to be more than enough (keep in mind I've been eating healthy for almost half a year). Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is awesome! I think it is funny that some people thought it tasted to healthy and not like the store bought kind.  It is made from avocado and banana of coarse they will not taste the same. :)My kids and I LOVED it.  I put in a couple scoops of almond butter and didn't add the coconut because I had none. I also added honey instead of the agave.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I will be making this for my kids lunch and mine too!!!

This was excellent! It was slightly thinner than expected, but my friends and I nearly licked our bowls, if THAT says anything! I used coconut milk because I hate the taste of soy (and soy is bad for you, plus I figured it would be a bit thicker. While I love banana, I wonder if one could tone down the banana flavor by using a still-green banana. I think I'm going to try it with 2 avocados and 1/2 banana to make it a little thicker and a little less banana-y.

This was truly AMAZING.  Don't get hung up on the avocado.  For heaven sake, I confidently used 2 avocados to get a thicker consistency!  I used local honey instead of agave, homemade almond milk and carob powder.  Still, the BOMB-DIGGITY!  TRY IT!

Excellent! It tasted so good out of the blender, I couldn't wait a full hour to chill it, but I managed to have enough self-control to stick it in the freezer for 15 minutes. What a delicious, easy dessert. We all loved it! For those who have complained, I would recommend using an avocado and banana that are at peak ripeness for raw eating - no black spots.

This is very good.  I used a frozen banana and a small avocado.  Did not have agave nectar so used what was on hand:  honey.  Also, only had vanilla soy milk, so used that as well.  Lastly, only had sweetened coconut flakes.  Regardless, this recipe was excellent.  You would never know it was made with an avocado but there is a definite banana taste.  Also, had some almond milk on hand and used 1/4 cup.

Yum!  Don't knock it until you try it!  I was out of agave nectar, so I used raw honey instead.  I also added more than the recipe stated (I like my chocolate extra sweet)  I added a few raw almonds, and this turned into the perfect, guilt free desert!

Love this.  I use So Delicious carton coconut milk instead of soy milk since that's what I keep around.  I make this about once a week and use it for snacking.

I had the recipe a while before I tried it.  I had other things I wanted to do with my avocados.  Today I needed a quick treat after the dentist and whipped this up.  I used unsweetened coconut milk and honey.  I think it could be a little sweeter, but my 2 yr old LOVED it.  I did find myself licking the blender.  Must be something about this recipe.

All I can say is wow! Super good, satisfies the sweet tooth, and it makes me happy that it is so healthful!  I am using this for my son's first birthday.  I am definitely impressed!  This recipe had me licking the blender.  Don't worry folks, it wasn't plugged in!

We were very reserved about trying this one, because who would ever think about avacado and banana in the same dish.  It turned out great!!  We used light coconut milk instead of the soy since soy is not Dr. Axe approved.  This truely made it no-guilt!

I thought this was good, family told me it tasted 'weird'.  It doesn't really pass for 'normal' chocolate pudding, but it is a great substitute for something sweet and chocolatey without the guilt.

I am the original submitter of this recipe and am so pleased with how many people have enjoyed this.  Thanks for the feedback (good or bad)!!!   I finally got to try this on some other family members when they came to stay with us for a few days.  They were all looking at me like I was crazy, but everyone tried it.  Three out of four were really impressed and two asked for seconds.  My younger brother said it tasted too much like the cocao. Oh well, you can't please them all! :)  Based on one of the other reviewers, I made frozen chocolate pops with the pudding by simply pooring the mixture into ice cube trays and sticking a toothpick in each cube.  It was a stifling 108 degrees outside today here in the Arizona desert and these little treats certainly made it easier to get through the hot afternoon!

I dislike avocados so was thrilled you can't taste it in this. It tastes just like chocolate banana pudding. I wonder what kind of flavorings could enhance it (rum? vanilla?). (Note: I didn't add coconut.)

This is a five star recipe with just a few small additions.  It may sound weird, but just try it.
Add: 1 teaspoon of good balsamic vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon of Braggs amino acids (or coconut aminos) and 1/4 cup of maple syrup

Before I found this recipe I found one that did not have banana or milk of any kind.  I used honey instead of agave and added vanilla.  I used raspberries instead of coconut. It was amazing.  It has been a long time since I have been able to eat a dessert due to all kinds of food allergies so I am very excited.

This is very good!! I'm finding that everytime I have a serving, I want seconds.
I used a rather small avacado, all I had, I'm looking forward to making this again with larger one--hoping pudding turns out thicker. I did not use coconut, as I didn't have any.
Next time, I also think I will add a 1 Tbs or 2 of peanut butter, yum!

There are some amazingly talented "health" food geniuses out there! This tasted a lot like chocolate pudding. it had the right texture too. It all blended up so quick and smooth in my Vitamix mixer. The only change I made was using unsweetened almond milk instead of soy and using a frozen sliced banana. I highly suggest using a frozen banana. The pudding will be nice and cold and perfectly thickened as pudding should be. I would also definitely stick with the agave. It is sweeter than honey and it doesn't have any real specific flavor. Thanks, this will come in handy for a sweet but healthier way to satisfy a craving.

Really wanted to love this but it was just ok. Maybe my avocado wasn't ripe enough because the whole thing had a "green" sort of taste. Ended up throwing some chocolate chips in to make it more edible, probably ruining all the nutritional value of it. I may try again though.

Being wheat, dairy and sugar free can be challenging when it comes to dessert, but this recipe was great - even a hit with serious pudding eaters. Thank you for sharing. For a whipped topping, you could chill a can of whole, organic coconut milk in the fridge overnight and then, whip the cream at the top with a few drops of stevia or other natural sweetner.

I followed the recipe as written, except used coconut milk instead of soy, and it was soooo delicious! It's hard to believe how healthy this is!! The texture was so smooth and creamy, and it satisfied my sweet tooth.  If you want something really sweet, add a little more agave or honey, but I wouldn't change a thing!

Delicious! I used regular milk and hot cocoa drink powder rather than the raw cocoa, no agave nectar and no coconut- and it was soooo good. Thanks!

Our family of 6 LOVES this recipe! We are working to become cleaner eaters and this was just the ticket for a tasty dessert. I did however add just a couple of tablespoons of stevia to it, after all we still are working on our sweet teeth!!! Thanks so much for making the transition easier.

AMAZING! I am gonna share this with all my friends especially mums... my daughter who usually won't touch avacado loved it! It's great as it satisfies my sweet craving on a raw diet! I changed the soy milk for almond milk as I find it's tastier but apart from that don't change a thing it's puuuuurfect! yummy!

This recipe is great. I did not have any cocnut and used organic milk because that is all I had on hand. It does taste like chocolate, bannana pudding, but I love that combo.

It is true you can't taste the advocado, but it sure does need some added sweetness. I added honey and vanilla but it still came out tasting like a chocolate-banana shake, not a chocolate pudding.

Honestly, I was pretty disappointed after the rave reviews I read. I followed the recipe, but substituted honey for the agave nectar, and added a few cacao nibs in addition to the cocoa powder. I am a fan of healthy eating and whole foods, but I think there are tastier ways to do it. Sorry, but thanks for sharing anyway! It certainly is one of the most creative recipes I've ever tried!

I made this for healthy breakfasts.  I did use the unsweetened coconut, which did give it a nice texture with it was shredded up by the blender.  I garnished with some semi-sweet chocolate chips and kiwi slices.  It could have been sweeter (and I don't like sweets), but I think it is because I used honey instead of agave nectar.  Also, I used 2 avocados because the ones I bought were small and I ended up with 4 pretty large servings.  Bonus:   super easy

Really enjoyed this healthy alternative to regular store bought pudding (which I find too sweet and syrup tasting). I used coconut milk and honey (things I had in hand at the time). Went with another reviewer's advice about using a green banana and overripe avocado- delicious! Next time I will add ground up almonds.

My husband always licks the spoon after I finish making a dessert.  I didn't tell him it was a healthy vegan dessert.  But there was no fooling him. He said it tasted too healthy and green.  Oh well.  I loved it.
I used almond milk instead of soy and maple syrup instead of agave.  Turned out beautifully.  Will make again.

I liked this. I don't really think it is necessary to refrigerate it for an hour. Right after I blended it it had a great consistency. Good enough for consuming. However I did use real milk, and I wonder if this had anything to do with the setting of the pudding. It tasted like a vegan food, which I like.  My boyfriend commented  on the taste though. We both thought the avocado was a neat idea.

Just made this and it's fabulous!  I am so glad I tried it!  Even my kids loved it!  I did leave out the lemon because I didn't have any in the fridge, but I followed it the rest of the way and it was just delicious!  I saved a little for lunch tomorrow, hope it doesn't separate over night.  Thanks for my new favorite treat!

Delicious.  I wanted it a bit sweeter so I added a teaspoon on raw honey - more nutritional bang and so good.  Kids and husband went wild.

I was really excited to try this recipe and was sadly disappointed. The avocado I used wasn't quite ripe so I'm not sure if that was the problem or something else. The texture was kind of chunky and unpleasant. I'm going to try to make it again in a couple of days to see if it turns out better.

I agree with some of the other reviews. The banana was a bit over powering. I think next time I make this I will only use 1/2 a banana and omit the coconut. I didn't like the texture the coconut gave it. I did like the chocolaty flavor, and the look on my husbands face when I told him it had avocado in it.... was priceless. I will make it again. It was super easy.

I'm a pretty good cook, and I've never had trouble with any recipe on this site, but this one just did not work out.  I followed the recipe very closely and used fresh ingredients, but when I tasted it, it was terrible.  I could taste the avocado, the lemon juice, and the banana, and it was NOT a good combination.  I ended up adding some vanilla and finally 1/4 to 1/2 cup of powdered sugar just to make it slightly palatable.  I'm all for health benefits, and our family eats pretty healthy on a daily basis, but healthy pudding does no good if it goes straight into the garbage.  I'm giving it two stars only because it was salvageable (although it remains to be seen whether or not my kids will eat it).

Yumm!!!!!  This was one of only 2 agave recipes on allrecipes.com.  I have made avocado drinks with milk and sugar for years.  My children beg for it, so I wasn't surprised that this was very good.  I really enjoyed it!  Thanks for the unique recipe.  Do you have some more agave recipes?

Thank you Alex, for sharing this wonderful recipe.  Followed directions exactly except to substitute honey for agave.  I find honey a bit sweeter and will try 1 1/2 Tbls. next time instead of 2 Tbls.  My husband watched me make this and was reluctant to try it.  Once he did, he agreed that it is absolutely delicious!

Good recipe, but the description is not accurate- all the ingredients aren't raw.  The avocado, banana, and cocoa powder are, but soy milk isn't raw, agave may or may not be depending on what kind you buy, as well as the lemon juice (if it is in a bottle, it is pasturized), and the coconut is also processed.   My son really likes this recipe, but I find it to taste too much like avocado.

I love this pudding!  I followed the directions exactly, except I only had vanilla flavored soy milk on hand - my husband commented that the pudding was a little too sweet - that's probably why.  But it was still so good!  We will make this again and again.

YUMMY!  I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa instead of raw, since that's all I had.  Also used skim milk and it worked well.  My kids loved it too and thought it was the best breakfast in the world.

The taste  just like chocolate pudding!  I get my chocolate fix and some good or me nutrients  -  so I don't feel (too) guilty.  I froze my pudding to satisfy my other guilty pleasure ice cream!  I will make again for sure .

AMAZING! I was super skeptical, but man this was awesome! Have to let it chill completely to pull it off, though. I took others advice and added 1/2 tsp vanilla. Tricked my 4 year old into thinking it was her sweet treat for the day so I have no complaints...except it was hard to get her to share it! I loved it. Could serve at a kids party as pudding parfaits and noone would ever know. Stellar job.

This is not just a healthy recipe pretending to taste good. It is actually good. I used almond milk and half dutch cocoa and half chocolate nibs for the chocolate. Put it in my NutriBullet and it was ready in seconds. Will definitely make again.

I liked how simple it was to make. I regret having added coconut flakes. I don't think they go well with the pudding. My boyfriend described the flavor as "vegetably", but I liked it.

I just made it, it's setting in the fridge, I licked the bowl - absolutely added some around 2 Tbs raw peanut butter and a dash of vanilla. I'm so excited!!! It won't need so long to set as it's already creamy. Oh right, I used coconut milk as well...and some maple and honey instead of agave. Whatever, it's amazing and I'm psyched to eat something healthy that is so yummy!

I'm a huge texture person, and I'm not one for avocados. So, while the avocado flavor wasn't there, I could still slightly taste the slime. It had just a tad too much banana flavor as well. However, my mom LOVED IT. She says it's the best pudding she's ever had. So if you're not bugged by avocado slime, it's obviously really good.

I just made this recipe tonight.  It is delicious!  It is amazing that by using an avocado and banana and using no processed sugar, just natural, you can come up with a chocolate pudding.  I will enjoy this so much more knowing that it is healthy!  I didn't put the coconut in the recipe and I did use unsweetened almond milk.  I may toast some coconut and put it on top when I have more!

whole family loved this (age 1 thru 34), the banana was detected but nobody detected the avocado. i did have some dairy free milk in the fridge but used dairy to make this also used golden syrup since agave is not easy to come by here. think i might make it with oat milk and (sustainable) palm sugar next time - i instinctively feel that honey will be too flavourful for this recipe

I was hoping this pudding would be a healthy but tasty alternative to a regular chocolate pudding, but I was left disappointed. The pudding didn't have that sweet chocolate taste I was looking for. It just tasted like some type of cocoa powder paste. Ick.

I just made this and thought it was very tasty!  I made it as written, but found it to be too bitter, so I had to add a packet of Stevia.  I find it fascinating that the texture is just like normal pudding!  Thanks!

Very yummy, the addition of banana is a really good idea cos it conceals any "veggie-sh" taste.
Great way of making a dessert extra nutritious.

I try to make healthy snacks for my Grandchildren as often as possible; and while I don't care for avocado my Grandkids do eat Guacamole, so I thought for sure they would really like this pudding. Sorry to be a spoiler here BUT... 2 of my 3 Grandkids didn't care for it. I tasted the pudding as I was making it and it wasn't sweet enough, so I added some honey. Personally I could taste, and smell, the avocado (which was perfectly ripened). Since my Grandkids don't like it, I won't be making it again, but thank you for the recipe.

This is a must try!  I was a little apprehensive about trying this recipe, but was not at all disappointed.  It was really quick and easy.  I made the recipe exactly as written, leaving out the optional coconut.  My kids (ages 2 & 4) did eat it, but took a minute to be convinced that it was chocolate pudding.  It is best really cold.  I put mine in the fridge for an hour and then the freezer for 10 minutes before serving.

This is a great guilt free pudding and it's super healthy! I followed the recipe exactly, turned out excellent. I have made this pudding quite a few times and shared it with friends, who make it often as well. It's a keeper!!!

Very good!  I didn't wait for it to set, but made half of the recipe and ate it all myself
