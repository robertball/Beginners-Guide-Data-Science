I have to disagree with the sponsor's description of this frittata - first of all, it is not "beautiful" -  in fact, it is rather unattractive and unappetiizing looking.  Hard to describe, but rather than vivid color it's almost murky looking (hence, no photo). Neither does it "get an upgrade with softened cream cheese instead of milk to add delicious flavor and creaminess." I often add cream cheese to scrambled eggs (my favorite is with crab and dill) but I always add it in little chunks.  Trying to blend it in was near to impossible and once mixed the consistency was just plain weird and unpleasant. Fluffy, sure, but Hubs described it as being like dough that was not entirely cooked through.  Finally, the basil and oregano just didn't work in this - on pizza yes, eggs, not so good.  I added chopped onion and fresh minced garlic, but the final report from Hubs was, "This is a 'do not make again'."

This was dinner tonight. Really good! I added onions and some leftover broccoli and use canned green chilis instead of green peppers. I used fat free cream cheese and turkey pepperoni. My skillet was smaller than the recipe called for so the cooking time for me was a little longer. Mine puffed up beautifully and was so yummy. I forgot pizza sauce but will remember it next time. This would be a great recipe to use up and leftover meat/veggies

I made this exactly like the recipe but sprinkled shredded mozzarella cheese on top with the cover on after the heat was turned off. It was light and fluffy. My husband loved it! I will make it again.

Excellent dish!  I needed to use up some pepperoni & found this recipe.  I made it just like the recipe said (minus the green peppers b/c I didn't have any) & sprinkled some mozz. cheese on top.  Yum! Will make again!
