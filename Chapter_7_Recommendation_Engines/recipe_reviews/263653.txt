Y'all, this is SUCH a good breakfast, both health-wise and flavor. I've been trying out various healthy breakfasts for years now (chia seed pudding, overnight oats, etc) and this recipe tops them all. It's high-protein, has tons of fiber, almost no fat (depending on the yogurt you use), and is low calorie. And for how fast it is to prepare and how full you'll feel after eating it...it's just perfect. Great start to your day. Apologies if this is coming off cheesy - I just can't stress how excited I was to find this recipe. My favorite combination is to use just plain Greek yogurt, a cold gala apple (the coldness really does taste fresher!), a handful of frozen blueberries, and some Honey Almond Kashi Go cereal. It's even better with granola, but I'm digging the Kashi for now. But srsly: give.this.recipe.a.go. SO good. Thanks for sharing, Chef John!

I made this recipe and liked it. I will need to acquire a taste for the Bellwether Sheep Milk Yogurt. I definitely would recommend it to others. Glad I stumbled upon the recipe.

Used greek yogourt.  I honestly don't know why I make things so hard for myself when there are easy, tasteful options like this!

This is another great starter recipe from Chef John. I’ve made something very similar for years. Mixed fresh berries, raw oats, and nonfat Greek yogurt work remarkably well. If you assemble it the night before, the oats will soften by the time you’re ready to have breakfast at work.

It's pretty good, but I don't understand why the apple needs to be cold. By the time it's chopped, it's room temp. Do put a dash of cinnamon...

I added a dusting of cinnamon to the yogurt but I love this breakfast idea so healthy and it really fills you up. I also experimented with different granola cereals for the topper.
