Very easy to make. I have made this three times and have gotten rave reviews. It is not as sweet as some of the others which means you can have a bigger slice! I used chocolate graham crackers (crushed) for the crust. One hint **to crush cookies or graham crackers put them in a gallon sized ziplock bag and use a rolling pin. It helps make crumbs more even. Then add the melted butter into the bag with the crumbs. It helps distribute it more evenly and cuts the mess. 
This cheesecake will crack if overbaked. Check it at about 45 to 50 min.

This is a great and easy recipe.  The consistency was better than I expected and the filling was not too sweet.  I did not make my own crust -- used store-bought chocolate graham crust. Use mini-chocolate chips and add after baking for 10 minutes as they will sink to the bottom otherwise.

My mom has made this cheesecake from an Eagle Brand recipe since I was a small child. It is so tasty and delicious - a no fail recipe! Very easy to make as well.

I was only 20 when I tried this recipe last year and this also was the first recipe that I ever followed and I did it with ease.  It tastes wonderful.  A tip would be to melt some of the left over chocolate chips in a simmer pan and add a little flour and pour it on top of the cake for an extra kick of flavor. My family and friends loved it!

Very easy cheesecake recipe.  It did crack on me once - which happens a lot with cheesecakes - so I iced it with cool whip and sprinkled some more mini chocolate chips on top - and no one knew!  My husband requests this cheesecake for every special occasion and insists it is the creamiest and best tasting cheesecake he has had.  Most people are shocked to find out it is homemade.

I have been using this cheesecake recipe for over 10 years. Friends and family love it and it has one a few competitions as well!   A couple tips to make for a prettier cheesecake. For the first half of the baking time, cover your springform with foil. This will help to keep the cheesecake from getting too brown. The second half will be just enough time for your cheesecake to bake to a picture perfect color.   Second, one of the reasons cheesecake, pumpkin pie etc. cracks is because of the cold air. I cool the cheesecake completely in the oven, allowing it to come to room temperature at a very slow pace. This minimizes/eliminates cracking. You do have to adjust your baking times a bit, but it is well worth it. Chill and enjoy!
