This is a very different good salad.  I followed the recipe amounts exactly but did use one 3 oz. sugar free jello and one 3 oz. regular.  Also used the fruit cocktail that is sweetened with Splenda and pineapple in its own juice so calories were reduced.  Tasted GREAT!

Fabulous & Refreshing!  I changed this just a little, using mandarin orages instead of fruit coctail and cream cheese instead of N. cheese plus I used 1/4 cup more carrot.  I messed up and used 2 cups of water to make the gelatin and it was still perfect.  Try this, you WILL like it.

This was yummy. I also used sugar free jello, light cream cheese, celery,and mandarin oranges because this is what I had on hand instead of the other items. I've been trying different jello recipes here and finally found one I like.

I made this as a dessert and was quite happy with how it turned out. I didn't want to use fruit cocktail, so I added some extra carrot (I used 3 instead of one, next time I'll only use 2, it was a bit too much carrot). I used sugar free jello (2-0.32oz packages) and I only had an 8oz package of Neufchatel cheese, so I doubled the water and the mayo. Yum. I did forget to add the vinegar, and I think I'm glad that I did. I might try adding it next time. But I don't think that it needed anything else.

I wasn't sure about this recipe with the mayo and vinegar.  It turned out great!  I used the mandarin oranges suggested by another review.  Took it to a family picnic and came home with an empty bowl.  Enough said!!  Thanks

I used sugarfree jello.  The dish was tasty yet my family refused to eat it--too many 'things' in it. I won't make it again because of this.

This is similar to a dish that I remember from my childhood.  I am trying to make recipes that use things I already have in my kitchen and this fit the bill.  I did sub mandarin oranges instead of fruit cocktail.  I also used regular mayo.  I was skeptical about the addition of mayo and vinegar but I don't think you could taste either.  The salad itself was a little less sweet than your normal gelatin salad which is a positive in my book.  We both enjoyed this very much and I will be making it again.

This is a favorite in my house.  It's one of those side dishes that both adults and kids will like.  Plus I love an excuse to use Grandma's gelatin mold. ;-)

We love this!  I use sugar free gelatin, and skip the fruit cocktail to keep the carbs down for me, but otherwise, it's a great recipe that reminds me of growing up.
