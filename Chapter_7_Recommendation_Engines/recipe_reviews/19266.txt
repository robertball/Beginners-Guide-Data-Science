Who gave out my mother's Receipe??  This has been my favorite Christmas cookie since I was a little girl.  My mother had to hide them from us or she wouldn't have any left for the cookie tray!

My mother's recipe called these *Sugar Plums*.  We rolled them into balls and then used multi-colored sugars to roll them in.  Which ever way you choose, these are just AMAZING!  I've always loved these...worth the extra trouble.

I like the flavor, but found shaping them too time consuming & not worth the effort.  Next time, I'll just roll them in balls, skip the frosting & serve in cupcake papers. Chewy & tasty.

Who gave out our family's wedding/shower cookie recipe?  This is a big favorite of mine. There are other versions but this is the one I know. A little labor intensive but worth it. Add these to a tray of mixed cookies for a beautiful garnish. You can break a wooden toothpick  in half and dye it with green food coloring for a stem. Notice there is no picture...they go quickly.

I never heard of these before. My wife described them to me based on memories she had as a child.  Her grandmother had made them during Christmas.

So a quick search revealed this recipe. I always find it difficult to make something I never had before.   I followed the recipe exactly, not knowing what to expect, and they were excellent! Probably the most difficult step is chopping the dates as they are pretty sticky.  If I made it again, I might reduce the amount of butter as these were literally dripping while shaping into a strawberry.  Or I might add more rice stuff to soak up the butter.

I can't wait to set these on the table for my mother-in-law as it will no doubt bring back a lot of fond memories.  I'll get some major brownie points with this!

Thanks for a great recipe!

I really wanted to like this recipe, but - while it wasn’t terrible - I don’t think I would make them again. I had a little trouble getting the sugar to stick, so I lightly brushed the surface with water and that solved the problem. Sadly, the grittiness of the sugar made the cookie even less enjoyable.

Very unique and love the no-bake idea. My daughter (obviously) loved rolling the 'strawberries' in the red sugar. Mine turned out hideous-er than the images, but I'll definitely be trying again as it is tasty too.
