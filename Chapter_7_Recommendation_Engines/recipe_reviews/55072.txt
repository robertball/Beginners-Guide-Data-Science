I have used this recipe many times!  I do not put the onion juice in.  After I drain the clams I add the lemon juice immediately and let it sit for about 3-5 min.  (takes away the fishy taste) Other than that this is the recipe that i have been enjoying for years.  It's great for entertaining!  Kids and seafood haters alike love it!  If you don't tell them what's in it they could clean the bowl.  :)

My family has made this recipe for years with rave reviews everywhere it goes.  The only thing you might want to add for a little "kick" is a shake or two of tabasco sauce.  Gives it just the right touch to avoid being bland.

This is the basic clam dip recipe I've made for years. Originally found it on the label of the minced clams; now I had to search for it here. I usually make double this amount and make one of the cans of clams CHOPPED, not minced, so there are a mix of larger and smaller chunks. Yum!

I make this dip slightly different. Omit onion juice and use sour cream instead of cream cheese. Top with lots of pepper and seasoned salt. Super Yummy!

This is a great clam dip recipe. I hadn't had clam dip for years and stumbled across this recipe a few weeks ago. I've made it for the last two football weekend parties and, by popular demand serving it up a third time for Super Bowl 45. I added one additional can of drained clams. When mixing in the clam juice, I liked the consistency reached by adding not quite one full can of the clam juice.   A few dashes of Tabasco was also added. Love this recipe.

I followed the suggestion to let the clams "marinate" in the lemon juice. No onion juice on hand but a few shakes of Frank's Red Hot Sauce.  My "I don't like clam dip" hubby loved it along with our guests.  I caught him cleaning the bowl with his finger in the kitchen....

I was looking for a cold, creamy clam dip, and this was delicious.  Very easy to make.  I have never heard of onion juice, so I didn't use it, but it wasn't missed.  I reserved the clam juice, but ended up pouring it out, because it was the perfect consistency without it.  Little did I know, that after it sat for a while, it got very thick and I wished I had saved it.  I ended up adding a little milk to thin it out, which worked fine.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

12.9.09 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/55072/creamy-clam-dip/ ... Added a little minced onion instead of juice.  Made the mistake of draining the clams, blending cream cheese, etc; then adding all the liquid back in.  Next time, I'll wait for it to thicken in the refrigerator before adding liquid back.  It was good, but too thin.  K, 10, liked it.  Surprise.  Easy, worth trying.

This was really quite tasty!  I used my zester for the onion so it was almost like onion juice.  I drained almost all the liquid from the clams and it was a perfect consistency.  I will make this again.

Man is this good!  Definitely reserve some of the liquid from the clams to help you obtain the desired creamy consistency.

My family really enjoyed this, it was like a garlic, onion, clam dip all rolled into one, I did add a little salt to bring out the flavors also. Very simple recipe too!

I am so happy to have found this recipe, as I couldn't find clam dip in any supermarkets anymore. This is even better than the store-bought dips were...and so easy to make! (I used grated onion instead of just juice)

Success!  This recipe was a wonderful addition to my Christmas Eve buffet!  Rather than adding onion juice (which I think is a pain to create) I added onion powder and onion salt.  Chopped onions also give it a lovely crunchy texture.  My East Coast, seafood loving boyfriend devoured it!

WONDERFUL recipe!
Took the advice of a reviewer and added about a Tablespoon of the sriracha hot sauce, it just gives it a nice flavor, not hot at all!  I used Neufchâtel cheese instead of cream cheese, as it is softer (and fewer calories) (find it right next to cream cheese in the store).  I kept adding clam juice until it was smooth and creamy.  I grated onion very small and it made juice, too.

I made this again yesterday.  I've made several times and just realized I never left a review.  I love this recipe. It is very similar to a dip my mother made when I was younger.  I've made exactly as written and I've tweaked it a little.  Can't hurt this recipe.  It's a great dip and every time I make it I'm reminded of home. Comfort food for my family.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great dip that goes together super quick. I added more lemon in place of the onion juice because I love lemon. I also doubled the clams which I was worried it would be too much clam taste but it turned out perfect. I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of Frank’s Red Hot. Will be making this again and again!

Like many others, I did not include any onion juice, but it came out very satisfactory nonetheless. I will be using this recipe for a long time to come.

Nice recipe. I did half cream cheese and half sour cream, which is how I’m used to making this. I also added a few dashes to Tabasco sauce and garnished it with spring onions on top.

I condensed the clam juice, cooled, and added to the cream cheese. Threw in a 1/2 tsp. horseradish for some kick, and grated the onion and added it.

After over forty years of making our Mom's hallowed clam dip recipe, we tried this.  It is FANTASTIC.  We made one change, when we doubled this recipe, we switched out one can of lump crabmeat for the clams. OMG!!!!

I made this with alterations because I wanted the dip to be chunky. I used chopped clams instead if minced. I also doubled the amount of clams, used a white onion about 1/4 and put through the food processor to get fine and juicy. I used 1/2  of a Meyers lemon and the worchestire sauce then blended everything with a hand mixer until whipped! delicious!

Excellent dip, I minced about 2 tablespoons of onion and added that instead of the onion juice.  We loved this recipe!

THE BOMB!  Made exact recipe but also added a tsp. of dried parsley,   and 1/4 cup of sour cream. Used 3 Tbs. of reserved clam juice and saved rest in case needed to thin later. Planned to serve with scoop Frietos but instead used thinly sliced, toasted olive bread.  It was wonderful.  Next time might try an additional can of clams for more flavor and texture (personal taste) and a pinch of salt if not serving with chips or crackers.

Great clam dip just like my mom always made growing up.  I use about 1/2 of the Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice and just used diced onion.  I love this stuff!

Made it as written.  Saved clam juice to mix with leftover dip the next day since it gets very thick.  Also used as a spread on the bread when making roast beef sandwiches.

We make this quite often, and we love this recipe. However, I do use 2 cans of clams and  also use all or most of the clam juice and allow it to sit for several hours or I make it the day before.

My family loved this! I used minced onion instead of onion juice and followed suggestions here by adding a second can of clams and 2 dashes of hot sauce. Even the picky kids ate it and informed me I need to make more.

Very easy to make and it does not last very long (it gets gobbled up).
