I have made these sausage rolls for years. I use the hot sausage, add bean sprouts, matchstick carrots and green onion. Very tasty!

These were sooooo good! I wanted to make these for a long time.  I love egg rolls and finally tried them.  AWESOME! The only addition I made was to add soy sauce to the mixture.  Will definitely make again!

I have always loved egg rolls and I wanted to make them myslef.  This recipes is great.  Everyone loves when I make them and I have shared this recipe with many friends and family members.   I could go into business for myself.
