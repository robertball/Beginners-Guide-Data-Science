Looking for a new way to make salmon, and this one turned out well.  I omitted cilantro because I do not like it, but added a bit of rosemary and thyme in its place.  Friend suggested adding a bit of diced tomato and chopped ripe olives to mixture - which I will do the next time I make this.  Served with rice pilaf and steamed spinach for a quick and easy "healthy" dinner.  Thanks, Ariel101.

We spread about 2 T minced garlic over the salmon, brushed with olive oil and balsamic (not the whole amount) and  covered with chopped fresh basil.  We baked without turning instead of broiling. It couldn't have been better.

This is a good, simple recipe for salmon.  The salmon flavor really comes through, and is not hidden by the other ingredients.  I cut both the olive oil and vinegar in half, and it was more than enough to cover my 1 pound-plus salmon filet.  You don't need that much oil/vinegar.  I also only used 3 garlic cloves, because I was serving something else garlicky.  I didn't have any cilantro, so I tripled the basil.  And finally, I only sprinkled on a little garlic salt, it would have been way too salty with all of it.  Went well with Calabrese Style Spaghetti (from this site) and fresh corn on the cob.

This one is a five star after making a few adjustments. This recipe was just crying out for fresh rosemary rather than cilantro, and I'm so glad I made that call. I left out the garlic salt, just going with the fresh garlic rub, as I didn't see the need for it. The marinade went over salmon steaks which we placed on the bbq, herb side up, turning after 10 minutes and cooking for a total of 15. Absolutely divine. Amazing flavor.

This recipe is superb!!!  My kids and I loved it, and I know my husband will love it too!!  I did cut back on the olive oil.  (used about 1/4 - 1/3 cup instead)  Didn't have cliantro so I used Italian Parsley in it's place.  EXCELLENT!!!

Really enjoyed it!  I made it with something else and so cooked at 400F, turning once, and then broiled for 5 min.  I didn't have cilantro, but I'm going to get it for next time.  I found it worked well.  I agree that it didn't require as much olive oil - I'm going to try 1/4 cup next time.  Cheers!

Both my boyfriend and myself really loved this marinade. It works just as well on swordfish and is so quick and easy that I will definitely make this again.

I would give it 4, but my picky eaters loved it, so it deserves a 5. I baked it at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes. I don't like cilantro, so I used fresh rosemary and omitted basil and garlic salt. I also reduced oil to 1/4 c. It was tasty.

We usually fix salmon the same way all of the time, so I was looking for something different, and this fit the bill!  We really enjoyed this with our Panzanella salad tonight.  The flavors in both dishes complimented each other so well.  I did cut back a bit on the olive oil to make it more WW friendly.

I was very impressed with this recipe. Just the fact that it takes less than half an hour to make is wonderful, but the results are very tasty, which is extra wonderful! I did not have any cilantro on hand, so I made this without that, but I followed the rest of the recipe as is. I would add LESS olive oil next time... it was a little too much! 15 minutes would have been way too long for my salmon (it was more like 11-12 min), but maybe my fillets were smaller than the recipe called for. My husband was very happy with this and so was my daughter. Thanks for the fast and yummy recipe, Ariel!

I don't often take the time to give a review, but this recipe is very good!  I used it on Chilean steelhead with fresh cilantro but only had dried basil on hand.  Was generous with both herbs, and drizzled a bit more basalmic before serving.  WOW!  I probably was a bit generous with the garlic as well because I like a lot of flavor and this delivered.  We couldn't get enough and I will definitely serve this for guests.  I coupled it with a mediterranean brown rice salad with lots of veggies and it is a keeper.  Great flavor and served over a leaf of lettuce for guests would be very eye pleasing.

This was easy to make but it lacked flavor.  I made slits in the salmon so the marinade would penetrate better.  I cut way back on the oil and just drizzled it, the balsamic and seasonings over the salmon.  I let it marinate for about 10 minutes then baked it for 18 minutes at 400 degrees.

Aside from substituting parsley for cilantro, adding a sprinkling of garlic powder, and leaving out the salt, I followed the rest of the recipe. It is really really good. Definitely a keeper. But I would marinate it longer so it gets more of the balsamic flavor, and definitely add the salt next time.
I took inspiration from the picture and sprinkled on shredded mozzerella. i like it, but I think parmesan or maybe cheddar would be better.

Simple and delicious! I boiled 2 potatoes while the salmon marinated, sliced it up and broiled with the fish.

ntastic, I was looking for a recipe that was new and I found it. I did add a spoonful of capers and 2 plum tomatoes to the fish. After I let it cool and served it over romaine lettuce, baby spinach and kalamata olive then grated fresh romano cheese on top....it was so good!! I'll definately make this again, thank you

I loved this recipe!!!  I did change it a bit.  I added a coat of tomato paste to the fish and use basmic vinergette dressing on top-instead of seperating the two ingredents.  I will definately make this one again.

My family, to include my children, LOVE this recipe. It is simple, quick & tastes great. In the absence of garlic, fresh cilantro and basil, I once used garlic powder & bottled cilantro and basil. It still tasted great. When I don't have fresh fish, I have used frozen, preparing it the same way. Still turned out fabulously. I don't think one could ruin this recipe. I definitely recommend it.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I really liked it.  I too decreased the oil and omitted the garlic salt.  I only had fresh basil, so I used more of that.  Blended the oil, vinegar, garlic and basil together, salted and peppered the fish and spread the oil mixture over.  Let it stand in the refrigerator while I completed my evening chores.  Instead of broiling, I baked the salmon in a foiled lined dish at 400 for 20 minutes.  When I asked husband how he liked it, he said that he liked his fish with lemon, or something citrusy.  He scraped off the basil.  If he had liked it, I would have given it 5 stars.  Thanks!

Kind of bland for my taste but the flavor was nice.  Watch the cooking time.  I didn't cook as long as the recipe says, maybe only 12 minutes and it was cooked perfectly.

Would've rated it 3 1/2 if I could.  It wasn't bad - not amazing but not bad.  I should've read the reviews ahead of time (which I usually do) because it was a bit oily as written.  Tasted good but I've had better on this site so I'll probably stick to those.

OK...I love salmon and love balsamic vinegar so I thought this would be fabulous. It wasn't. For some reason, the flavors just didn't seem to work together. Not sure why. I can say, it was MUCH better the next day for lunch. I don't think I'll be making this one again.

This recipe is great for a fast dinner. It tastes great and is very simple. My boyfriend really enjoyed this recipe, he thought it took hours of marinating to achieve the rich flavor. For even quicker preparation, I use the Foreman grill so both sides cook at once.

This was simple, quick, and delicious. I used a large, single salmon filet (halved the recipe) which I split in two and served over spaghetti squash and roasted vegetables.

Excellent.  I had some fresh rockfish and used this recipe.  I didn't have to cook it quite as long, but it was fabulous!  I served it over spinach slightly sauteed in galic, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  A healthy and tasty meal.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks.

I used balsamic vinegar, garlic, basil, omitted the cilantro, and much less olive oil (I just eye-balled it). 15 minutes was a tad too much for the salmon I used, so I will take a closer look next time.  I added some sliced onions to the side of the salmon when it was cooking to give them a balsamic flavor as well. Delicious! Thanks for the simple recipe!

15 min was too long but my family loved the flavor of the fish.  I made it just as the recipe said.

Pretty good. I used maybe 2-3 T of basil, a clove of fresh garlic, and 2 cloves of roasted. Also added salt and lots of fresh cracked pepper. Very flavorful. Might make again with additional tweaking.

Everyone LOVED this dish!  I doubled the marinade so I could cover the salmon (I used a half of a salmon and marinated in a 9 X 13 glass baking dish).  Served with sauteed veggies (yellow squash, asparagus, red pepper, and carrots) and couscous.  It was quick and easy!

I cooked this as the recipe says, I made no changes & served the salmon over a ceasar salad. The salmon was good, but it wasn't amazing by any means. Just ok. I probably won't be making it again.

Excellent Salmon! The hubby loved it. You do need less oil. But everything else I did exactly, except I used more fresh herbs. I love fresh herbs! Enjoy!

I made this recipe for my family dinner today and it was a success.  I was in the mood for raw salmon so after letting it sit in the fridge I set half aside as a marinated raw salmon dish.  It was amazing!! I did omit the cilantro though and I let the dish marinate in the fridge for a few hours rather than 10 min.

I loved the idea of adding diced tomatoes & chopped black olives, but I also added chopped capers & some caper juice, which went very well. I also used thyme & rosemary in place of the cilantro as suggested by another member. Great broiled, my three pieces were ready in 13 minutes. I recommend cover with foil during the last few minutes to prevent oven fires.

I usually only get to eat salmon when eating out as I'm the only one in the family who likes it. I couldn't resist when the supermarket had scottish salmon on sale though. This was quick and easy and just as good as any I've had in a restaurant. I cooked just as stated and enjoyed every bite. Many Thanks.

Great recipe for salmon.  I used white balsamic because I like it better.  Next time I would use less vinegar, I tend to over-do the vinegar in recipes and it becomes very potent.  I love fresh cilantro and basil and this was a great combo of the two!  Thanks for the recipe.

Good, I liked, liked the use of vinegar and cilantro--a nice change--I don't use either ingredient much, hubby didn't like this one at all, but he doesn't really like fish. So I probably won't make it again. thanks

Easy and delicious! I reduced the oil and balsamic in half.  I used salmon filets about quarter inch thick, and i brolied on one side only for about 3-4 minutes. I paired with naan bread and roasted squash with yogurt sauce (see recipes on my profile)

Yum!  I followed the recipe except with the garlic salt -- didn't have any, plus the amount called for seemed like garlic/sodium overkill.  I simply sprinkled regular kosher salt instead.  My total broiling time was far less than the 15 mins stated, probably more like 11mins.  The salmon was moist as can be!  I'll definately make this one again!

Salmon is one of my favorites, but... this seemed to lack flavor. I read the other reviews and cut back on the olive oil, and substituted thyme and rosemary, per another reviewers suggestion... It was just okay.

Great flavor combination for salmon!  I'm always looking for more ways to enjoy fish and will definitely add this to my regularly-used collection.  Since I used the 1 clove of pressed garlic per fillet, as called for, I used regular Kosher salt instead of garlic salt and thought the garlic flavor was just right.  I did cut the oil and vinegar in half so as to cut back on waste, but if you really want the sides of the fish to be down in the marinade, use the full amount.  I also broiled it on my broiling pan instead of in the glass dish (covered the pan with a sheet of aluminum foil for care-free cleanup!).

I, too, used 1/4c oil. Still good if you don't have cilantro but outstanding with it. My man raved about it and kids (1 yr and 3 yr) gobbled it up. It is IMPORTANT to use the method described for best results. I've tried just making a marindade of it all and also cooking it in the marinade but neither one approach the flavor you get from following the instructions to the "T".

This is a great easy recipe that I will make again and again. It masks the strong salmon taste...which I prefer. It's different than any other salmon dish I have had. I made it without the garlic salt or cilantro because I didn't have it on hand. I added salt & pepper. Really loved it!!

Was a three star as written.  With a bit less oil and the addition of fresh diced tomatoes it was a 5 for sure.

My husband thought this fish recipe was very good, but I thought it was the best fish I've ever had!!! I took the advice of other reviewers and used about half the amount of oil.

this was just Ok for my taste but I gave it a 4 because my kids loved it so much, they are 10.  husband also said it was very good.  I will still search for  a better salmon recipe that we ALL love but every bit of this one was eaten so it was worth making and didn't go to waste.  this recipe could use less olive oil if you plan to make it.

This was one of those recipes that was done in a hurry. I needed something quickly (hubby was off out and I only had a limited amount of food in stock).  I looked up the ingredients Salmon and Balsamic Vinegar and this was one of the first ones that came up.  What a fabulous creation.  It was really, really tasty.  Unfortunately here in England the supermarkets have taken over to such a degree that a lot of our basic ingredients no longer have any flavour. But this worked, and the Salmon tasted great.  A keeper.

This is one of my favorite dishes to make, I sometimes leave out the cilantro when I run out, but it doesn't make a huge difference. The only thing I can say about this recipe that isn't positive is that my neighbors in our small complex complain about how strong the red wine vinegar smells. I make it at least once a month.

I must first honestly state that I haven't tasted the recipe b/c I don't eat fish.  But I make fish for my husband and guests on a regular basis and my husband has heartfully declared that this is his FAVORITE fish I have ever made. I don't have garlic salt so I just use garlic powder, and I mince the garlic rather than press it, but these are really not alterations...Thanks for a popular and EASY recipe!

Not bad, but not remarkable.  However, my husband was pleased with this and thought it was good, so will use the recipe again.  Maybe I will play with the seasonings or add some fresh ginger --

So easy and so good. I just didn’t feel like the sweet typical salmon.  This was a delicious change up. Can’t wait to make this one for company. All I had for balsamic was a “fig balsamic”  although it made the salmon look quite brown it was not burned or over cooked and added an interesting complexity to the finish.

I made this per instructions and found it to be VERY bland. My husband and son thought it was just ok. I’d rate it 2 stars but I added another star for my families opinion. I won’t make this again.

Didn’t have any cilantro on hand so I followed another reviewer’s lead and used rosemary and thyme - only other change was adding fresh squeezed lime juice once plated - very easy and top shelf - thanks!

Cooked as directed with minor changes. Left the salmon in the marinated dish for cooking, and in the actual balsamic mixture. Added quartered tomatoes to top and left uncovered to cook. The tomatoes crisped and gave extra texture. I also drizzled heavy cream over the top (about a tablespoon) when plated right before serving. Was simple yet amazing!!!

It was delicious.  I made it according to the recipe except that I used a single large salmon filet, which I divided into servings after cooking.  I plan to make it again.

I made with the exact ingredients just reduced the oil and balsamic vinegar to half due to having a smaller portion of salmon. I used dried basil as I did not have fresh  I also cooked on convection roast 400F for 20 minutes. I had a thicker cut of salmon (skin on) and cooked 10 minutes uncovered and 10 minutes covered. I basted one time and did not flip.

Quick, easy, and flavorful way to grill salmon. The marinade did do a number on my baking dish....I'll line it with aluminum foil next time.

My daughter loved this salmon.  I did not use cilantro because I did not have it but I added lemon and blood orange zest.  I doubled the marinate and boiled it with 3 tablespoons of butter to serve on the side.  I will make again!

Was looking for a new way to prepare salmon--this one will definitely become a regular for us!! Didn't have cilantro or fresh basil, used dried basil, skipped the garlic salt since used plenty of fresh garlic. Made a topping of chopped grape tomatoes, chopped black olives and feta cheese--added it during the last two minutes of broiling. But even without the topping, I still rate this 5 stars--great flavor. Also doesn't need 15 minutes to cook--8-10 is plenty. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is an easy but delicious recipe.  I grilled the salmon instead of baking it on an aluminum foil boat (2 sheets of foil and rolled up each side) on hot grill (450°) for about 7-9 minutes until flaky.

Whoa nelly is that a LOT of basil! I think I know what to do for anyone meh about basil. I'd half it, definitely - and another consideration would be mixing everything together at the beginning vs the oil & vinegar separately. Another thing - I LOVE oil and I think this is slightly too much. Maybe 3/4 of what is called for would be best. I thought I had cilantro but didn't so what I did was put one part cumin to two parts parsley. Also, I used garlic POWDER vs. SALT. 

One awesome thing about this recipe, though - never have I ever broiled salmon before. I think*that* is the best part of this recipe. I never would have thought to do it - the skin was wonderfully crispy!

Ended up pan grilling this one, but it came out super tasty regardless. The rating may be a bit biased though since we're salmon-loving fiends the wife and I. We musta been bears in a past life.

I love this recipe. Sooo easy. My husband doesn't like cilantro, so I made it with fresh basil from my garden and he still loved it. I live in the Southwest, where you don't won't the oven on long in the summer, so this was great!! I make it at least every other night!

Delicious! I followed the advice of another review and put diced tomatoes on top with the basil and garnished it with olives after it finished cooking. I also drizzled some balsamic vinegar on it after cooking and I baked it at 350 instead of broiling. I still cant get over how good it was!

Very good!  My fillets must have been thinner - they were done after 10 minutes under the broiler on just one side (145 temp, Costco frozen fillets).  Half as much marinade would work for 12oz of fish.  I broiled plain tomatoes on the same pan and timing worked for them too. Served with Caprese pasta and salad.

This was simple to make and enjoyed by young and old.  Be sure to put the broiler on low.  The smoke this created when the broiler was on high set off the smoke alarms.  I served it with red potatoes and salad.  Will make again.

Followed recipe but added a few shakes of rosemary and thyme as well, power was out so I cooked it on the stovetop as opposed to broiling.  Very light, very tasty and not overpowering.

Didn't have basil so omitted it, but it was excellent!!!! We left the skin on one side of our salmon and didn't bother to flip it, and it was still cooked just right, not a bit dry. The rub was perfect.

Good, but not amazing. Like others, I cut the oil in half (no more is needed), and added a little parsley. I marinated the salmon for over an hour, and then baked at 350 for around 20 minutes. The family enjoyed it, although nothing compares to the Maple Salmon on this site.

I cooked the salmon in an aluminum foil pouch to keep it moist. After about 12 minutes I opened the top of the foil pouch and cooked it under the broiler for about another 3 or 4 minutes. Turned out great!

Very tasty and easy to make. Between my wife and mine jobs  and our two daughters time is always a factor in determining our meals. This recipe was not only very tasty but also very easy to prepare. I liked it even more because we got to use fresh herbs and veggies from our garden!!

Nice, light flavors and a quick dinner to make.  I omitted the garlic salt and cilantro, just poured enough olive oil and vinegar to coat the top, and sprinkled a little bit of regular salt on top.  Chopped up more basil since I don't like cilantro.  Baked for about 15-18 minutes in a 375 oven, and it was delicious!

I wanted to really love this one, it sounded fantastic, but the best I can say is that it was just ok.  We didn't hate it, but we definitely didn't love it, and for all the flavor that should have been in this one, it seemed to come out a little bland.  It was kind of disappointing.  I have to say, I probably won't make this one again.

This is an easy go to recipe if you want simplicity and great flavor. A pinch of rosemary in addition works great in this recipe too!

I really like the balsamic vinegar but yet it did not overpower the flavor of the salmon.  I used dried basil since I didn't have fresh.  Also, squeezed a little lemon on it after it was done cooking.  Good recipe, will make it again.

I could not believe how simple turned into restaurant-esque with this recipe!  We have a freezer full of Alaskan salmon and this was the 4th recipe I have used off this site...it has become our #1!  Thank you for sharing!

Made this tonight. I didn't have cilantro so used parsley instead and regular salt instead of garlic salt. It came out pretty darn well, best fish dish I've ever made.

Half a cup of oil is WAY too much for 12 oz fish, not to mention it's salmon which has it's own fat so you shouldn't really need more than a teaspoon of oil per serving.  I found this to be pretty bland, but edible.

Pretty yummy.  Like others, I drizzled a little oil and vinegar on the salmon vs. using the full amount on the recipe.  Baked at 425 for 20-25 minutes.

This was aaaamazing!  I read other reviews and didn't use the cilantro, and instead replaced it with rosemary.  I used 1.5 lbs fresh wild salmon, 1/2 cup oil, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 8 garlic cloves minced, 2 tsp garlic salt, generous amount (over 2 tablespoons) basil and fresh rosemary (I just cut several pieces rosemary from the plant with stem attached, washed well, and placed it over salmon).  Placed everything in a glass dish and marinated for a few minutes, then popped into the oven.  Very easy, healthy, and delicous!  I served it with brown rice, sauteed garlic spinach and some sauteeed mushrooms as sides.  My bf raved about how good the salmon was. The rosemary really does make a difference.

Wow, this is just amazing!  It tastes like a restaurant meal.  I did decrease the vinegar and oil by 1/2 and just used 1 pound of fish.  I did not have any cilantro or fresh basil, so I used 1 tsp dried basil and 1/2 tsp dried thyme.  I also only used 1 tsp garlic salt and rubbed each filet with 1 clove of garlic.  I marinated for about an hour and it was as good as it gets!  One of the best salmon recipes on this site or anywhere else!

While reading the ingredient list, I realized that I had some olive oil-balsamic vinegar dressing that had basically the same ingredients, so I used that for the marinade.  I've found that decreasing the broiling time by a few minutes works well for us, since I broil on the high setting.  Over all, this is sooooo delicious and very easy.  The cilantro is wonderful and really brings out the flavor.  We will definitely make this recipe again and again!!

This is a very tasty marinade that would adapt well to any changes you would care to make to the seasonings added.  I did, however, follow the recipe exactly, and we enjoyed it.  The strong flavor of the marinade does tend to overpower the salmon a bit, but in my case, I didn't mind that at all!

I used this recipe for a small filet of Tilapia.  I didn't use the garlic salt.  I also only used about a tablespoon of the oil and vinegar since I was making a small serving.  I rubbed on the garlic, poured on the sauce and popped it in the oven.  It was a very nice change to the usual way I have fish.

Some of the best Salmon I have ever made.  I did agree that the oil seemed excessive and cut it down to 2 tbsp's which was plenty.  Oh so good!

This recipe is so easy to make. Our family loves fish, so this was perfect for us. My daughter, who is 7, asked for seconds on this one. I have tried it with salmon, rockfish and orange roughy. All of them have turned out wonderful.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!

I'm not a fan of cilantro so I didn't use that, but this recipe was amazing!  I'm already sharing it with everyone who will listen.  Be careful with the broiling, though.  I started out broiling it on HI and it was too hot.  Turned it down to LO, but I still had to watch it very closely so it didn't burn.

This was good.  everyone in my family liked it.   Next time, I would reduce the olive oil and serve with a rice pilaf.

We loved this recipe! I added 1/2 small can of chopped olives and two diced roma tomatoes to the herb mixture and baked the dish for about 15 minutes in a 400 degree oven instead of broiling it. We liked it so much that I think we might try it on chicken too.

This was delicious! I added cherry tomatoes to the recipe and put in about half the amount of cilantro and it came out perfectly. My husband loved it - will definitely make it again!

This was a strange combination of flavors, and the cilantro really overpowered the basil. There are way too many salmon recipes out there to repeat this one.
