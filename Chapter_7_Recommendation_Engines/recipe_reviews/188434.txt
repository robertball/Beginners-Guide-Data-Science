This is a really nice way to use up day old bread. I was confused by the little amount of orange juice called for in this recipe and like the other reviewers felt it needed more. I juiced one fresh orange and got about 1/2 C+ out of it. I also used all of the orange peel called for to give it that nice tart orange taste. The recipe doesn't state when or what step to add the cinnamon so I added it with the sugar/peel/juice. I first put a layer of that on the bottom of the pan, layered the bread, dotted with butter, another layer of the orange sugar mixture and then topped it all off with the egg/milk/cream.  Baked for about 45 minutes.  I also made a homemade orange sauce to serve with it and topped it off with whipped cream and shaved chocolate. Wonderful, wonderful, dessert.

This is really tasty. I had to try this because I love chocolate and orange paired together. I did use orange extract in the butter mixture instead of orange juice. I also used less about about a 1/3 cup of orange juice and decreased the milk by a 1/3 cup in the milk mixture. I used left over homemade bread that I needed to use before it went bad. I did double this recipe. And I am glad I did. My kids loved this as well. Thanks for the recipe.

I used whole grain bread and soy milk.  Due to the density of the bread, I added more milk (3/4 cup).  The orange flavor wasn't there!  Next time, the 3/4 cup will be of orange juice, so I'm sure we'll taste orange!  This is a wonderful tasting chocolate pudding without being super sweet.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have to say if you want to make this a truly amazing dessert (not that it already isn't!!) you should pair it with Avon's Warm Orange Sauce ~ http://allrecipes.com/PersonalRecipe/62652754/Warm-Orange-Sauce/Detail.aspx?prop31=8 ~ and top it with freshly whipped cream! Enjoy!
