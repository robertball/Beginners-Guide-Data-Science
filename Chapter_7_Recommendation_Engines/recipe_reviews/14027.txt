My husband and I loved this dish.  Would suggest using a 9x13 inch dish and reducing the layers to three, and using rectangular tortillas.  Used Pepper Jack cheese.  Also, think it might stay in the oven a bit longer so it is hotter.  I will definitely make again.

This was good and easy.  However, I'm a big fan of spicy dishes and found this to be slightly bland. Would definately add more spices, perhaps chipolte peppers, to the bean mixture and maybe a layer of salsa inside the pie. Some fresh cilantro would be good too. And the recipes really serves just 4.

I get 8 inch tortillas and then bake in an 8 inch cake pan. Works out great!

What a great "clean out the pantry" dinner!  Skipped the olives and peppers, added an onion and two cloves of garlic and used a 2 qrt casserole dish.  Simplfied the seasoning and just added a packet of taco seasoning.  It was so good we forgot to add the sour cream =)  Great meatless fast weekday option; it's now on rotation!

Oh my WOW!!!!  This was fantastic!  I didn't have a deep round cake pan, so I used two shallow ones and 6 tortillas (instead of 5).  THIS WAS SOOOOOO GOOD!  I had a vegan friend over so I substituted tofu cheese and sour cream and my husband couldn't even tell, he loved it and he's a meat eater to the core.  Next time I might play around--add another jalepeno or some onions.  This has become an immediate staple in our house--THANKS!

This recipe is now a staple in our home.  Sometimes I cut the tortillas into quaters and just layer them in a square dish.  It works just as well.  My husband said, "This tastes just like Taco Bell, only better!" (And he loves Taco Bell!)

This is really good. I made this for my Mom and my really picky sister. Both of them loved it. The filling can also be used for burritos. I had enough filling to do two pie tins. Also, try and look for 9 inch tortillas so they fit perfectly in the pan. This save a lot of time cutting the tortillas to fit the pan.

I thought this was very good.  I used one large green chili pepper instead of the bell pepper and jalapenos, which I sautéed for about two minutes with 1/4 cup of chopped onion before I added all the beans.  I also used two ears of fresh corn instead of canned.  I used low-fat Mexican cheese blend.  

Also, I made this in a pie plate instead of a cake pan, and I had too much filling for all the layers, so I only had 3 layers.  I also think the salsa was important for the flavor.  I used some hot salsa, and I think if I had omitted that I would not have liked it as much.  I can see where substituting different kinds of beans would be nice, but the refried beans are definitely key to get it to hold together.  

I will definitely make this again.

A promising dish but a tad bland as written. We will try this again but using a sauté of onion, bell pepper, garlic, fresh cilantro, and upping the spices, before mixing in the beans. Rather than add salsa as a garnish, plan to layer in picante sauce to make this less dry. The pie did not come out piping hot with 20 minutes in the oven, and plan on leaving it in longer the next time.  With some minor tweaking to satisfy our personal tastes, expect this bean pie to make it on our ‘make again’ (5 star) list.  Thank you ADELE21 for sharing.

I was really excited about this recipe, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was dry and heavy.

I'll give it a 4 star with this recommendation. I used fresh black beans, soaked and cooked until tender. I added saute onion and a quick pulse on the food processor for the beans. lots of cayenne pepper to taste, salsa and topped with avocado and plain yogurt

Definately a keeper! Before I became a vegetarian I made a Enchilada Casserole that was pretty darn good. But this is even better! My husband didn't even miss the meat. He claims all vegetarian food tastes the same. I did alter the reciepe a bit. I added a cup on salsa to the bean mix since other reviews said it was a little dry. I only used a tsp of cumin and chopped up fresh cilantro, which I added to the beans right before layering it all together.

A good, solid recipe but would have been very, very dull without the sauces we had with it (pico de gallo, salsa verde, guacamole and sour cream).  We will definitely make again as it's a low-fat, high fiber recipe but I'll add something to the bean mixture to get a bit more flavor.  I do have to say the presentation was lovely - it looked like a layer cake.  I also served it with Homesteader Cornbread from this site - a good match. ETA: I made this again with the three types of beans, 1 can diced chilis, spices, fat free cheese and 5 whole wheat tortillas.  If the pie serves 4 (big pieces) - that's 8 WW points per serving.  Served with pico de gallo and salsa verde it's a fantastic dinner.

I was amazed we all loved this one.  Usually when I try a new recipe someone hates it, but this was a major hit!  I'm passing this recipe out to all my friends!  I did use a little more cheese than it called for.

Very yummy!!!  I found nothing to complain about at all.  It was easy to prepare and tasty to eat.  It suited our quasi-vegeterian lifestyle very well.  (Quasi-vegeterian? I know, it's odd!)  I cook ours in my very well seasoned 10-12" cast iron skillets.  Nothing sticks, they're perfect size and depth (depending on the tortilla size I get), and clean-up is always a snap! I never go wrong with cast-iron cooking.  But the recipe - We're not spicy people so we left out the jalapeños, but other than that we keep to the recipe and enjoy it with a salad, sometimes some rice, and  our drink of choice.  Give it a shot and tweak it your way - you'll probably enjoy it too!

I customized this a bit, which made it less dry and more flavorful.  I added chopped onion and minced garlic, and I didn't cook anything before layering the dish.  I also added chopped tomato for more moisture, and it was great!

I can't believe how good this is!  I left out the can of pinto beans and I am glad I did.  This was already a lot of filling.  I also left out the green pepper because I didn't have one and the jalapeno because I don't like spicy food.  I don't like when people rate without using the exact recipe first, but this was so good I had to.

Great vegetarian meal.  I started by sauteeing some onion and bell pepper, then added some crushed garlic.  Then I added all the ingredients called for, adding a can of diced tomatoes and some onion powder (and leaving out the jalapeno because my hubby doesn't like spicy).  Came out yummy, but next time I think I will smash all the beans with a potato masher for texture purposes.

Very good. Added a small can of mexican tomato sauce to moisten it up. Plus I added a tsp of minced garlic and 1/2 packet of taco seasoning to the refried beans.

This was easy to make - and certainly different. A nice change of pace. But, we actually found it to be a little on the bland side. I won't be making it a second time.

Not sure if I made this right as it stacked up like a layer cake. Could have put it on a cookie sheet rather than sided pan as it never touched the sides. Used veggie product shredded cheese as trying to stay away from dairy whenever possible and turned out just fine. Made a beautiful plate presentation because it sat on the plate like a piece of layer cake and could see all the layers. Drizzled salsa over top and garnished with slices of avocado. Very colorful and delicious! Looking forward to making again.

Although this is a nice idea, it did not have enough flavor...will try again but with salsa in the beans as other reviewers suggested. **Since this recipe has become a staple in our house since adding the salsa (Hot not medium) in the beans this recipe now deserves five stars!!

This was great!  Even my husband, an anti-bean man, had seconds of it.  I didn't use olives or jalapenos in mine.  And, to save on calories, we also did not use sour cream.

I made this tonight and love it, although I did not follow to the T. I didn't veer too much off the original recipe! I used 1 can of corn instead of 1/2 can (I like corn), used corn tortillas (my preference over flour), omitted the green pepper (don't like) and olives (would've used, but didn't have), and added a can of green chiles (did have on hand) after reading other reviews regarding blandness. This is a Mexican version of comfort food!

Changed it up some for our taste. Just a couple spoonfuls of salsa for less heat and made up for flavor with chili powder and cumin.

This is a good idea for a filling meal, but it is pretty bland.  I recommend increasing the spices and adding some salsa right into the bean mixture.  Doing those two things do help the flavor, but the submitted recipe is just too bland for me.  Thanks for sharing, though :)

Easy as pie! (Pardon the pun). I didn't have chili powder on hand (I know, bonehead move), so I used 2 tbsp smoked chipotle Tabasco. It worked AMAZINGLY.  I also used the corn/diced pepper mix and used a red bell pepper, and when I made it the second time (yes, the SECOND TIME), I mixed in chili powder to the shredded cheese before I sprinkled it on, just for an extra kick. Easy, and tasty, especially with a couple of cervesas. (Cervesas optional.) Enjoy!

I made this recipe last night for dinner and everyone loved it.  I used a spring form pan and let it cool for 10 minutes before placing it on a serving platter.  It came out beautifully - I would have taken a picture if my family wasn't chomping at the bit to start eating it!  I didn't give it 5 stars because there was a bit too much cumin IMO.  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!  I added minced garlic and some green chilis, left some of the juice in from the beans, used pepperjack cheese, left the seeds in the jalapeno and did not use olives.  Wonderful clean-out-the-pantry recipe and, much to my surprise, it stayed together pretty well after cutting.  I baked, covered, for 20 min and then 5 more for the cheese on top to brown.  Let sit ~5-10 min before serving.

My contribution to Thanksgiving dinner each year is to make a dish my vegetartian sister can eat. This one was a hit, and even the meat eaters liked it. I made the filling the night before and refrigerated it, then put the pie together and baked it the next morning. I did add extra cheese and salsa as other reviewers suggested, and mixed all of the ingredients together rather than layering them. Great, simple dish!

So easy and tasted great.  My daughter wanted the leftovers for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I did substitute 1 cup of frozen corn for the canned and added a cup of medium salsa to the bean mixture.  Omitted the sour cream.  We'll be having this again!

My husband and I LOVED this easy Mexican Pie.  This has become a favorite.  I did not have a round caserole so I used a rectangular dish and cut the tortillas.

Excellent and simple - only used 4 layers though.
And pepper jack cheese to make it a little spicier.

Love this recipe. I took careful note of the other reviewers comments regarding the lack of spice so I spread salsa on each tortilla before I put the beans on. I also cooked with beans with some pepper relish. Love it. Love it. Love it. This will be a staple. Thanks for the easy great healthy recipe!!!

This is wonderful, but a few changes are suggested, replaced the pepper with a can of green chiles, and added a lot more spices than the recipe calls for like chipotle, garlic and chili powder, also topped with taco sauce, green onions and sour cream.

Yum! I used the three cans of beans, half a larger can of black olives (quartered), the half-can of corn, no green or jalapeno peppers, maybe ½ tsp each of cumin and chili powder, about 2 tsp of taco seasoning, a few grinds of pepper, the 5 tortillas, 2 cups of Mexican blend cheese, and we served it with low-fat sour cream and homemade guacamole. :) I also added half a can of diced tomatoes with chilis (and all the juice from the can) so it wouldn't be dry. Instead of making it in a cake pan, I just lined a cookie sheet with a little cooking spray-sprayed foil and I stacked it there. The bean mixture was thick enough that it didn't ooze out all over and it actually looked quite nice. Fast, easy clean up, and my husband didn't complain about the lack of meat. A winner! Thanks so much for sharing, Adele!

This was Excellent! The only change I made to the recipe was adding salsa to each lalyer and I used pepper jack cheese instead of chedder.   I had a lot of filling left over and I used a little more than 1/4 cup on each layer, so this makes a ton of filling.  That is ok since the others say it freezes well.  Great recipe!

Very good! My whole family loved it, even the die hard carnivores :) I did leave out the can of pintos, since I didn't have any on hand. It was fine with just the black beans and refried beans.

This was good and very, very filling.  I made some changes: used 2 cans pintos instead of black beans, added 1 Tbs. garlic and oregano and halved the cumin and chili powder, used a can of green chilis instead of jalapenos, and did one fewer layer in the cake pan.  It turned out great.  It does need the flavor from the salsa and sour cream though; perhaps next time I will mix in a little salsa.  Overall, both my husband and I enjoyed it very much.

Great idea but really needs improvement. As a vegetarian I found the dish quiet boring. I think chili or cayenne pepper might liven it up a bit.

I've had other recipes similar to this before. It was good and filling but not spectacular. There could have been more flavor, and I think that is due to the amount of beans this recipe calls for. I think it would be better to reduce the bean amount next time and maybe add some vegetables along with more spices.

too much bean!! I think more corn and less refried beans would help. I would probably fix again but I think I would leave pintos out completely, half the refried beans and double the corn. Maybe add salsa on each layer.

Very filling and easy to prepare.  Subbed onion for green pepper (I didn't have one on hand -- if I made this again I'd use both).  We liked how the tortillas got a little crispy.  Definitely serve with sour cream!

This was great!  Easy, fast and healthy too.  I didn't have green or jalepeno pepper so I added about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper for some heat.  It was super yummy and even my 18 month old ate it up.

Very good and easy to throw together. I did add about a half cup of salsa, and glad I did, or I think it may of been too dry. Was also very good the next day as leftover.

Great recipe. I did add diced onion and crushed garlic to the bean mixture. I decreased the chili powder to one teaspoon. I am never fond of a lot of chili powder, so adjust to your own tastes. Next time I would add some salsa to the bean mixture. We did use the salsa on top as suggested, but next time we will also mix some in with the beans. Maybe about a cup or so. Even my meat loving husband ate some and enjoyed it. I had made him his own dinner, but he tried and liked this dish.

How disappointing!  I can't believe this recipe has so many 5 stars.  It was bland and heavy.  The only thing good about this recipe was that is gave me some ideas about how to make my own.

overall, it's a good dish.  not great. definitely needs the sour cream and salsa.  the beans were a good substitute for beef/chicken, for a change.  because of all the tortillas, it was a heavy dish.  i'd make it again sometime ..... in the distant future.  this recipe made enough for 4 people.

Soooo good! I made this for my boyfriend and I, and the leftovers were gone the next day. I loved how all the ingredients stayed together even after you cut a slice of the pie. It looked like it took a long time to prepare, but it was really quick!

This was a very satisfying and tasty tortilla
pie.  Since it uses many ingredients that
most vegetarians already would have on hand,
it's also convenient.

My family went nuts over this dish!  It was great the first night, and leftovers were even better the next day.  I only made a couple of changes: after reading that someone else thought it was too dry, I drained both cans of beans and reserved the liquid.  Then, when I out it in the oven, I poured some of the bean juice over the top, just before adding the last layer of cheese.  Came out deliciously gooey on the bottom.  I also used 2 large jalapenos instead of 1 jalapeno and one green pepper.  I seeded one and left the seeds in the other.  Gave it a very subtle kick, but noticeable.  We served it as recommended with fresh salsa and sour cream, and also used sliced avocado as a topping.  Definitely a keeper.

This bean pie is off the charts.  Get it?  Pie charts?!?!?!!  The end result of this recipe is better than pi.  It's super delicious and packed with protein.  We loaded ours with salsa, sour cream, and guacamole on top and the leftovers were quickly consumed.

Yum! This was the break from tacos that we needed. We added a layer of salsa on top for moisture, and that worked really well. A little sour cream and fresh cilantro on top pulls the dish together.

This recipe is superb! I doubled the number of beans and used white flour tortillas instead of the whole wheat. However, it can be a little dry. But the sour cream takes care of the dryness. Thank you for the recipe!

Based on reviews saying this was good with modifications (said it was too dry and bland as written), I made some changes the first time and LOVED IT! Thanks Adele21 for a great veggie recipe! My changes: added one entire jar of medium/hot salsa, garlic powder (would use cloves, but was out), a pinch of salt, whole jalapeño and some of the seeds to the ingredients in the saucepan. Onion would be good to add too. I used a whole can of white shoepeg corn (I prefer more + sweet corn) and vegetarian refried beans. I baked it in a 9 x 13 glass baking dish instead, which made 8 generous servings. I used 8 (10 inch) tortillas, so this made for 3 layers of filling with the last layer tortillas. When laying them out, I tore the center edges a bit to create less overlap in the middle. I let the ends curl up sides of pan, which helped it keep shape later. I used a little over a bag of shredded Mexican cheese mix to make this bigger size. I did the 10 minutes in a big wok style pan, and I think this helps the green pepper cook a little. I also baked for 25-30 minutes. This had great flavor on its own or with some added sour cream garnish.

Very tasty! I added cilantro, onions and mushrooms - left out the jalapeno b/c i didn't have one. I can see where it would be a little dry, it almost seems that the 10 minutes of stove top is unnecessary. It is easy and quick and adaptable so enjoy!

My 11 year old daughter has become a vegetarian, but is picky about what she would like to eat.  She made this recipe herself - substituted kidney beans for pintos and left out the olives - and she made two 3-torilla pies instead of one 5-tortilla pie.  we all LOVED this recipe and found it very flavorful (we added more chili powder and cumin to the recipe, which did the trick).  will make it again!

I just wanted to warn people out there who may be as unsuspecting as I was:  wear gloves while seeding the jalapeno!  I was in intolerable agony for 3 hours because I seeded the jalapeno with my fingers.  Fortunately I only got it on my fingers.  I tried milk, sour cream, oil, alcohol, coffee grounds, vinegar, etc.  I washed it off with dish soap.  It just kept on burning...So USE GLOVES.  The dish is good, it's hard for me to assess because I was thinking about the pain rather than the food, I would just leave the seeds in next time, and still use gloves.

Great idea, and really tasty recipe. I like to save time when I can, so I simply spiced the bean mixture with our store brand's Mexican Seasoning blend and the jalapeno. I used a Mexican blend of shredded cheeses instead of cheddar, and the dish turned out delish!

We really liked this meal.  I gave it a five because it is a good base recipe to work off of.  If you want it to be more interesting, make your layers more interesting.  Mine were as follows.  1st layer, bean mix topped with nacho jalepenos.  2nd layer, sour cream and salsa.  3rd layer, bean mix.  4th layer, fresh salsa puree (tomato, onion, cilantro, garlic, salt in food processor).  Final top layer, cheese and olives.  Baked 30 mins.  Only used black beans and refried beans.  Added a little tomato juice to thin out mix.  Topped with lettuce and guacamole.  Yum!  A great quick and easy meal.

For my tastes, this recipe was pretty bland. I did give it a second chance and this time I added another 1/2 Tbls. chili powder, a chopped onion, and, as another review suggested, layered salsa in the pie. It was much better, but still not too flavorful. I probably won't make it again, but it is good for people who like mild food or for young children.

After reading the reviews when I made this I mixed Newman's Own Black Bean & Corn salsa in with beans and all. It turned out 
Great.

We loved this!  Even the meat eating members of the family agreed it was delicious.  I didn't have any black beans so just used pinto and refried and did not mix the refried beans into the mixture, instead I divided about 1/3 of the cumin and chili powder and mixed in with the refried and then spread it over the tortilla layer, then put the other ingredients on. I also sauteed some onion and garlic with the green peppers in a pan before adding in the rest of ingredients.  I ended up only using three layers of tortillas and more cheese and baked twice as long, it was amazing!

This recipe didn't do much for me.  I added extra spices as recommended, but it still wasn't anything worth repeating for us.

I really liked this. I used a can of green chiles instead of jalapeno and I added salsa to each layer. I thought the amount of spice was just right.  My husband thought it was ok.

Yummy! I took the advice of other reviewers (who said it was a little dry) and added salsa to each layer.  My boyfriend and I found the end result to be just right.  I also ended up having quite a bit of bean mixture left (it wouldn't all fit in my pan), so I just wrapped the leftovers in tortillas to make burritos, which I then took for lunch.

I added a can of tomatoes with jalapenos and used medium salsa for the right amount of kick.  I didn't have any olives or corn, but will try next time.  My springform pan created a beautiful pie.

Delicious!  I, too, as some as the others did, substituted diced green chiles instead of the jalapeno.  I also omitted the green pepper and added 1 12 oz. can of Mexicorn which has peppers and onions in it.  Added more cheese as that's what the kids like!  Will definitely make again.  Thank you!

I thought I would really like this, and that it would be a great meatless alternative, but I wasn't that impressed. I've had similar recipes that were better. Perhaps I would have preferred it with green chiles instead of jalpenos. My husband liked it fine, but I haven't made it again.

You could probably assemble this dish in your sleep, which is a big plus. The flavors were alright and it was filling and inexpensive...but I thought the spices could use some doctoring-up (pretty cumin-heavy and just not as complex as I would have liked). It would probably work well to go with the earlier reviewer's suggestion for using taco seasoning. I'd also bake it for less than 20 minutes next time so that the top tortilla & cheese doesn't get crusty, but stays soft & gooey. The addition of salsa in the filling mix would also give it the moistness that it lacks.

I threw this together in about 10 minutes and it was great!  I only used one kind of beans becasue that's all I had, and I put the salsa in with the beans and corn like someone else had suggested.  Very tasty and reheats well.  Thanks for the recipe!!

For me, this recipe makes two "pies."  I use only three tortillas per pie.  I add green olives, jalapenos, sour cream -- whatever I'm in the mood for.  It's delicious, different, and makes an extra one to freeze.  One of my all-time favorites!

I thought this was pretty good but my husband hated it.  I added a whole can of corn and not the peppers (hubby doesn't like them).  Next time I would substitute the kidney beans for some mexican rice.  That would be a lot better I think.  Make sure you really like beans before you make this recipe.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! My husband and I don't have fancy tastes and were looking for more vegetarian recipes to incorporate into our diet. This one is pretty quick, uses common ingredients, and you don't miss the meat at all. I used an 8x8 glass pan instead of a round pie dish and it worked just fine for me. I even recommended this dish to my mother-in-law!

I thought this recipe was delicious.  I realized I didn't have the right spices so I used a 5 spice blend and 5 drops of tabasco sauce- worked well. I also made my own tortillas.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was very easy and very good.  "Like burritos in a pile" as my friend puts it. The top tortilla dried out quite a bit in the oven, so I just threw it away.  It made wonderful leftovers!  Next time I will use canned jalepenos to eliminate the chopping.

This was awesome!!! Because I HAD to become vegetarian (meat allergies), this recipe was great and gave me the protein that I needed. My husband who's not into 'vegetarianism' even thought this dish was great! My twelve year old son loved it, too... even though my two wee ones weren't too fond of it, it is still a great dish!

Very good!  I did, however, make a change in that I   used a package of taco seasoning instead of spices listed.  This recipe will stay in my favorites!

I made this without the olives, bell pepper and jalapeno pepper because I didn't have them on hand and don't really like them anyway.  I also used frozen corn instead of canned corn.  It was delicious and had my meat-eating husband raving about what a good meal it was.

This was a great dish, I will defintely be making it again! I made a couple alterations though, I sauted some onion and garlic before adding the other ingredients. I also added can of diced tomatoes with chiles and some cayenne to spice it up a little more and used frozen corn instead of the canned.

Fantastic!  I prepared this for a family dinner with a couple vegetarians in attendance.  We planned to have mexican, but having vegetarians we were concerned what to make for them to enjoy.  This went over very well.  Not only did the veggies like it, everyone else really enjoyed it too.

This was really good and easy.  I only had 3 whole wheat tortillas, so I substituted corn tortillas for the top 2 layers (3 of the small ones make one layer).  I forgot the refried beans at the store, but the other two cans were plenty.  I also added half a can of tomato paste, just b/c I had it, and that was good for flavor and consistency.   The cheese sort of hardens on top instead of melting...but it was still good!

Yum. I made stuck to the recipe for this one, and it turned out pretty good. I did have to trim my tortillas to fit in the pan, and my pan was also a bit too shallow so it was a little higher than the dish, but it worked out. Served with sour cream and salsa. It simply tastes like a bean burrito.

Wow this was great!  I did add some chicken sausage with spinach and asagio cheese that was leftover in the fridge.  A little too spicy for little kids but the grown-ups loved it!

I served this at a potluck, and people generally liked it but I thought it was bland even though I doubled the amount of spices and pepper.  I will try this again with variation in spices.

Great recipe! I replaced the green pepper with onion (just because we don't like bell peppers)and used corn tortillas. The spices are great!

This was really delicious and quick to make. Only problem was it made two pan-fulls and we are horrible when it comes to remembering to eat leftovers. It was very sad when I had to throw out the old leftovers.

Excellent - I've made this for company and they're always happy.  Sometimes I add veggie ground round.  I find that I can add another couple of cans of beans and make two pies.  I'll freeze one and have it the next week.

We loved it.  I substituted red onion for the bell pepper, added 3 cloves of garlic and sbstituted 1 T of pickled jalapinos for the fresh one.   I used 1 cup of frozen corn instead of the canned.   I added about a cup of tomallita salsa to the fry pan, used more cheese than called for and used only 4 tortillas in a 10 inch spring form pan.  I baked it 25 minutes.  It was just the right amount of spiciness  and very delicious.  Definitely will make this again.

Oh man, this was killer! I skipped the olives (don't care for them), and added some diced red onion. I used the whole can of corn and the whole green pepper, and I baked it in my cast iron skillet. We both went back for seconds. (Don't do that, by the way! This pie is so filling. I wish I'd stopped at one piece!)

Used 2 kinda bean ( red kidney and black bean ), used a potato masher to smash 1/8 of black beans to thicken. Using chili (with beef and pork meats) as base with beans. Let them outside of cake pan to cool, so pizza cutter will work. Friends happy!
