This is the best cake.  It is supposed to be slightly unbaked in the center- it is similar to a lava cake.  I have made this recipe multiple times and my guests have always loved it.  If you don't like chocolate- sorry, this is not the recipe for you.  And, you must understand that it is meant to be "raw" on the inside- that is the point of cooking it EXACTLY the time it states.

Absolutely delicious. I searched years ago for a molten chocolate cake recipe after having it. This was the first one I found and the only one I have used. You can make it and keep in freezer and thaw in fridge when ready to use.

even after 7 minutes, the flour was still not cooked and the cake had a raw taste to it. and even when it was cooked thoroughly, it was not in the least bit decadent! 
ill never bake it again and what a waste of fine ingredients!

Fantastic!!!!!  I made half the recipe and cooked up 4 muffin cups. Still lots left over for tomorrow.  Hopefully it will still be ok. There are only 2 of us and two each was our limit.  We had it with ice cream.  Will definitely make again for friends

It was difficult to mix in the eggs without them cooking.  If you like dark chocolate you'll love these.  I like milk chocolate.

I tried several molten cake recipes, this is the first one that comes up exactly as I wanted it. Loved it! Thank you! I'd only suggest to use baking cups since it is still very liquid by the time you pull them out of the oven. You need to be very careful not to break the top when pulling them out.
