I made this for BOTH Thanksgiving & Christmas.  I ate ALL of it!!  And you know what is sad?  I HATE sweet potatoes...always have.  This dish will be at EVERY holiday gathering now and some in between.  On the 2nd batch I decided to try marshmellow cream instead of melting marshmellows...BIG MISTAKE!  Take the time & melt them.  The taste is so much better but either way I ate way more then I should have. This is a MUST TRY for ALL sweet potato haters.  Awesome!

Well I did not think this was ever going to make it up on this website. I originally put it up before the 2000 holiday and I only found it because I lost my own recipe and figured to try and look on this website to see if they finally posted it! Im glad my aunt, who I know now is the creator of this pie(sorry aunt phyllis) wrote a review of this. I miss everyone a lot and I am in good health. I guess this should be called Aunt Phyllis' Sweet Potato Pie, I cannot wait to make it again!

I followed the directions for the recipe to the letter and it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  Plus the amount of filling listed actually ended up making enough for two pies.  I just dont think sweet potato and graham craker crust go that well together.

I am a brand new "cook" if you will at age 36, and decided to try this recipe out on Thanksgiving.   I live in AZ but was born & bred in Philly, so I saw the use of Philly Cream Cheese & decided to give this a try.

A+ for sure, 5 stars, it was gone in about 5 minutes, that I had to go to the store on black friday to buy more to make for my husband!

I increased the sugar to 3/4 c because I'm not sure that this dish was intended to be a dessert.  I added 1 t cinnamon and 2T whisky.  1.5 T vanilla was enough.  I put it through my food processor to make it smoother.  Crust:  I needed a few T more butter for the crust.  I added 1/2 c finely chopped pecans to the crust.  I wasn't sure it if was supposed to go up the sides but I did get it up the sides about an inch.  When the pie was done, I added the marshmallows and put the broiler on to very lightly brown the marshmallows, then chilled it.  I called it sweet potato cheesecake.  Even the kids liked it (the marshmallows helped).

Not too bad.  I left off the marshmallows since I made it the night before our church lunch. Just before I served it I spread some sweetened sour cream on the top. The crust was not my favorite part and I will change that next time to a regular pie crust. Again, I made the filling in my food processor to get a smooth texture. I went to three stores to find light cream but no luck so I used half and half and it turned out really rich.  My girls decided though that it was more like Sweet Potato Cheesecake than pie.  Was it a hit at church?  Well, about 100 people ate and my pie was the first desert gone and I shared the recipe with almost all of the ladies there. So yeah, it was good.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family is crazy over it. The only reason I didn't give it a five is because it makes way too much filling. Even my husband, who won't come within ten feet of cream cheese loved it.  I'll be making it again for Christmas, but I'll use a pre-made graham cracker crust to save time.

I haven't yet made the recipe, but I've copied it it and printed it to take to my daughter's for our Christmas festivities!

This was my first attempt at a sweet potato pie - eating it or making it, and it was worth the effort!  Very good.  It did make enough for 2 pies, so I froze half of the batter for anther time.

This recipe absolutely deserves more than 5 stars!  I wish I could vote for more than 10 stars, this recipe is out of this world and not because I am a food lover but because this sweet potato pie recipe kills the one I thought I was making that everyone loved.  The graham cracker and marshmallows are definitely an added treat.  After I made this one year ago, it has been requested every month and we will be big as cows if I fulfill every request.  This is my boyfriend's favorite dessert and I thank you for sharing.  WE LOVE IT!!!! It is devine!!!!!!

This recipe is awesome. I have been making it for the past six years and every year somebody always asks me for the recipe. My only alteration is I use premade grahm cracker pie crust

I have never liked sweet potatoes. But I was bound and determined to find a way to fix them so that my kids would at least try them. This is the recipe for that! Now, I like sweet potatoes too! But they have to be in pie form! I did use a premade crust, because I cannot make a graham cracker crust that holds together, but it was the filling that was the star at Thanksgiving dinner.

I made this today for a trial run for Thanksgiving. It was good, but I agree with some of the others, it could use a little more sugar, and a touch of cinnamon.  Im going to make another one this weekend, with some tweaks. we'll see if it's better, or if I ruin a great recipe!

I have made this recipe for the last ten years.  I like to add extra butter to the crust, extra sugar to the sweet potato mix, and bake it in a 9x13 dish.  I lost the recipe for last years casserole and it was not as good.  Fortunately, I found it here!   It's a family favorite requested dish by both sides of our family. Thank you so much for sharing it!

I made this today and followed the recipe almost exactly. The only change was that I used heavy cream instead of light because that’s all I had. It turned out great. My brother ate the first piece and said it was maybe the best pie he’s ever had.

Made this a few years ago along with homemade pumpkin pie. My husband liked this better than the pumpkin!! I had never tried sweet potato pie before making this, just the thought used to gross me out. I will be making this again this Thanksgiving and perhaps save the pumpkin cheesecake for Christmas. Love this!!

Super moist!  I used Lactaid skim milk pulsated to a light cream vs. the cream cheese/light cream the recipe calls for.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter to give it that fall flavor.  The pie itself it not too sweet, so I opted for the large marshmallows instead of the mini ones.  What I ended up getting was marshmallow with a side of pie, so DO NOT SUBSTITUTE the marshmallows.  This pie was still gone in about 15 minutes, so it wasn't a complete fail, but I will be sure to stick closer to the recipe for the next go 'round.  Definitely worth a try for Thanksgiving!

My entire family is sweet potato enthusiasts. My grandmother who is no longer with us "made the very best"; however, I cannot believe the very words out of my own mother's mouth when I made this recipe... yep "this is the best I've ever had!" (This was even after telling me that NO ONE CAN MAKE IT BETTER THAN GRANDMA! PERIOD!)
I rarely ever follow a recipe exactly and I cant say I did here BUT I did follow the ingredients and added minimally based on taste. My mother swears by it and so do I so I'll write down exactly what measurements I use this time Thanksgiving and share... THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE AUNT PHYLLIS and JEREMY :)
