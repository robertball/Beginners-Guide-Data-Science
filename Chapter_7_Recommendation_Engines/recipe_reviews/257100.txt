2.17.17   Followed the recipe and was quite happy with the way this turned out.  I did add just a little bit of sugar to tame the acidity and a little garlic powder, but other that, wouldn’t change a thing.  Made one small pizza for a late Friday lunch, and the rest of the sauce went into the freezer.  Making homemade pizza sauce is so economical, and this is not only easy, it's a good recipe!

This was oh so good! The only thing I did differently was I added garlic. I’ll definitely make it again
