This is the only way I've ever had squash but you can do it a quicker way.  Cut it in half and seed it.  Microwave on high for 5 minutes.  Put about a tablespoon of butter in each have and spread it around on the top edges and inside.  Litely sprinkle nutmeg all over and then about twice as much cinnamon.  Follow it up with brown sugar (1-2T each half depending on how sweet you like it) and bake at 350 for about 20 minutes.  Feel free to turn the oven off and keep the squash in there until the rest of your meal is done.  You just can't miss with squash this way!

This is a great recipe. I love the butter and brown suagr flavor, but I cook mine differently. I use the same amount and same ingredients, but I cut the acorn squash in half, place flesh side up and place into a casserole dish or a roasting pan with a little water. I put the butter and brown sugar in the middle before I cook it. Then I cook in a 350 degree oven for 45-60 mins. Comes out perfect every time. If the squah is a little unstable, I cut the bottom just a little to make it stand up better. I'll do about 2 squash at a time (4 servings).

You can make this same recipe in the microwave.  Just place squash halves cut side down in a microwave tray with 1/2 cup water per two halves.  Cook 10-15 min until tender.  Then turn over and fill with butter and sugar.  Cook until butter melts.

Basically a good recipe with an insufficient method. To get the flavor into the squash, you have to cut through the flesh with a knife in a criss-cross pattern to allow entry to the butter and sugar. Also, DO NOT replace the top half onto the bottom half for baking. That's crazy! That top half will get no flavor! Bake all halves flesh facing up with their own portion of butter and sugar.

Very good, but excellent after adding an equal amount of salt to the sugar. (If you like Kettle Corn, you'll love this.  It's not too sweet this way.) Also, since I HATE having to cut these darn things in half, I just bake them whole for about an hour at 375. Then they can be cut in half with a butter knife! I then broil for 5 minutes to melt the butter/sugar/salt mix.

I have always loved acorn squash and have always prepared it the same way, year after year, baked, with butter, salt and pepper, garlic powder and a little paprika for color. Never bothered to do it any other way, mostly because I'm just not a fan of mixing sweet with savory. This year however, I thought I'd like to try something different, and was willing to try the sugar on squash concept. So, other than putting a little water in the pan during the first half hour, I made this exactly as written and... I'm a convert!  Loved it, as did everyone else at the Thanksgiving table. The combination of brown sugar and butter baked to create almost a caramely glaze which was just pleasantly sweet. Simply delicious!

Much faster if done in the microwave. depending upon size of sqaush should only take about 8 to 12 minutes. Place face up add your butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon cover with paper towel, micro on high.

even better when you add cinnamon to it.

FANTASTIC! what a beautiful roasted flavor the acorn squash has with this simple and delectable brown sugar glaze. I stuffed the acorn squash with some cous-cous and served it with chicken - a perfect meal.

This was fantastic!  My husband who is not crazy about squash and my 2 year old who is not crazy about anything nutritious both loved it.  It really couldn't be easier.  This is going to be a regular on our menu!

I make this the same way.  Just wanted to add a time saving tip.  Using the whole squash, I pierce the skin of my acorn squash several times and then place it in the microwave.  Cooking time depends on the size of the squash, but I usually start with 5 minutes and then check it, adding 2 minutes at a time as necessary.  When the squash is soft to the touch, take it out and then halve and seed it, add brown sugar and butter and proceed.  I figured this out one night when I needed to speed up dinner unexpectedly.  Hope this helps!

So yummy.  I decided to make this more of a meal, so I did the following:  sauteed 1/4c pecans, 1/4c chopped peeled apple, and 1/8c diced celery in a teaspoon of butter (I use Becel - heart-healthy alternative) for three or four minutes on medium-high heat, then added about 1/2c cooked couscous.  Stirred it all together, scooped it into the squash (after baking for 60 minutes total), then put it back it for another five minutes.  Just before serving, I drizzled a bit of (real) maple syrup over the top.  Even my husband who doesn't really like squash said it was really good.  Pair with a small salad for a healthy meal.

My acorn squash was fairly big and cutting in half seemed dangerous - so I microwaved it 2-1/2 minutes on high.  MUCH easier to cut in half!!!

This is a fall staple in our home. I spray the baking dish with PAM and bake it cooked side down for first 45 minutes. I then turn it cut side up prick the flesh, being careful not to go through the skin, and put butter, brown sugar and cinnamon in the cavity for husband and daughter. I prefer it with just butter and salt and pepper. This dish works well for personal preferences.

My husband thought it smelled great, then he wrinkled up his nose when I told him it was squash! But he liked it so much, he ate every bit!

I took bits and pieces of everone elses modifications. Here's what I came up with:

INGREDIENTS (all are approximate):
5 little squash, halved and seeded 
dash salt
1 tablespoon melted butter 
2 tablespoons brown sugar 
3 dashes cinnamon
3 Tablespoons water 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DIRECTIONS:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
Turn squash upside down onto a baking dish. Put water in baking dish and cover. Bake in a 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven until it begins to soften, approximately 30 minutes. 
Remove squash from the oven and turn over so that the flesh is facing upwards. (***See below for direction to insert here to make it a little more fun :)  Tilt (prop with an extra hot pad) the dish up on its’ side and use a paper towel to sop up the excess water.  Sprinkle Salt (minimal amount), cinnamon, and brown sugar over the squash, dribble the butter over. Place squash in the 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven and bake another 15-20 minutes.

***For a little more fun:

Mix:
1 apple, cored, slice it thin and then cut those pieces to range ½ cm to 2 cm
the cinnamon previously mentioned
1 dash nutmeg
¼ cup walnuts—very coarsely chopped
1 Tablespoon brown sugar.

Spoon onto squash, focusing on filling the hollowed middles.

This is WAY better than I thought it would be. WOW! I made minor adjustments...baked in microwave for 8 minutes then added 1 tbs. each half of "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" and 1 tbs. of brown sugar then baked for 20 minutes at 350. Heavenly! Going to buy more squash on my next store visit.

Made this with our roasted chicken last night and it was loved by all. To cut down on time, I put about a half inch of water into a casserole dish, put both halves of the squash flesh side down and microwaved for about fifteen minutes. I then switched over to the oven to finish it off. Wonderful Terry and thanks!

i added sliced fresh apples half way through, and sprinkled a little cinnamon with the brown sugar. Mmm... the smell of baked apples... I also was just cooking for myself tonight, so i froze half the uncooked squash and just made half. (with half the butter and brown sugar, of course!)

This was a great side though a very large portion for 2 people. I cut the halves into 2 and made it 4 servings. I wouldn't want to eat an entire half. After I baked them face down for 30 minutes I baked them upright with the butter & brown sugar so each side would be cooked evenly with the butter/sugar and it turned out great. It didn't make sense to me to bake them on top of each other because then the sauce wouldn't bake into the other half.

I haven't baked acorn squash in I don't know how long. I always puncture with fork in three or four places and bake it in the microwave until soft. It is so much easier to cut that way. After I cut it in half and remove the seeds I put the butter and brown sugar in each half and put it back in the microwave on a low setting so it melts together and carmelizing. Another hint is to look for an acorn squash that has a good amount of yellow on it because that means they are riper! (I like my squash a little drier and this provides for that effect.)

I followed another rater's advice and cooked the halved squash (flesh side up) in a roasting pan with a little water (uncovered - with the brown sugar/butter mixture inside the halved gems) for 60 minutes.  I added salt and pepper to the butter/sugar mixture and basted the squash about every 20 minutes.  I finished them under the broiler to carmelize the sugar.  Nutritious, and delicious.

YUM! That was delicious!  I read the comments that say microwaving is quicker. It most certainly is, but I bet the aroma is slightly different.  The roasting aromas produced in my beloved gas oven are just wonderful. I also added some salt, as suggested in one of the comments, and that balanced it out perfectly.

I have made acorn squash for many years, but you are missing a major ingredient!  GARLIC!  May sound odd, but add a tablespoon of crushed garlic to the butter and brown sugar before baking.  YUMMMMM!

This is a winter-time staple for us - everyone in the family loves it, even my non-squash loving hubby :)  Thank you to ALEXSMOMI for the wonderful suggestion on microwaving to soften the squash - saves so much time!!! We also add in pecans or walnuts if I have them on hand, the kiddos love this best with nuts :)

This is an easy way to serve acorn squash. I've always made it this way, although I don't put the two halves together after adding the butter and sugar. I also use less sugar and butter - about 1 teaspoon sugar and 1/4 teaspoon butter per half. That's pretty much a taste thing so the quantites can be increased or decreased as you like. As a variation, substitute maple syrup or honey for brown sugar. For serving - see what your family likes. One way is to stir up the flesh with the butter and sugar. Another way is to leave it as it comes out of the oven.

This was great and sooo easy.  I used a butternut squash and sprinkled the brown sugar over the top of it before putting them together to cook.  It turned out wonderful.

I baked them whole for about an hour at 375. Then cut in half with a knife & deseeded!  Then baked further for about 10-15 minutes with sugar & butter added.

My boyfriend introduced me to this squash almost 6 years ago and I know it may sound a little nutty, but if you bake Lil' Smokies inside of the squash with the butter and sugar....it is crazy good!  Everyone that he has made this for just LOVES it.  I suppose you could use summer sausage or kielbasa for similar results.

This is a very good recipe except for I like a little more sauce on mine so I doubled the Butter and Brown Sugar. they were excellent. I also recommend that you use a glass baking dish because the cookie sheet doesn't like the steam created from the squash and it tends to miss shape your cookie sheet.

The ONLY way I like squash! I don't quite see the point of reassembling the squash pieces on top of each other though. It turns out better if you just put the butter and brown sugar in the center of each piece and leave both cut side up to continue baking. The butter and brown sugar caramelize more that way!

Delicious and so easy. I don't even like yellow squash. Cooking time is long, but preperation is shorter than almost anything prepared fresh. This recipe goes with just about anything and will suit everyone's taste. Even with the butter and sugar, this dish is realy low calorie.  You'd never know it by the taste. I add nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt (kosher preferably.) It's perfect reheated also.

Just like my mom used to make for me when I was growing up! I completely forgot I even liked this, but it's a great way to get more veggies, cause I eat it as a dessert. Even my picky eater husband liked it :) I pricked the squash innerds with a fork to get the buttery, sugary flavor to soak in better, it helps a lot.

Very good! I did add some cinnamon, and microwaved for 5 minutes before roasting. I would roast for the whole time if it were winter, if only in an effort to help heat this apartment up; however, it's been in the upper 90's here, and 20 minutes of 350 degrees was quite enough.

Soooo good! I can't believe I've waiting so long to try this recipe, its fantastic and almost too easy.  I'm thinking next time I'll add some cinnamon, nutmeg, or even some red chili powder for a sweet/savory side...lots of options w/this one.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made acorn squash like this for years however I also add some fresh grated nutmeg, cinnamon, a splash of sweet sherry ,salt and pepper and butter. I pierce the flesh with a fork to let the melted butter, sherry and other ingredients soak into the flesh. I bake the two open halves side up so the flesh browns just a tad.  When it is cooked I fork mash it all together to blend the flavors. Over the top good!

Try substituting the brown sugar with maple syrup for a change. I usually put in a dab of butter and add about a tablespoon of real maple syrup or more. I also use a brush to cover the cut edges. So good but not overly sweet.

This is the way I always cook my acorn squash. It's easy and yummy! Two tips...1. Use pourable brown sugar (easier to sprinkle evenly) and 2. cut a small piece off the bottom of each half to keep them from tipping over or sliding around in the pan. Enjoy!

These came out great! I only used a little brown sugar and I didn't use the butter because I'm watching my calorie intake. It was sweet even before I topped with brown sugar. I also used a baking sheet lined with foil for the whole thing and clean up was a snap!

I did the first bit of cooking in the microwave, face down with some water.  Then flipped them over, added a tablespoon on Smart Balance, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar (ended up using about a teaspoon of brown sugar per half, spread out).  Baked at 350 degrees for 25 mins.  The five year old smelled the cinnamon and came running.  He ate a half all by himself.  It was delicious.

this was easy and good-but putting the two halves on top of each other at the end made a big mess and left one half less tasty than the other-I wonder if it would work just as well just leaving them open side up?

This is good, but I like to add some nutmeg and cinnamon to mine. Another good way is to bake them with just cranberry sauce in them.

How can you go wrong with butter and sugar?  We all love the roasted flavor of the squash and it comes out perfectly every time.  My only addition is sprinkling a bit more brown sugar on the exposed edge of the squash and broiling it for the last couple of minutes.  Also, if you have a grapefruit spoon or knife, the serrated, curved edge really helps to get the seeds and strings out of the center for almost any kind of squash.  Yummy  :)

This is the first time I have had acorn squash.  It is wonderful!  I baked both halves flesh side up, filled with butter and brown sugar, and covered it with foil for 1 hour.  ***In an effort to cut calories, I now use 1 T. Brummel and Brown and 1 T. Splenda Brown Sugar. 1 1/2 PointsPlus

I made this for my family. Except for the rather long cooking time, it is just as easy as making that horrible frozen kind of squash in the foil pachage and was worlds better. Thanks for a great recipe.

This squash was great, and I'm not a big squash fan. I agree with several reviews about the handling. Nuke it for 2-3 minutes to make it easier to cut. I also did not cover the bottom half with the top half as suggested, otherwise only one side would have all the flavor. But do keep in mind that if you cut it around the center (versus top to bottom) the top half of the squash is thicker and takes longer to cook. The first time I made it, the bottom half was perfect but the top half was underdone. Second time I made it, I put the top half in 12 minutes earlier than the bottom and it all came out perfectly. I also scored mine (cross hatches with a knife in the flesh) to let the flavors sink in, before adding the butter and sugar...and a pinch of salt, which does add a great flavor. Made this for my Dad and he scraped every last bite down to the skin. Microwaved leftovers 2 days later and still fantastic. Will make again! By the way, look for the recipe for toasting winter squash seeds on this site too. At least as good as pumpkin seeds and such a shame to throw them out!

I found this recipe last fall & already have an acorn squash to make it again this year.  Acorn squash is very difficult to cut through.  Microwave it for a few minutes and then it slices easily.  Other reviews suggest cooking entirely in the microwave, but I prefer roasting it in the oven.  It smells so good while it's cooking.  Also, since I'm from the south I use way more butter & a little extra brown sugar.  I haven't tried this with molasses but I'm sure that would be good too. This is very good served with ham.  Great fall recipe!!

This is delicious but better if you cut in half then cut a touch off the bottoms so they sit flat and then bake them all face up the 2nd half with the butter and sugar.  I use a rimmed cookie sheet.  Cinammon and nutmeg sprinkled on top is good and looks pretty. My husband doesn't like it sweet so his is butter only.  My whole family enjoys this.

The butter and sugar barely seasoned the exposed layer of squash and didn't even touch all the meat beneath. Plus cutting a raw squash was next to impossible. Next time, I'll try cooking the squash whole, then slicing it and seasoning each slice (with cinnamon too) to make sure I'm not eating so much plain squash.

This was my first time cooking squash.  I followed the directions but the squash didn't cook all the way through.  Also, I thought the brown sugar & butter mixture made the squash too sweet for my taste, but I think that is personal preference.  My husband didn't like it at all.  I will stick to more savory uses for this vegetable in the future.

Great recipe, I enjoyed it very much but I did another version the next time. Instead of butter I added orange juice a pinch of cinnamon and brown sugar, delicious and healthier:)

Great! I made it using others' suggestions to microwave it first.  So I did that for 4 minutes, then put it in the oven for 25 mins.  I forgot to put the brown sugar, but it was still sweet and yummy.  Thank you!

If you want a different taste, try maple syrup instead. Make sure you use real maple syrup and not pancake syrup. Add a little kosher salt and pepper to it. Also, I do not put the squash in the microwave. I just scoop out the seeds add everything and just bake it as is. My family loves it and so does company.

Exactly the recipe I use. BUT, I poke the skin of the squash with a fork in a few places, then microwave it on high for about 5-6 mins. then I slice it into thick slices.  Spread them on a cookie sheet lined w/ foil and then add cin., brown sugar,dash of nutmeg and butter then bake as recipe says. 350* for about an hour or til tender with a poke of a fork. SCRUMPTIOUS!! (check after 30 to 40 mins to not over cook!)

The squash was cooked to a perfect firmness but the butter and sugar mixture was infused only in the bottom portion which flavored it but left most of the squash pretty bland.

Very good, but if your in a rush definitely place the squash in the microwave to cook, still tastes wonderful, but in half the time that the oven would take.

This recipe was pretty good. It was kind of hard to eat though... when we took it out of the oven it was really hard to handle and was hot and sticky. It tasted pretty good though.

This was a tasty way to try a new fall vegetable.  Probably something I would only have once or twice a season, but I'm glad I tried it (and my husband even ate it, who is a picky veggie eater).  Here are the changes I made based on other reviews/recipes:  Added about 1/4 cup of water to the bottom of a glass pan (select a pan that is a nice fit for your acorn), cut the acorn in half and then cut off a small piece of the bottom so they would sit level.  Filled their cavities with the recommended butter and brown sugar, but then also added a few dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon.  Cooked them open faced in the oven for 45 minutes.  When I pulled them out, I sprinkled chopped pecans inside.  In case you've never tried these before - the idea then is to use a spoon to mix the veg. flesh with the sugar/butter mixture.

Cook flesh-side up... but one more thing.  Makes a huge difference. Bacon.  Yep. Put a piece or two of uncooked bacon in there and you're in heaven.

I cut down the butter and sugar by 1/3 to save some calories, and it turned out yummy! I think with more sugar and butter it might have been too sweet. Will definitely add this to my fall/winter cooking rotation.

First time to eat acorn squash is this fashion, it was absolutely fantastic.  I suggest after cooking face down, and adding butter and brown sugar, cook the last 30 mins with faces open so each side gets well buttered and sugared.  I did that and it was phenominal.  Am looking forward to cooking this again.  Thanks for the great, simple recipe.

I LOVE THIS. This is the same directions you get at the store except store directions tells you to cook upside down at 400 degrees for 30 minutes then add sugar and butter and cook for another 15 minutes.  You must try.  Also try the same with other squashes.

Super simple yet so good!! The only things I will do differently next time is to slice into the squash's flesh a bit more to make sure the delicious topping gets all the way down and line my baking sheet with foil - just to save myself some elbow grease later ;-)

Very good, and easy to make.  Also started my squash in the microwave (halved squash - 8 minutes) to start the process, then finished in the oven with the butter and brown sugar.  I was serving these as a side dish, so I quartered the squash.  Half way through the cook time, I opened the oven to spread the butter/brown sugar mixture around the inside of the squash.  The non-veggie eaters didn't even attempt, but those who did try it liked it (including me).

This was my first time trying acorn squash and while it's something I'll have to get used to (texture thing), the taste was phenomenal (I know I spelled that wrong, but am rushing).  Thx so much for recipe!

I did not unterstand the instructions to put  the remaining squash over the other piece (one side would not have the goodies in it).  I left the squash right side up and divided the 2 tbs of brown sugar and 1 tbs butter between the two halves and left them on the cookie sheet.  It turned out very good.  The cooking time on the recipe was correct.

butter is not needed to get the desidered result here, it's just wasted calorie and fat...while I agee it can be microwaved, I prefer mine in the oven, i place the squash in pan with water 1/2 way up the side of the squash and the cavity  face up filled with brown sugar and cinnamon....although maple syrup is a good alternative as well...just fill it and forget it and let the amazing aroma take over the house, my son who is picky when it comes to vegetables will actually ask for this one, he loves it!!!!

My TWIST on this recipe...
I cook in the micro and place the 2 halves side-by-side in a Pyrex dish with a 1/4 inch of water, but I fill the cavities with brown sugar and then slowly fill with Soy sauce.  The sweet of the sugar and sour of the Soy makes a great sauce when you mix the squash into the liquid.
Micro them for about 10 mins on High.  Check for doneness and micro again if necessary.
Man Cooker of the house, Norm

Such an easy recipe and the results are yummy! I only needed to bake the squash for 30 minutes to start and then turned both halves flesh-side up for the second half of baking which took only 20 minutes. My 15 month old daughter absolutely loved it! Thank you for posting this recipe.

Purchased an Acorn Squash on a whim and we are glad we did! Looked at the suggestions below and opted to microwave for 8 minutes prior to baking.  Also added a sprinkle of sea salt in addition to the butter, nutmeg, cinnamon and brown sugar.  Such a treat!

I combine this recipe with the microwave ideas below and do step 2 in the microwave.  It usually is about 8 mins in the microwave and then I finish them in the oven.

Unbelievably delicious! Wow! So simple, three ingredients, my kind of recipe. Because I didn't slice the squash in half evenly (I've always sucked at the simplest of tasks), the top half fell off halfway through step 4. I just kept the two halves separate flesh-side facing up and it worked perfectly. Thank you!

I wonder if maybe I don't like acorn squash?  This was just ok for me, but I'll admit that I'm not usually a fan of sweet on my entrees/sides. I just wanted to try something new.  Thanks for sharing, but I probably won't make this again.  One bonus, though: I discovered that roasted acorn squash seeds are yummy :-)

This is the way I make my acorn squash. I always add a little cinnamon and sometimes I'll add either raisins or dried cranberries. I've even put a little maple syrup in it before. I always bake mine and never use the microwave. There's just something that lacks when you use a microwave. Hubby was very reluctant to try it, but he really likes it.

Could've cooked longer - squash was a bit stringy. Only the top layer retained the flavoring (butter, cinnamon, allspice). Also didn't realize how difficult it would be to cut a squash in half!

Great taste, although IMHO the filling was a tad too liquidy for my taste.  I wish there was a method to make it bake up crunchy.  I guess the fact that it's steaming in the oven makes that impossible.  Still, a great veggie side recipe that the kids will eat!

This is wonderful, I gave it four stars, but even better is how I cook it! I cut it the same, bake it with the hollowed inside portions facing down in 1/2 inch of water in a glass pan for about 25 minutes. Check it, turn the halves over coat them with brown sugar, add cubed apple pieces(I like a tart apple best), add a pat of butter and drizzle with maple syrup or agave syrup for a healthier option....soooo yummy!

I have been making Acorn sqush like this for years. One thing that I have found helpful is to slice off a little bit of the rind, on the bottom to keep it from rolling/sliding on the cookie sheet. Other wise I would not change a thing.
I read a review where someone said there was only flavor on the top layer. I finished baking the squash with the flesh side up to bake. Before topping with butter, score the flesh slightly on a diagonal/crisscrossing. This will allow the butter to get into the squash. Melt the butter before putting in the halves, stir brown sugar into butter and drizzle on squash. Halfway through baking, spoon liquid inside of squash and reapply to edges of squash. 
Before you bake the halves upside down, sprinkle with nutmeg, allspice (whatever you like) add some water to baking dish this will keep it moist and infuse some flavors into the flesh of the squash. Dump water before baking flesh side up. Hope this helps

I have been making acorn squash for years like this just for me since my significant other sticks his nose up to any vegetable. I have, however, not split the baking but willl do that today when I bake one for dinner. Acorn squash is also excellent plain which I sometimes do as I like cooking in the nude. Thank you for a reminder of a delicious and nutritious recipe.

This is a great basic recipe.  I didn't put the two halves together, instead left them both facing up and covered with foil for final baking.   For color contrast and flavor I added dried cranberries to the butter/brown sugar mixture, it was soooo good!

This squash was very tasty.  My hubby loved it.  I made it as written and my only problem was I had cooked it for 30 mins covered and 30 mins uncovered and it still was not done.  It was not a large acorn squash, so not sure what I did wrong.  I had to cook an additional 15 mins plus.

I followed the reviewers' recommendations and cooked it differently.  I baked it halved with the ingredients already in it at 350 degrees for an hour total. 30 minutes with foil covering it and 30 minutes without.  Delicious!

I have never tried acorn squash before and am so glad I did. This recipe is so good. I have a real sweet tooth and this really does taste like dessert. I'm on Jenny Craig rigt now and this was guilt free!!! I did use PAM butter coking spray and waaay less butter, also used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend and it came out amazing!!! Will make again for sure. Don't hesitate this one is a keeper Try it today!!

Perfect for an everyday meal, yet always feels unique because we don't eat acorn squash every day! I love the suggestions for microwaving. Saves a lot of time with the same result! One modification - I add a sprinkling of rosemary to the butter/brown sugar mixture. Gives a nice contrast to the sweetness. I always have dry rosemary on hand, but I bet fresh is even better.

I hadn't tried squash in about 20 years so I thought it was about time I give it another try.  It was good!  I baked mine differently: placed, cut-side up, in a small baking dish with 1/2 inch of water in the bottom and covered it with foil.  It was perfectly baked after 60 minutes.  I had to salt the heck of it too.

My mom has been making this since I was a kid. The only thing she adds is a slice of bacon for each squash half. The salty-smokey flavor of the bacon gives a great kick to the super sweet dish. Trust me, if you don't mind eating meat it's a GREAT addition.

This was so good! First time we have had acorn squash but it won't be the last! I read the reviews and cut a lot of the steps out and just cooked them about 1 hour with the butter/sugar mixture. Added nutmeg/cinnamon and topped with pecons when done! Wonderful!! Thank you!

This is how we've cooked squash in my family for over 50 years, but we do add a tsp of vanilla along with the butter and brown sugar before we bake it.  Then when it is done, we sprinkle a dash of nutmeg over the squash.  It looks beautiful and tastes delicious!

Don't be afraid to try this in the microwave.  Place both halves in a shallow dish, cover tightly with saran wrap and microwave on high 6-8 minutes.  Turns out just fine without heating up the house.

I love this recipe! I took the advice of some other reviewers and tried using the microwave. I have to say that squash roasted in the oven tastes sooooo much better... I guess I like that slow roasted flavor the oven gives the squash, sort of carmelizes the sugars more I guess.

I start my acorn squash in the microwave, in a glass dish face down with a bit of water. I drain the water turn the squash and add Honey and a little maple extract. The maple flavoring is very tasty and doesn't use butter or oleo

My aunt makes this when I come to visit and I love it.  One difference is she adds pistachios (about 25) when she is ready to serve it and it is great.  The crunch they provide is a perfect balance to the mushiness of the squash.

I cook acorn squash in the microwave, too.  However, I just poke holes in it like you would a potato, then put it in the microwave for about 10 minutes.  Take it out, slice it in half, clean out the seeds (which come out easier after being cooked), add butter or margarine to each half, put each half in a small bowl so you don't have to 'chase' the squash around your plate, and enjoy with the rest of the meal.

This was very good. I used also added a pinch of cinnamon and ground cloves, it made my whole house smell really good. I used another reviewers advice and put the 2 halves in a casserole dish with a little water facing up and baked it at 350 for about 50 min.

Simple and delicious.  Especially good when started in the microwave for 5-10 minutes...frees up oven space when you have ten things going at once.  Also, if you have dark brown sugar lying around from that one cookie recipe that calls for it (and I know everyone has that one recipe, whatever it happens to be), this is a great way to use some of it.  Acorn squash appreciates a little extra molasses.

I never tried the original recipe so I cant rate that. But, with the modifications I made, it was fabulous (I'm sure its very good without the modifications too.)  Anyway, I added cinnamon and ground cloves to the brown sugar, and cooked the squash in the microwave.  I have also used differnt kids of squash like dumpling, carnival, and buttercup.  All have turned out great!

Ive tried this but it took so long, so I made some revisions. I cut  mine in half, scoop out the insides, and cook in the microwave for 10-20 minutes, depending on size. I usually scoop the insides out, stick it in a dish, mix in the butter and top with brown sugar and just a touch of maple syrup. Sometimes I add a little bit of chopped pecans to the top. Then I stick it under the broiler until brown. Much much faster!

This was my first time eating acorn squash and I didn't like the texture at all! It was very grainy, not consistent or smooth as I had expected. After halving the squash and seeding, I put it in the microwave for 20 minutes to cut down on the bake time. Afterwards, I put the butter and brown sugar in and popped it in the oven. It smelled fabulous, but I was disappointed with the lack of depth in the flavor and texture. Won't make again with acorn squash, but will try with other kinds.

I found doing this recipe was pretty well good the way it was. I only tweaked it a bit. I substituted dark maple syrup (its hard to find, usually at farmers markets or the rare road side stand). It was pretty good, plus I am sure someone else has said it but do NOT put the other half on top and for the love of god criss cross the squash after the initial backing before you at the sugar and butter

Agree with other reviewers ..been making this for years.  Add a little water to bottom of pan to keep moist and stop skin from burning...score the squash and add the butter, brown sugar right from the start..keep both sides face up in the pan....cook 45-60 min.  I also add nutmeg ..you could add cinnamon if you prefer that taste instead ..and I love the idea of adding walnuts ...mmmm!

Acorn squash is one of our family favorites! I add 1/4 of an apple that is chopped into bite size pieces. Put it in the middle of the halved squash, mix with cinnamon, butter and brown sugar. I cover the halves with plastic wrap or paper towels and microwave for about 10 mins. The apple makes it moist and yummy!

Very tasty and easy recipe. Using other reviewers recommendations I microwaved the cut, seeded squash cut side down in a tray with water for 7 min (time may vary based on squash size). Then I add the sugar and butter and bake at 350 for 20 min. The oven caramelizes the sugar and brings out a more complex flavor.My husband who didn't really like squash before loves this recipe. Thanks.

To make the squash sit flat, slice off a thin layer on the other side. This is one of my favorites and so easy!

Good and simple way to make squash, since I am on a low sodium diet I used 1 tsp of salt free Becel in each half and 1 tsp of local maple syrup sugar, I sprinkled with Mrs Dash and black pepper before serving.

Delicious. I remember my Mom used to bake acorn squash all the time and I loved it, so I wanted to give this a try when I saw the squash at the store. I added double the butter though as I used 1 T per half and baked both halves side by side open faced. I did score the flesh inside once they were soft so the butter could get all throughout. This was good and even my husband mentioned he liked it. I think I will try microwaving it the next time as this took over an hour to have ready.

Simple, easy, good. Definitely add criss crosses and don't put one half on top of the other (divide ingredients in each half) like Kathryno suggested. I also put tin foil on top of the pan the last 15 minutes it was baking to preserve moisture.

This was so easy and flavorful! My husband and I loved it.  We grilled these instead of baking.  Wrapped them up in foil to seal in the butter and turned once. He added cinnamon to his before grilling to add some spice.  It was so tender. Thanks for sharing

I followed the advice of another reviewer and microwaved it first instead of baking it. This went really well with Roast Chicken and Mashed Potatoes.

I didn't care for this much, so I added two tablespoons of flour to the squash mixture, some raisins, a healthy amount of coconut, and some honey and fried the mixture, ala potato pancakes.

Nothing wrong with the original recipe.  It just wasn't to my liking.

This was my first time making acorn squash and I thought this was a super easy and delicious recipe.  I made a few changes for my personal preference but I'm giving it 5 stars because I'm sure it would have been great as is.  In addition to the butter and brown sugar, I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg and a drizzle of maple syrup.  Very good!

I meant to only change the cooking method. I used the microwave. I cut off the bottom just enough so it wouldn't rock, set it in a bowl with a tad of water.  I ended up changing an ingredient, cuz, well I dont know why. I used white sugar instead of brown, just was off in la-la-land I guess. I did also add a tad bit of sea salt through the grinder.

Used olive oil instead of butter for dietary reasons. I think it would have tasted better with butter! Might try to use grapeseed oil or other more neutral oil next time.

I just baked in a baking pan with some water for 45 mins. and they cooked just fine.  I thought there was too much butter and sugar.  Next time I will try only 1/4 T. butter and 1/2 T. of brown sugar per each acorn half.

This was really good, but I felt like butter was the most prominent flavor.  The butter soaked right into the squash (which was delicious) but it needed something else.  Next time I'll add some cinnamon and nutmeg to give it more flavor.  Overall great recipe!

Tender, yummy, not too sweet...AND easy to make! I added a little water (an inch, maybe?) to the baking dish when I was baking them flesh-down. I skipped the third step...instead, I just turned the squash flesh-side-up, added the yummy things, and put it back in the oven to finish baking. I added cinnamon and nutmeg when I made it, but my husband said it would probably be better without the cinnamon next time.

This a great recipe but microwaving the halves for 4 minutes inside a plastic bag speeds up the process and stops the squash from drying out.  I also like to add a tablespoon of chopped walnuts to the butter sugar mixture, makes for a nice surprise for those who might not be a squash fan like my husband

Easy to make this way in the oven.  I think I just may have had a bad squash...it was a little too stringy for our liking.  Will try again.

I cut in half, seed and place cut side down in a little bit of water and bake in microwave oven till soft--doesn't take long. Remove and place cut side up, fill centers with brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and chopped apples. Return to microwave until sugar is melted and apples are tender.

We all really liked this & I will be making again but I am a little confused about serving it. I put in the butter & sugar and put the top on then cooked it for another 1/2 hour. Once it was done I wasn't sure how to serve it so I scooped it out of the skin and mashed it up. It was NOT easy to get out of the skin but worth the work.

So yummy!!!  Made it to serve along side a ham dinner.  I swirled a bit of maple syrup arount edges when acorn squash was right side up.  I also spinkled just a tad of salt and black pepper to just enhance it's natural flavors.  A very simple recipe that shows through the acorn squash flavor.  Next day - makes great leftovers for lunch.  Will definately be part of my repertoire.

Very yummy. Even the 2-year-old ate it. I did the microwave for 5 minutes first, then about 30 minutes in a 400 degree oven.

I have been making acorn squash for a long time.  This is a good beginning.  Cinammon makes it yummy.  I sometimes put in applesauce as well.  That makes it terrific!    The squash can be difficult to cut.  If it is too hard, I put it in the microwave until it is soft enough to cut with a knife.

I've always cooked mine like this with cinnamon added as well.  A friend makes it like the recipe but adds some creamed styled corn to the well before serving.  Great either way!  We all need to be eating more veggies anyway we can.

Yum, yum, yum...a sensual sweet and nutty flavor that brings the anticipation of autumn straight in from your oven! Me and my husband both love this dish! I did microwave the halves first for 6 mins a piece to save some time w/ about a half inch of salted water in the bottom to make it tender and tasty.

I did cook it halved with the butter and brown sugar, covered, for 45 minutes and uncovered for another 10.  It was wonderful.  I also tried the suggestion on 2 of my 4 halves of adding bacon and I have to say that was a really good addition too.  Will make this again in a heartbeat.

Easy to make and great reviews / suggestions!  I followed the microwave suggestions (5 min on high, upside down with 1/2 cup water).  And, then transferred to the oven after coating the edges & inside with 1 tbsp of butter, nutmeg, cinnamon and I used 1 tbsp of brown sugar.  Since I was cooking something else at 400 that's the temp I used, but didn't go as long.  Maybe 10 min.  Delicious!

This is a simple and delicious dish.  I'm the only one in my family that likes squash, so I eat half for dinner and half for lunch.  I like to cook them in the microwave.  I place them, cut sides up,in a glass dish with a little water in the bottom.  I spread a little light stick margarine on the insides and sprinkle it with Splenda brown sugar blend.  Cover and microwave for 10 to 12 minutes on high power.  Easy, tasty, and nutritious!

I enjoyed this recipe.  Just made it for Thanksgiving and changed it so that it could be served in a dish for a buffet style dinner. Roast the squash cut side down until it starts to warp.  Scoop out flesh into casserole dish and then mix in desired amount of butter and brown sugar.  Mash together and serve!

Good taste, but I found difficult to find an ovenproof content that I could fit it in so it doesn't roll over during cooking. Next time I will just turn the two pieces face up and add half of the brown sugar mixture to them.

I LOVE this recipe! I never liked squash until I tried it this way, and now it's one of my favorite side dishes. I do things a little differently though. I halve the squash, scoop out the middle, pierce many times with a knife or fork (especially around the top edge), add the sugar/margarine and bake at 400 for about 40min. While baking I take it out every 10-15min and 'baste' with the melted sugar/margarine sauce. With all the piercings, the sauce really gets into the flesh and makes it nice and soft. 

Next time I will try scooping it out and mashing it, that sounds yummy!

We grew acorn squash in our garden this year and only one made it.  We weren't sure how to prepare it but followed this recipe using maple syrup instead of brown sugar and it was so good.  I didn't realize that acorn squash already had a nutty, buttery taste so it was perfect.  Now we will buy acorn squash and do this again!

I made sweet & spicy Acorn Squash. I used Coconut oil instead of butter. Then I added Chipotle Chilli pepper, chilli pepper, smoked Paparika, garlic powder & extra brown sugar. I also sliced my squash like cantelope. Very, Very good.

Loved this recipe and followed the recipe as written. I served the acorn with super simple pork chops, also from the website.  My husband, who can't remember ever having acorn squash, looked at it suspiciously. But he is now a convert; loved it!

....delicious and simple Acorn Squash preparation.  My little variation was to do the "second baking" with both sides apart ...flesh side up.  I added the butter and brown sugar ...along with 1 tsp of bourbon to each of the halves ...and baked for 20 minutes covered with foil ...then increased the oven to 425 degrees and baked uncovered for the final 10 minutes.  I got a nice browning and carmelization of the sugar on the upper lip of the squash.

The only way to make it! Reminds me of mom’s recipe, just w whole lot quicker. Sometimes I use maple syrup instead of brown sugar.

I have always baked the acorn squash cut side down until cooked, Then flip it over and add butter, brown sugar,etc and place back in the oven for another 5 minutes or so.Then serve.Why dirty up more pans then necessary?

I made this on thanksgiving and it was really helpful not having to worry about oven, or stove space. It was so easy to make and it turned out delicious.

I have made this many times like this and have done other variations where I used maple syrup and have sprinkled nutmeg or cinnamon over it. This is a good way to cook this squash and it makes it easy to dig out flesh.

Instead of placing the squash on top of each other for the final bake. I left them on the sheet facing up. It seemed to lightly caramelize the brown sugar butter topping. My husband loved it!

It was delicious! I flipped mine flesh side up after the first 30 minutes and put the butter and brown sugar in it and let it cook for the last 30 minutes.

This recipe isn't unusual to me - normally I make Butternut squash but thought I'd try something different - it's pretty much how I usually make squash with a similar technique. I did try the Cinnamon/Nutmeg addition - it was interesting - didn't dislike it - didn't Love it - may try it again.

We didn't find this particularly great. The whole match-the-halves-together thing was weird.  I did it, but then found myself dumping the liquids into what had been the top half afterward and letting them sink in a bit. I wouldn't follow that direction again. I'm going to use a different recipe for acorn squash next time.

Needed to add more butter and brown sugar to appeal to me but then that makes it even more unhealthy. Sorry, won't make again.

This is a great recipe. I have used this recipe 4 times already and everyone loved it.
I change recipe a little..
After pre-cooking for 30-45 mins, I used a fork to puncture the bottom and sides to let butter and brown sugar to seep in before final 30 mins of cooking. I placed acorn squash side by side on cookie sheet.
I also added 1/4 teaspoon of honey and 1/4 teaspoon of maple syrup to each acorn squash half..
Sprinkled each with a nutmeg and a little course ground pepper.
Put in oven for last 30 mins...
Awesome :-)

I thought this was really good.  I microwaved it for about 10 minutes and then added the brown sugar and butter, then baked it for 25. My daughter was not a fan but then again she does not like squash.  My husband and I liked it.  Will make it again but may add a pinch of cayanne.

My family has made a similar recipe for years! Add cinnamon to the brown sugar, it makes it sooo much better! Cut criss crosses in the squash so the flavors get into it. Also, do NOT put the squash halves back together! That is madness!!! All the flavors would go to the bottom half, and not the top.

This was my first time having acorn squash. I wasn't that impressed especially because the butter & brown sugar flavor was only at the bottom despite me brushing it along the top multiple times throughout baking. That being said, it was a lot of calories for it being a vegetable (I've been trying to experiment w/ healthier options). Next time, I'll forgo the butter and just sprinkle half the amount of brown sugar on it. I took the advice of another reviewer and baked it on 350 for an hour and it cooked perfectly throughout.

This is a great way to do squash.  I have been doing this for years but with a twist.  We have squash when I make pork chops.  This meal is so easy.  Cut squash in half and seed. fill with the brown sugar and butter or use honey if you like.  Then take your pork chop and salt n pepper to taste and lay on foil (big enough piece to wrap pork chop and squash.  Next put squash on top of pork chop and wrap in you foil.  Put in oven and bake for 45 min. to hour depending on chop and size of squash. (350 oven)  The chop comes out so moist and the squash is wonderful.  Plus this is easy to clean up.  I use thick cut Iowa pork chops for this.

Cooking time was accurate since the squash came out moist and tasted good. I actually used maple syrup and apples to stuff inside the squash instead of brown sugar and butter. Next time I will try what the recipe recommends.

I really enjoyed this recipe, however I don't think I was able to get all of the squash out of the shell, plus I felt it needed more than just sugar, ended up adding nutmeg and cinnamon before serving.  My girls weren't big fans, but maybe that's just because this was their first time having acorn squash.  I would definitely liven it up next time, add a few more spices, and maybe try microwaving instead of oven baking it.

I made this today for my family's Thanksgiving dinner. Followed recipe exactly and it was very easy to make and all who tried it liked it. The only thing I would change is maybe scoop it all out and mash together so every bite has some of the yummy butter and sugar topping. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe after I stopped the bleeding...Suggestions for splitting the squash without loping off your hand please.  I tried it both ways, one half the microwave method recommended by some, the other have the long way.  I prefer the long method because the brown sugar and butter mixture "carmelized" in the squash and soaked in more.  The microwaved one was tender and juicy but lacked the carmelized mixture.

Yummy!  Although don't tell me the calories on this.  I'd imagine the receipe could be lightened and still be tasty.

I cooked them in the microwave first (cut in half, cut side down in about 1/2 water) and then broiled them with the sugar and butter inside. Turned out wonderfully (and a ton faster than original recipe). Delicious.

I just finished having this with dinner and it was absolutely delicious! I added a sprinkling of cinnamon with the brown sugar and butter. I also substituted Splenda brown sugar since my mom is diabetic. I will definitely be making this again!

Haven't been too crazy about winter squash in the past, but as it is currently in season I really wanted to give it a try again. Unfortunately this recipe didn't do anything to win me over; I found the taste to be just so-so and the texture pretty unappealing. If you like squash to start with, hopefully you'll be more impressed!

Very good. I recommend making sure all the acorns are the same size and I did not put the acorns back together for the last 30 minutes as suggested by another rating.

OMG!!! These are awesome! My mother never had acorn squash, so I told her about this recipe and how we all went crazy for it. So she attempted it. Her and her picky hubby were blown away on how tasty this is! Her hubby now requests it all the time.

I was feeling lazy and I just halved 2 squash, placed them cut side up in a 13x9 dish with a little water in the bottom, and baked them at 350 with the butter and brown sugar in them. After an hour they were ready to eat and delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

These are the same ingredients I use but I just put the butter/brown sugar in the squash, flesh side up, directly on the oven rack and bake around a hour. If I have something else in the oven I just use the temperature required for that dish and adjust the time for the squash. Always perfect. In fact I think I'll go to the store and buy a squash for dinner right now!

My family has done this recipe for years with a couple of variations. We do it in the barbecue. You cut the squash in half and put the butter and brown sugar inside. Wrap each filled half in aluminum foil and (make sure to keep them right side up) place them in the coals for about 45mins - 1hr. You can also substitute black pepper for brown sugar if you don't want the sweetness. It's really easy to barbecue, no turning is necessary if they are properly surrounded by the coals.

I have always made my acorn squash this way - even speeding it up in the microwave as others have noted when making it for two people. One night I had one acorn squash and unexpected company which we invited to stay for dinner. I cooked the squash in the microwave then scooped out the shells and spread the squash into a small casserole dish. I then dotted with pats of butter, sprinkled the brown sugar on top and placed under the broiler for about 5 minites. Everyone loved it and wished we had more. My company decided she will now make hers this way from now on.

Delicious! Took the suggestions of others and microwaved a halved squash with a little water for 10 minutes. Then I popped them in a 350 oven for 25-30 minutes with the rest of the toppings. So easy, so tasty and a great wintery veggie.

This is a fantastic dish, my only addition is a sprinkle of ground nutmeg and a pinch of salt to each. Oh, and I only cook them face up, with the butter/sugar/spice blend in them from the get go, and a little bit of water in the baking dish to help steam them a little.

Very tasty and a nice flavor change - I usually drizzle maple syrup over the squash, but really enjoyed the brown sugar flavor! I cooked as directed, but pulled it out early because mine was throughly cooked through in less time than what was called for and I didn't want it too mushy.

This recipe is AWESOME! It is hard to get my husband to eat squash, and this one did the trick! Now he is more open to new things. I followed the first part of the recipe to a T, then I flipped the squash, added butter, brown sugar, and my own special blend of pumpkin spice. I left them face up for the rest of the cook time. SUPERB!

This is a delicious recipe and looks really preety too when serving it.  Usually I don't eat squash, but I loved this.  Best of all it was so easy to prepare and everyone enjoyed it.  It sort of tasted like Thanksgiving sweet potatoes.  I think I would make it again.

I've been cooking my acorn squash this way for years, love it!! Although, form my expierence, moving the squash from the baking sheet to the pan is a bit unnecessary. I've never had one topple over....

This is the way I used to eat acorn squash, but I hadn't had it for years.  It was very good.  I used the microwave, and steamed the squash for about 9 minutes, with 1/4 inch water and covered with plastic wrap.  (The squash was small)

Pretty good basic squash recipe.  I'm not giving it five stars because it's probably more common sense on how to make squash than a real recipe :)

I've definitely had better squash though, if you wanted to make a fancier recipe, you might enjoy it more.

The masses have spoken. My family, less than thrilled to face a dinner of squash, were very suprised and said this was the best squash ever.  I added cinnamon, but didn't change anything else.

I HATE squash but my husband likes it so I tried this recipe out on him.  He loved it but the kids and I almost threw up from the texture.  If you like squash then chances are you will like this recipe.

Fabulous!  Based on other reviews I added bacon and put the cut side up for 60 minutes at 350 with all the stuff already inside.  Even the hubby who doesn't like squash said to make this again!

This is fantastic and super easy to pop in the oven while you are working on other things. The flavor is addicting . . . you won't want to share! I cut in half, took out insides, put in lined pan flesh side down for 40 min and turned over put in the butter and brown sugar and stacked them together and baked another 30 min. They were perfect! ENJOY!

Easy. Good. I'd never made acorn squash before but this is so good and easy I'll definately make it again.  The hardest part about the recipie is cutting the squash in half.

Very good!  I used a cinnamon sugar mixture after making another recipe for dessert as well as the brown sugar.  It was so good.  My 5 year old gobbled it up.  We wish we would have put more of the sweet mixture on top, even though that makes it a little less healthy.  Will make this often.

i took the quick cook advice of another reviewer, 5 minutes in the microwave and then 20 in the oven. Perfect. My husband said he would eat it again tomorrow night... and he has never been a squash fan!

Then, I also roasted the seeds.

Soo good.

Yum!  My husband had never had acorn squash before and was a bit skeptical, but we both loved this.  Maybe our squash was larger than average, but we decided it could've used a touch more butter and sugar-maybe fill the hollow all the way.

Simple and yummy recipe! I had something similar - but far more complex - at a Thanksgiving dinner once and loved it. I'm glad I found an easier alternative. 

As the others did, I nuked mine for 5m in the microwave and cooked in the oven for 30m at 400. Instead of butter I used margarine. Turned out wonderful! Thanks!

My family has been making this for decades! It tastes like a yummy dessert. We bake the squash with the butter and cinnamon in the oven, skipping the step of cooking it upside down. Just place tin foil over the top for the 1st half. 
It goes great with a steak dinner.

This was really good. My husband liked it, although speaking for myself I am jsut not that fond of squash in general so that made it less good for me.The texture (stringiness) sort of puts me off but if you like squash, this is a great and easy recipe.

I can't really rate this recipe since I followed pretty much nothing but I do want to give it credit for giving me the motivation to go out and buy acorn squash. Instead of baking, I read the reviews and microwaved for 10 minutes. And instead of using butter and brown sugar, I used a little bit of butter with black pepper. It was so amazingly good! Honestly, I think it would have been disgusting with brown sugar. The squash is so sweet as it is! The black pepper and butter, along with the squash's sweetness, gave it a really complex flavor.

Wow! So good!  I tend to skip as many steps as I can get away with.  Like many others, just sliced in half, seeded, put sugar/butter in middle and baked -- that's it.  So simple and sooooooo good!

We were making a puree of acorn squash for our baby and thought we would try out it too. Very yummy and delish and sooo easy to make. We used light butter and like some other reviews added some nutmeg and cinnamon.

Mde this last night...delicious!  I microwaved the halves flesh side down in a little water for 6 minutes to cut down on the baking time (was in a bit of a hurry).  Then filled with butter, sugar, sprink of salt and baked another 10 min right side up.

I think acorn squash is an acquired taste for me; however, my husband loved this!  He was the one who picked it out at the store, so I found this recipe.  I thought it was good, just different!

Delicious!  Sometimes I use honey or maple syrup instead, with less butter because of the liquid.  Mmmm.  Good winter treat.  Nutmeg works well too, depending on your mood; just a pinch so it doesn't overwhelm.

I had this at a friend's house and knew that I must make it for myself. I thought that this recipe was really great, but I think the butter was a little much for me. Next time I'll try applesauce and see what happens. Overall, this was a great alternative to regular dessert.

If you know you like it this is a great recipe as it is very simple-like the other reveiws said the cutting of the squash is the most difficult part. I had never made acorn squash before this. I found it was okay. I ate it but I didn't enjoy it and won't be making this again. I love veggies but maybe I just don't like acorn squash. Oh well, worth the try.

Very good.  I couldn't eat it all the night I made it, but scraped it out of the shells and it was just as good warmed up the next day.  Wonderful.

Overall this could be good but I didn't care for it. Maybe it was the acorn squash itself since I'd never had it before. I'm trying to cook more healthy meals for me and my family Just the same I gave it a good rating.

I followed another reviewer's advice and baked the squash whole for an hour before cutting & scooping out insides into a caserole dish.  I added the sugar & butter and microwaved with cover for 4 minutes on high.  Then I used my hand blender to smooth out the consistency.  Loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly and added cinnamon but I didn't love it. My husband liked it. I think the next time I make it I won't put the two halves together again because the juices only stayed in the one.I think would make it tastier.

Very tastey treat! I can't wait to share this recipe with my family at Thanksgiving, it would go really good with a holiday meal. The only problem is I think this recipe calls for too much butter, next time I make it I will use 1/2 tablespoon.

I made this last night and it was excellent!  I used half the butter, possibly more sugar (was just sprinkling it on), and I also sprinkled it with cinnamon, which I think is a must.  It tasted fantastic!  I'd had squash like this once before when I was about 12 and I didn't like it at all, maybe this recipe is a bit different than the one my mom used (I think it might have been white sugar and I remember it tasted too buttery) or the squash I made it with was a better one.  In any case, I'm making this again!

I used a non-dairy butter replacement to accommodate family food allergies.  Was very good and everybody liked it.

I didn't like having to remove from oven to add butter and brown sugar and putting 'tops' on.  Then when done, taking tops off and splitting  butter /brown sugar mixture before serving.

After taking the halves out of the oven the first time, instead of placing one on the other in a dish and popping it back in, I’d recommend placing the two halves gave up on the pan you’re already using with the ingredients inside. They’ll stay face up on their own so don’t worry about them tipping!

Haven't made acorn squash in years and needed a refresher....I agree though that I might microwave it for 5 minutes but for me it was a cutting issue. I would make slits first of course then cut and bake as the recipe calls for. Can't wait to make it again soon! Back to the Farmers Market I go.... Smiles

I've made this on many occasions and highly recommend it. My family loves this recipe and this is the first one for acorn squash that I've ever tried. Very easy to make unless you get an unruly uncooperative squash.
This is a must try!

I substituted maple syrup instead of brown sugar. It came out really nice and was easy to make. I will make it again.

Our family has made this recipe for years.  The only difference is that we also dust the cut squash with cinnamon before baking.  My mother also baked acorn squash with an undiluted can of cream of mushroom soup, split between the two halves of the squash.  Either way, these are very tasty and a perfect side.

First I placed the cut squash in the microwave, about 10 mins, then into the oven for about 20 mins.  Added the butter and sugar and cooked another 10.  Came out very nicely with a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top!

In my version, I bake for half the cooking time, rubbed with olive oil, season each half with salt and pepper. Then to half;  I add 1 Tbsp of Bourbon, the butter,  brown sugar, along with a Tbsp'ish of raisins and then dust with cinnamon. Return to the oven for the remainder of the cooking time.

Those suggesting microwave- microwave does not allow for the natural sugars to caramelize and create a deep, rich flavor. Just popped one in the oven. Cut in half, face down on police oil covered foil baking sheet. Will season, as recipe  suggests! Yummy!

Had cooked acorn squash only once before and did not care for it much. When I found this recipe, I thought...oh well, I have the squash...here goes. The recipe seemed too simple! 
To make it faster, I used the InstaPot, cooking the halves for 15 minutes, then released the pressure. So well done they almost fell apart, so I put the mashed flesh into a oven proof bowl, added 2 T brown sugar, about a T of butter and a t of coconut oil.  Sprinked 1/2 t of cinnamon on top and warmed it while something else was cooking (not necessary if already warm enough) and we devoured it....delicious! Will make for Thanksgiving dinner.

Would have given it a 5 star for easy cooking!  But there was WAY TOO MUCH BUTTER!
Needed 1 tsp. Butter 
                  1 tsp. Brown sugar 
                  1/2 tsp of CINNAMON

I added some water to the pan while they were upside down. I also added allspice into the brown sugar butter mixture. About 1/3 to 1/4 tsp with each half squash.

I prefer this over sweet potatoes.
Hubby prefers sweets because he's not fond of scooping the shell.

Only changes I made were method (5-6 minutes in the microwave, then 20 minutes in oven) and amounts of butter and sugar. I used 1 tsp. of butter in each half and had a pool of melted butter; I can't imagine a tablespoon per half! I used much less brown sugar too. As a kid, this was pretty much the only way we ate acorn squash. Thanks for the delicious memory! Will definitely make again.

This was ok, but the toppings didn’t seep through to the whole squash, so you could only taste it in the top layer...the rest was kind of bland.

Have made this recipe several times with homegrown butternut squash, except using Monastery creamed honey (almond flavor) from the monks at Holy Cross Abbey in Berryville, Virginia instead of brown sugar. Delicious!

I did this in the nuke machine for about 6.5 minutes and it came out rather hot but it turned out really good and soft.

Very delicious! Just make sure to only put the amount of butter and brown sugar that is in the recipe. I added extra and it was too strong.

I was able to make this in 40 minutes. Baked with the open side down for 15 minutes and then flipped them so the open side was up. Added 1T butter and 2T honey (I didn’t have brown sugar) and baked for another 25 minutes. It was very yummy!

Came out very nicely. The flesh was soft and easy to get out. It seemed strange to put one half on top of the other. and it did make it a little harder to dole out the butter and brown sugar, but I think that may have helped make it cook evenly inside. I will make this one this way again.

I "cheated" and microwaved halves for 5 min like another reviewer before final baking, still just as fabulous when you're short on time.  Also one time I accidentally used raw sugar instead of brown - still good but definitely not AS good :)

Best acorn squash I’ve had to date. Just honestly don’t think I’m the biggest fan of acorn squash. So it’s not the recipe I didn’t like I love the combination of brown sugar and butter. I think it’s the squash itself I don’t like.

This was so good. My husband just had his teeth extracted, getting ready for dentures. I needed something filling but something smooth that he didn't have to chew. I followed this recipe exactly except, I scooped out all of the meat and took an electric mixer to it. I then piled it back into a shell. He wolfed it all down and was so full by the end of his meal. Thanks so much for this recipe. I may have served it a bit differently, but I followed the recipe exactly as posted.

I just bake it whole in the microwave for about 8-10 minutes...then you can cut in half, seed it and bake any way you like.  I like butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar!

The method of baking works well...but my squash must've been much bigger than what was written for 'cos it took a good 30 minutes longer to bake. PLUS i need to use more butter, sugar. & add some salt. pepper and allspice or cinnamon to the softened squash. My family prefers a bit more flavor, but I imagine the more purist kind of people would love this!!

I have had acorn squash made this way most of my life.  But my mother made it open faced, with butter, brown sugar, nutmeg, and pecans!  If you like pecans, this is fabulous.

My wife of late had a similar recipe. This was a match for her tasty recipe. I did add 1/8 tsp fresh ginger root and 1/8 tsp vanilla extract.

I copied ALEXSMOMI (hope I spelled that right). Cut in half, scoop seeds and stringy stuff, feed seeds and strings to pet rats, microwave halves for 5 minutes, throw halves in baking pan, coat halves with melted butter, cinnamon, little nutmeg -- I had to go 30 min in the oven, but I did it the same. Cuts the time in half. Thanks!

I go by this recipe every time I make acorn squash. It is simple and helpful with the video. I put the two halves in the microwave, face down  for 10 minutes with a 1/4 cup of water. 
Meanwhile I cook a diced breast of chicken with spinach, salt, garlic and onion in a frying pan. When both are ready, I salt and pepper the two halves and sprinkle cumin powder on top. I placed a tablespoon of butter in a half  and filled with the chicken mix, then covered. The wife loved it.

I used the suggestion of another review and did not put the two sides together.  I used the exact ingredients and added a little bit of water to the cooking dish (because my mother always did that) taste and consistency was very good.  Will use this recipe again.

I enjoy doing my own thing with recipes.  Needless to say I don't stick strictly to the recipe as printed.
I added my own touch by using a little orange juice, cinnamon, and butter.  I try to avoid refined sugar so used a bit of honey as my sweetener.
I'm pleased with the end result.  My husband said 'it tastes like some more.'  We had it a second time warmed up and was still just as good.

Being a novice regarding squash I found this use of acorn squash quite good.  I cut it in half and baked it cut side down for about 45mins. then put cut side up to add the butter and brown sugar to finish baking.  I did however,  use brown sugar, cinnamon and chopped pecans as we use this mix on baked sweet potatoes and it was perfect.  Thanks for reminding me how good acorn squash can be.

I added coconut oil instead of butter and honey instead of brown sugar.

After it finished, I let it cool down for a 1/2 hour and then I scooped out the oil, honey, and flesh into a bowl and then I mashed them altogether.  It was great!

So I marked that I made this but I used a slightly different method. Instead of 30 to 45 min at 350, I did 20 to 25 min at 425 degrees. Take it out, poke holes all around with a fork, add your butter and sugar, then back in for another 25 to 30 min. It came out perfect.

Pretty dang good. I made it as-is the first time and it was really good. After having a few bites, I  decided to add a sprinkle of nutmeg and that really just made it shine.  I did find that the brown sugar and butter didn't sink in as well as I'd like though

So the next time, I scored the inside of the squash just a little bit  and the brown sugar and butter mixture really got into the squash a lot more. I also didn't put one half over the other, so the mixture got more into the squash. Be very careful when scoring it though. On one of the halves, I scored too much and the butter leaked through the squash and onto the pan. The mixture baked onto the pan and was a pain in the booty to get off.

This was the first time I used acorn squash and was hesitant when I read the directions to turn it over first then on top of each other, however, it turned out perfectly. I did add some butter and sugar on the other half because I couldn't see it getting any flavor with all of it being on the bottom half.

This is one of my favorite recipes for acorn squash! For thanksgiving I like to fill the each half with a vegetable stuffing consisting of carrots ,onion ,celery and zucchini and top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese,and finish back in the oven till cheese gets melted and a little golden.

I had not tried acorn squash since I was very young so on a whim I bought one and decided to give it a try.  It still is not a favorite of mine, but I did love the butter and brown sugar!  A co-worker told me the best way to make acorn squash is to cook it on a very low temperature for a very long time and baste the butter, brown sugar over the course of several hours.  I may try it again someday.

I love to cook halves in a dish with sides (with cut sides facing up) so they sand up, load them up with butter and brown sugar and put a little sea salt/kosher salt on the rims ( you want larger granular salt not regular table salt) salt goes great with the butter and brown sugar! bake at 400 for 45 min to 1&1/2hrs - check if done with knife and add more butter/sugar to keep full! Let cool a little cause they are HOT and score the flesh before eating so the butter/sugar gets to all the flesh! (Scoring before cooking make all the flesh sweet)doing it after,you still get the taste of the squash complimented by butter/sugar/ and a bit of salt-Enjoy!

I didn't place the one half on top of the other, but put both sides face up back in with the butter and brown sugar. It was super good!

I used the same ingredients, bake temp and time except I baked them cut side up the whole time and didn't put one on top of the other. Tastes almost like you're eating dessert!

This is a great recipe for me the 2nd time around...the creator should have been just as thorough as the video though...the first time I didn't watch the video and missed halting it length wise and also putting the halfs face down for the first 30 minutes

I could almost eat the brown sugar syrup by itself!  It adds amazing flavor to this squash and makes it easy to get your serving of veggies in for the day.

After flipping, I scored the flesh added butter, cinnamon, chopped pecans and a sprinkle of brown sugar to both halves.  Roasted both sides flesh up for 20 mins. Yum!

Squash is difficult to cut. I pierce it with a knife a few times and microwave for 5 minutes. Remove it and cut in half then remove the seeds (I put on my latex dishwashing gloves because it's very hot). Then add your toppings of choice (butter, sugar, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, nuts, apples, raisins, meat, etc) and either finish in the micro or in a pan with water in the oven. EZ-PZ!

Such a simple recipe for such a divine dish! Fantastic for fall weather, holidays, or just because it's so melt-in-your-mouth delicious. 
Elegantly served on a small plate of its own, with garnish, makes this a perfect appetizer or end-of-your-meal treat but is also appropriate as a sweet side course to the main entree. Ham accompanies this well.

Mine turned out great! Like most of you, I didn't place one half on top of another. I did however modify the recipe by adding half a tsp of salt, cinnamon AND vanilla; which I mixed in a separate bowl, and poured equally into each half.

Not sure what I did wrong, but it was a little underdone at 1 hour. 

Just to tweak it a bit, Not only did I fill the space with butter and brown sugar, but I also added a handful of frozen veggies for extra yum.

This is yummy. I have never had acorn squash before and this was excellent. The only thing I did different was after I turned over the halves I put 1tbsp of butter & 2 tbsp of brown sugar in each half and didn't put them over each other then baked it for 20 mins. It still turned out amazing!

I agree with those of you who said to cook the squash with water in the pan, the first time. Since it was my first time eating it this way, I'll add, that you MUST eat it with a spoon!

Great side dish -- so easy and perfect for fall/winter.  I followed reviewer recommendations:  Used parchment paper, split butter/brown sugar into each half, put them both fleshy side up in a 9 x 13 pan, sprinkled with cinnamon/nutmeg before serving. Made this a few times - never any trouble with the squash staying put.

Good recipe. For the final stage I turned the squash right side up and let them bake for 20 more minutes instead of 30, and spread buttery brown sugar on the rims and inside. Very good!

Hadn't made Acorn Squash in a very long time and this was the first recipe that came up in a Google search. Very happy it did! Couldn't have been more simple to prepare. Cooked very tender to the point of being able to eat everything except the skin. 

Knocked off one star because while one shell is very well seasoned with the butter and brown sugar, the one shell that's on the top, isn't because it's upside down.

Still going to add this to my Recipe Box!!

I tried this today.  YUMMO! I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and  microwaved it for 2 minutes just to make it easier to cut.  I too salted the inside with kosher salt a bit and then baked it.  The rest done just like the recipe.  This is a keeper!!

Very tasty. Thanks to others for the tips on microwaving first and then finishing in the oven.   Also, cinnamon is a nice added touch.

This is the only way to make acorn squash!! Sooo yummy!! I always pierce a few holes with a fork to allow the butter and sugar to seep into the squash. Love it:)

Fabulous recipe. I generally am not a fan of sweet vegetables(sweet potatoes, yams, etc) especially when sugar is added in, but this was great- not too sweet.  I also microwaved the halves first then placed in the oven cut side up w/ halved portions of the butter, brown sugar, and a generous sprinkling of sea salt. Baked for 30 mins.  Truly delicious..  Thanks!

This is delicious and simple, however I do it a little different. I do 2tb. butter, I also add 2tb. raisins, 1 apple sliced and 1/4tsp. nutmeg. I melt the butter in a saucepan and then add the apples and sautee until tender. Then add the raisins and spices just until all mixed together. It turns out delicous, more like a dessert.

I have never had acorn squash before this and it was wonderful! I didn't have a lot of time, so I did it in the microwave for the first 10 mins, and then into the oven for ten more, then finished it off with the broiler on low for 2 mins.   Next time I will follow the recipe to a t, but i expect it to only get better!   Oh, I put a bit of kosher salt on after cooking and it was very good.

DELICIOUS.  The squash is already sweet, so if you want to tone down the brown sugar, it would still work.   We ate it for dessert!

Great, easy way to make squash... works for all varieties of squash. Following the advice of one review, I added nutmeg. Do not do that! Yuck! My husband commented on the flavor too! Just butter and brown sugar and your squash will taste yumm-o!

For microwaving acorn squash - put the whote squash in microwave for 2 minutes on high. Take out and puncture a few sets of holes around stem on top with fork. Put back in microwave on high for 10 minutes, take out and wrap with aluminum foil until cooled. The seeds will come right out and you can easily scoop the meat from inside, it will fall away from the skin. Then do anything you want with it, it's like pureed squash.

I do something similar except I leave squash whole, cut off the cap at the pointed end, seed it, add honey, brown sugar, cinnamon and butter.  Put cap back on, place in baking pan with a little water and bake.

This is yummy!  I changed it just a bit...since my brother is diabetic, I opted for agave sweetener instead of "sugar"...and I added cinnamon since Dr. Oz said cinnamon helps to metabolize sugar.  It's a winner!!

First time I have had acorn squash -- it was yummy!  Baked it, then scooped it out and put in a casserole dish with a bit of butter and brown sugar!  Very tasty!

This is so simple yet really so good.  We love this recipe.  I recommend adding some salt, though, it definitely needs it.  So delicious.

This is a very tasty recipe. I have never made squash before, but I thought I'll try this recipe since it was so simple. In the last month I must have made it at least 4 times. Thanks for submitting it.

WOW!  What a great dish.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  I don't, however, understand why people would rate/comment on this dish if they have no intentions of trying it in the first place.  They don't know what they're missing.

This was my first time eating acorn squash and I have to say that it was quite enjoyable. Very simple and very inexpensive to make.  It was my husband's first time eating acorn squash as well and he absolutely loved it!  Thanks for the recipe :-)

Made this prior to Thanksgiving, testing items to add to the table.  These turned out great!  My wife, who doesn't like sweat squash, just loved them!  The brown sugar melted with the butter and fused with the squash, the spices toned down the sweetness of the dish beautifully.  Presentation was gorgeous!  And the smell of them baking was beyond belief!  A great way to enjoy Acorns.  Will be a permanent addition to our Thanksgiving dinner and special winter occasions!

This was EXCELLENT! My boyfriend had never had squash before, so I made this and he couldn't get enough. I made it a little differently. I cooked face down in the beginning like the recipe calls for, but then melted butter all over each side & sprinkled cinnamon, nutmeg, and a hearty spoonful of brown sugar on each 1/2. then cooked "meat" side up in oven for 15 min then covered w foil and continued to cook for another 15 min. Came out perfectly!

I love squash this way!  You can completely skip step 2 and just cook them a little longer with the butter and sugar inside.

Very good!  I thought this was more like a side dish than a dessert though.

Delicious! I served it as dessert and sprinkled cinnamon when it came out of the oven.  My family raved about this one.

I zapped it in the microwave and then put it in the oven.  Very tasty although it was very sweet, so I would serve it with some not so sweet foods.

Mmm, I don't make my acorn squash any other way.  My guy didn't like it at first-he said it was more like a desert- so now I serve it after a meal and he enjoys it better that way.  Don't forget a dusting of cinnamon!

I just put a little water on the baking dish and bake cut side up like my mom used to.  I tend to bake these while I have something else in the oven, so temp and time varies for me, but I'd say it usually takes 35 to 45 minutes total.  Simple and delicious - my favorite acorn squash recipe!

I love this recipe, Im make it with chopped up apple in the center.
Microwave on high for 6 minutes, then cut in half and fill each half with apple, a bit of light butter and a Tbs each of brown sugar. Continue cooking in oven until squash is tender.

This was so good! I've been craving squash for a long time and this was just what I needed. It's been rainy all week so this just made it feel like a nice fall dinner. I served this with some pork chops and it was yummy

This wasn't that good. Admittedly, I followed one reviewer's suggestion and microwaved the halves for 5 minutes before baking them for 20 minutes.  They were not even close to done after this second step, and I ended up having to bake them for another 20 - 30 minutes.

I really like this recipe- the seasonings are simple and just right.  Also, before I tried this recipe I thought I hated squash!  I make it the way another reviewer suggested, though, because it's easier.  Cut in half, season, and bake for 45 min.  Then eat- yum!!

Great tasting squash!
It was still hard after almost an hour in the oven, so I had to put it in the microwave for about 5 extra minutes. Otherwise - it was wonderful!

Excellent recipe!  I've used this recipe now time and again.  Yes, there are ways to save time if you need to (the microwave) - but I think that patience is a virtue, and I always just prepare it the long way.  It's sooooo well worth it! :)

I super duper loved this.  Saved it as the last thing on my plate cause it was more like dessert :)  My husband thought it was good for acorn squash, but he really isn't a fan and this did not cause him to change sides on that issue.  I did use a generous sprinkling of pumpkin pie spice.  I was already baking too much stuff in my oven, so I tried these in the toaster oven which didn't pan out for some reason, I ended up microwaving them at the end for about 8 minutes.  They were still wonderful, but I bet they are even better with those little oven roasted edges - I'll get 'em next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The all time best way to have acorn squash. If I'm craving something different and exotic, I'll put butter and apricot preserves in the center. If I just want comfort food, I'll use this recipe, every time. YUM.

I did not really like this recipe and think it took too long to cook.  My squash was still very stringy and not very soft and I cooked it 1 hr and 15 min total.  I like the microwave recipe better.

This is how my Mom always made them, except...instead of flipping the second half on top she filled both sections and either put them in the microwave covered with saran or in the oven with tin foil on. For the person who said it was to dry, you did not cook them long enough.

I've been making my acorn squash this way for many years and it is fabulous! My kids even enjoy it ~ I think the sweetness makes this kid friendly.
