We all enjoyed this very much. I did make a couple of minor changes.  I didn't have alot of soy sauce, so I put in half of what it called for.  Didn't have any tomatoes so I left them out.  Cooked for about 4 hours and it was done.  The meat was extremly tender.  Would add more meat next time.

Hello Everyone, this is my recipe and I would like to add that you could easily use more cornstarch depending on how thick you prefer the sauce. Also, using drained diced canned tomatoes instead of fresh works very well in this recipe too.

This is good and the flavors come together nicely.  I used low sodium broth and soy sauce and served over brown rice for a healthy and colorful dinner.

This gets more than 5 stars from my family. I was loved by all. I bought 2 chuck steaks on sale at Target to make the stew meat. Used a fresh pineapple & low sodium beef broth. Only had a green pepper, but this rocks! Husband said next time add mushrooms. I did leave out the tomato, the rest of the family isn't fond of them. This recipe will be in the rotation from now on!

my family (including me) did not love this :(  we didn't even save the leftovers.  I think the pinapple overtook everything else.  Maybe would be better with chicken instead of beef??  I won't be making it again... oh well

It tastes great, looks wonderful and is easy to prepare and clean up after, what more could you want? I used canned diced tomatoes because I didn't have enough fresh ones. Also used up the can of beef broth to cook the rice in.

It looked pretty and smelled good but it was tasteless.  I made it with rice and warm french bread.  Everyone said how good the bread was.  I got the hint!

I did not like this at all.  I'm not a fan of putting pineapple in food other than dessert, but thought I'd try it.  It tasted too sour.  Since this cost me over $20 to make tho, I'm going to pick out the pineapple, & try to add more ingred. to change the flavor.

This is the second time I've made this and it is delicious! I have used the stew meat once and London Broil once, both work great. I didn't find this bland at all but I did add some things. I used 4 cloves minced garlic instead of the powder. I browned my meat first in some olive oil with chopped onions, Worcestershire sauce, crushed red pepper flakes and 1 tsp of seasoned salt (then omitting the 3/4 teaspoon in the recipe) and fresh ground black pepper. Added that to the pot and followed the instructions also adding in some fresh minced ginger root , which is so wonderful with pineapple.I upped the paprika to one teaspoon and added more black pepper. When it was time to add the bell pepper, I added in the tomatoes also(2 big Romas peeled).Served over jasmine rice and added Sriracha at the table. Thank you for posting this easy and delicious recipe that can easily be adjusted to your taste preferences. A pleasing family meal! :)

This was very easy and great for a weeknight meal. I did however feel there was not much flavor to this recipe. I will not add this to my rotation but may try it one more time adding a few more incredients to spurce up the taste. Hopefully that will bring it back into my monthly meal rotation.

I made this today in my slow cooker.  I followed the recipe as written.  The beef was delicious but the rest of it was a little bland.  I have added additional salt and black pepper to what is remaining.  Maybe that will help.  I served it over rice.

Made this for dinner yesterday, but cut it down to 3 servings as there is only the two of us. Followed the recipe exactly except that I did not have any red wine vinegar so substituted Creamy Sherry wine in it's place and that turned out fine. Also chopped the onion and used canned diced tomatoes. Will be makeing again. Thanks Cat Lady

Excellent! Everyone enjoyed this! The only change I made was leaving out the peppers (due to an allergy in the family, but I would like to try it with them another time!). I might add a little more stock next time too.

Although this smelled wonderful while it was cooking, as with most slow cooker recipes, I felt the flavors were a bit mild when it was done.  I bumped it up with more vinegar, sugar and some ketchup and that seemed to help.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is very good and simple to prepare.  I modified the recipe slightly.  I added chunks of fresh roma tomatoes an hour ahead of serving time along with peppers.  I also used the remainder of the beef broth for liquid to cook the rice.

This was a great dish! My whole family loved it...really enjoyed the sweet and sour flavors of this meal. 2 mini changes .....first was to use a london broil instead of stew meat. The other change was to use a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the fresh as suggested by Cat Lady herself. I originally was going to make this with chicken ...but glad to have tried the beef....great combo of flavors. Thanks!

Makes a huge pot of food and is fairly easy.  I followed the directions to a T and it smelled delicious while cooking all afternoon.  I would not use stew meat next time - it was very tender but tasteless and this might've just been the batch I bought.  Also was slightly bland so needs a little more spice for us.  Otherwise enjoyable and would try it again with some tweaking.

Added a little crushed red pepper and Worcester sauce when cooking the beef for a little kick.   Used more cornstarch for thicker sauce.  Will definitely be making this again!

This is a delicious, hearty stew with lots of flavor. This is my third time making it as now it’s a favorite. Easy to make with simple ingredients. Flexible to your like. Being a “meat guy” I added a Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and it’s great!

It reminded me of pepper steak with the addition of pineapple...yum.  The next time I will decrease the brown sugar to 2 T and increase the soy sauce and red wine vinegar by 1 T each.  I also might add some ginger.

OK...I made this, but after reading several reviews that said it was bland or had no flavor, I did make some changes.  It was absolutely delicious!  I coated the beef in flour, ginger, salt and pepper and seared it off in a cast iron skillet with a little oil.  I halved the recipe since it's only my husband and me.  I used 1/2 red and 1/2 yellow pepper, onion and garlic as called for.  I used Hungarian Paprika for a little kick.  I also added a little ginger zing sauce that I had along with a little bit more beef stock.  Since my husband and I like pineapple, I used the whole can (even though I halved everything else).  I also added a few shakes of hot sauce with habaneros.  We like spice.  I added the tomatoes the same time I added the peppers.  I also think I used a tiny bit more red wine vinegar than it called for.  I think that's it.  It was great, and I will make it again, and I'd make it for company!

Very tasty, especially with the pineapples.  I substituted artichokes hearts instead of peppers and those needed more than an hour.  I used canned diced tomatoes and that worked great.  love this and will several it again, might try adding garbanzos next time.

This was great, though I would recommend adding a bay leaf to the crock pot before you begin cooking. It helps soak in the flavors and evens things out. We used egg noodles instead of rice and added more colored peppers. It went over really well!

Might be even better with chicken and chicken broth, and a little less soy sauce.

This dish was so flavorful and so simple to make. I added Worcestershire Sauce and red pepper flakes and I omitted the tomatoes because neither me nor my hubby likes them!!! I  served  it over creamy garlic mashed potatoes, my husband couldn't get enough! Not sure how anyone can say this was bland but for me, this will be going into my rotation!!!

We liked this well enough, but it was surprisingly bland.  We served over brown rice.  I liked all the veggies in there, but I'm not sure I'll make it again.

This was so yummy! I was looking for crockpot meals we could freeze, so I took all of the ingredients (except rice) and split between two gallon freezer bags.  I thawed one bag last night, and it cooked all day and is so delicious! I was worried the pineapple wouldn't still be sweet but it was. The beef got a little dry, but that is my fault we got home later than usual! A definite keeper.

This was the best beef stew I've ever had!  I did add carrots and potatoes, and instead of seasoned salt, I used Hawaiian Sea Salt.  So good!  This is going to be in my rotation for sure!  To the person who said this had no flavor, maybe your paprika is outdated?  Also the red wine vinegar is a must!  You cannot sub another and get the same flavor!

I pressure cooked this meal. I did step one, sealed it up and pressure cooked it for 35 mins on high (this was in an electric cooker). I depressureized, then followed step 2 and put it back on for 10 mins. I added about 3 times the amount of corn starch than it called for -- and it was still a bit thin.  It came out great and I would do it again!
