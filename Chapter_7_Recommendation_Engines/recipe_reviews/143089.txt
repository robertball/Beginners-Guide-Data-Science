I liked this recipe, except I put more sugar, a splash of milk,left out baking soda, and put a tsp of vanilla. it was quite good. Also for just a fancy touch I sprinkled powdered sugar on top.

This recipe is easy to make and is probably best suited for people who don't like very sweet food.

I made this in Japan with some Japanese students, and they enjoyed it, since usually many dessert recipes are too sweet for them.

Easy for kids, yes. Good, no. I'm really sorry. These just didn't fly at all. We really tried to like them.

Like others have said, not a super sweet muffin, and not a real chocolatey taste.  Be careful not to overfill, they don't puff but spread over top of muffin pan.

Really easy to make! Result was lovely: crisp on the outside and soft like a cloud on the inside! Made 16 BIG muffins as we doubled the mixture. Everyone loved it and we will definetely try this recipe again! We recommend this to any amateur cook for a surprisingly great result!!! 
:-)

I sadly didn't have enough cocoa powder so instead I used instant pudding mix from Jello. I'm not sure how muck I added but it was WAY more than it called for because the batter didn't taste sweet. I also added a fourth cup more of sugar, a splash of milk, a pinch of salt (to bring out the chocolate flavor) a tiny bit of vanilla extract and a little dollop of sour cream to make it moist. Surprisinly they turned out great just not very chocolatly. Very moist and fluffy. I love it.

The recipe was simple, but fairly plain. Definitely too much backing soda. I will make this again, but will add a bit of milk, a little more sugar, some vanilla, and reduce the baking soda (if not remove it entirely). It would be better with chocolate chips baked into it. I served it with a simple sweet butter, which made the flavor a little better.
