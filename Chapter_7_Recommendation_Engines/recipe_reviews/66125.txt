We have made this recipe for years in our family, but call it "People Puppy Chow".  My recipe is double what is described here, and we usually just use a paper grocery bag to shake the mix.  Also, it works best to put the cereal in a seperate bowl and pour the chocolate mixture over it--it coats more easily that way.  Yummy!

this recipe was quick and easy.  Most of the ingredients were in my pantry.  Just one bad thing, my daughter could not stop eating them.  I even liked them, and I don't eat peanut butter.  Very easy. Will make these often.  I cant say enough about these

These were great!  I made them for a holiday party and they were a hit!  Beware though.....they are addicting!  My only piece of advice is to be very gentle when mixing cereal with chocolate so that you don't crush the cereal.

My kids loved this.  We put it in "goodie boxes" for the neighbors and everyone raved.  Very simple.

My boys call this puppy chow.  I make it for every skiing trip...just because it is winter now.  I make it just as much in the summer for those camping trips.  Excellent treat!!

Wonderful sweet peanuty-chocolate snack; they're my sister's favorite!  Taste great icy cold (stored in the freezer).  Make really cute gifts in cellophane bags.  Thanks! :)

I was so sure that this recipe would not work, but I tried it anyway since the reviews were so good.  To my surprise, they turned out great!  And yes, they are addictive.  Super easy to make and very tasty!

These were good, but not great.  I prefer the rice crispy "chocolate yummies" to this recipe.  However, it is easy and quick to make.

This stuff if so yummy and very addictive!  I used honey roasted peanuts and a whole 12 oz box of (generic) Crixpix cereal.  I've also made the People Chow recipe from this site and it's just as yummy.
