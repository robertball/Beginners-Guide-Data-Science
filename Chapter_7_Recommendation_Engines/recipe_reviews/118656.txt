I am a huge morel fan and I just knew in my gut this was going to be good.  I was not disappointed!!  This woman knows what she is doing and it is worthy of the famed morel.  I am deeply sorry this recipe doesn't have any reviews until now because I know many selections are based on the number of ratings a recipe gets.  This is a great recipe and my wannabe chefs hat is off to the real chef who posted it.

The best!  Even works on the broiler setting in your oven.  This is my favorite recipe for quick and easy broiled fish.  It's a great way to surprise guest with an easy dinner and they will think you slaved over it.
