In my continuing search for an oatmeal cake "better than grandma made" I found this one. Rather than messing with broiling the topping, just combine the topping ingredients and spoon it randomly on top of the uncooked cake batter. Bake at 325 for 40-50 minutes. Delicious and no chance of broiling accidents and topping cleanup messes.

i accidently overbaked these because i left my oven at 400 but knew i had to get them out as soon as i smelled the flavor.  i made exactly 22 cupcakes with these (pour water over the 2 empty slots) and even though i overbaked them, they were fantastically moist.  i will be making again!  this time i'll remember to bake them at 350 for 25-30 mins

I've tried dozens of oatmeal cake and bar recipes, trying to duplicate the one I loved as a kid.  I'm done, this is it!  I have printed a copy of the recipe to keep in my purse because so many people ask for it.

This was one of the greatest cakes I've ever tasted. I made it for a party a.d everyone went nuts over this. You couldn't possibly be disappointed. And I didn't make any changes. (drives me NUTS when people say, oh this was five stars, but I changed every other ingredient????....this gives us nothing, people!?)

I used regular milk instead of evaporated but otherwise made the recipe as written.  I was a bit worried that the batter was too thick to 'pour' into the pan but it was better once the softened oats were added.  This is Delicious... both warm with ice cream or cold... And I would never have thought I'd say that about an oatmeal cake!
Update:  I have been making this cake regularly for the past three years... It is requested by family members all the time and coworkers love it... It disappears in minutes.  It cuts up nicely so it's easy to transport.  Truly a winner recipe!   Oh, and definitely follow the recipe and broil the topping... It gives it a nice browned tastey flavor!
Lastly, I have made this for people that do not eat coconut so have made it without...  instead just double the nuts in the topping.  Still tastes amazing!

Don't change a thing!! Being from the south, I had never even heard of this cake before! A friend from the midwest requested it, and it was a huge hit!! Definitely suggest sticking with the broiling - it caramelized everything perfectly! Thanks for the recipe.
Made this again! The recipe is still the best!!  Was thinking about trying it as a breakfast cake next time. Maybe add a little more oatmeal and a little less brown sugar/butter to the topping.  Would make a good coffee cake??

My whole family liked this cake.  The flavor reminds me of fall. The Brulee topping added the perfect sweet, nutty crunch.  I always follow the recipe AS WRITTEN the first time I make it so I can accurately rate the recipe.  I will definitely make again with a slight cut back in white sugar.  I'd like to play around with whole wheat flour, apples, raisins & spices.

Wow, this turned out good.  It took a lot longer to bake than the recipe said (mine took about 50 minutes), but maybe that was because I didn't do the glaze on top with the broiler.  I also forgot to add the cinnamon, and maybe that would've added a bit more zing to the flavor, but I still thought the recipe was great.  Just what I needed, having very little ingredients in the house as I did.

This is a recipe I thought I had lost. While visiting my grown sons they were talking about that "good cake" that I would make when they were younger. They liked it so well, that I didn't even ice it,and it waas usually cut while it was still hot. This is a gret recipie find for me. Thanks Susan. Oh yes, I also add a cup of raisins that have been coated in flour.

Very easy, delicious cake that can be dessert or a sweet breakfast. I halved it and baked in an 8x8 pan, and I used chopped almonds instead of walnuts in the topping since we don't like walnuts.

Fantastic cake and so easy to make.  It is my son's favorite.  He doesn't like coconut so I substituted pecans and he can't get enough of it.

Wonderful. My husband really liked these. All I had on hand at the time were steel cut oats and they are not instant. However, I still followed the directions in the recipe, save a couple more minutes of soaking in the hot water. They still came out delicious.

We loved this cake!  I had some muesli/granola on hand so used that in place of the oats - I recommend trying that swap!  Delicious.  I still put the boiling water over them per the recipe to bulk them out and soften them.  

Even my mother-in-law loved it!  ;)

This is so good!  I added a little more oatmeal (almost 1 full cup) and used less sugar.  2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla, and added a tiny bit of skim milk.  Did not use all purpose flour and instead used Whole Wheat flour. I did not make the topping as it was sweet enough.  I will try it with applesauce next time to make it healthier.  It is really sweet but just melts in your mouth!!  I think I can eat the entire cake myself!

Yummy.... especially the next day!  Excellent morning snack with coffee.  My kids had some after dinner with ice cream.  Only needed to bake for 30 minutes, so watch your time.  Only 2 minutes under the broiler.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.  This will be a favorite.

I had to half and half the icing, as my son supposedly dislikes coconut so I made caramel frosting II from another Allrecipes recipe.  And I left out the nuts as my S/O dislikes them. It was a very moist cake. Awesome!

So good.  I was looking for a recipe to use up some stuff I had in the cupboard and I just so happened to have almost all the ingredients.  I didn't have the nuts that it called for but I used almonds instead and it tasted just fine.  I particularly liked the topping after putting it under the broiler, nice and crusty top.  I will be making this again.

This recipes is similar to the one that my grandmother used to make. She used oil instead of butter and increased the amount of the flour and sugar and added some vanilla to her frosting. Both very similar with a few tweaks. The frositng is very sweet! Overall, very good recipe.

I have had this recipe for years although my recipe calls for the topping to be added after the cake has cooled and put it under the broiler for a few minutes until it browns and carmelizes. Everyone I know absolutely loves it, it is my husbands favorite cake.

OMG! these are awesome. The broiler worked perfectly. This recipe made 24 nice cupcakes. There was a lot of glaze for this many cupcakes as you can't put a lot on the cupcakes. I'm sure it's perfect for the 9x 13 cake.

This cake didn't rise, and it was very moist and dense. Not sure if it's supposed to be that way, but it was still really good. Also added some allspice and topped it with cream cheese icing. Mmmm.

How did I overlook rating this? This cake was awesome! I did as another reviewer suggested by baking at 325 for 40-50 minutes instead of broiling, only because my broiler is busted, though I wish I could have broiled it as I suspect the topping would have been nice and crispy then...ah well. Still, awesome cake!

Less than 48 hours after making this cake, it is almost gone.  And there are only 2 of us.  Moist, full of flavor; great with dulce de leche ice cream or all by itself.  Careful with the broiler - in less than 2 minutes the coconut was beginning to burn, not toast.

My mother has had this recipe for over 30 years, and it is the absolute favorite of my entire family!  My husband has even learned how to make it, and does so for me every year on my birthday.  Definately worth trying!!  Just be sure to watch the topping closely so it doesn't burn.

My husband says my oatmeal cake is better than his mother's.  Thanks!  I get so many requests to make this cake that I'm tired of making it.

This cake is moist and delicious, and I'll definitely make it again! I used applesauce instead of butter in the batter and reduced the sugar to roughly half of what it calls for. It turned out sweet enough for my tastes without being overpowering.

I received a similar recipe from an acquaintance.  His called for margarine and no nuts.  Of course, I had to use butter and I used pecans because I prefer those over walnuts (walnuts are for brownies or fudge IMO).  I baked a half recipe in a 9x9 pan for 27 minutes, then broiled the topping for about 2 minutes.  Be careful or it will burn!  This is not a tall cake.  If you like coconut and a caramel-y topping with nuts, this is the cake for you! Oh, one more thing - if you don't have a hand mixer, no worries, just mix in everything with a wooden spoon and you'll be fine!

I made this cake for my 93 year old grandmother who requested an old fashioned oatmeal cake. She said it was the best she had ever had. Other than broiling the icing for a little longer I followed the recipe exactly.  Definitely a keeper

I really enjoyed this cake!  It was like a cross between spice cake and german chocolate cake (bc of the coconut).  Although I give it 5 stars, my family gives it 4 at best.  They just prefer chocolate I guess!

This was so delicious! I stuck to using the same ingredients as the recipe called for but reduced the sugar. The recipe calls for 3 cups but that seemed like a lot (personal preference.) I instead used 2/3 cups for both sugars in the cake batter and 2/3 cup of brown sugar for the brulee and ended up using only 2 cups in total. My sweet-toothed partner said that the sugar content was definitely not lacking. Evaporated milk or vanilla ice cream go quite nicely with the cake too.

As a young girl I loved oatmeal cake and have searched for years for a recipe similar to one my mom had in an old church group cookbook.  This is it!  Follow the recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed.  My husband and step-son ate half the cake in one afternoon.

I couldn't find my old recipe for the Oatmeal cake I used to make. I found this one and now I don't care if I find my old one. It was so moist and good. I took it to work and there wasn't  hardly a crumb left when I brought my pan home. My husband loved it too. I also added 1teasoon of nutmeg. So Delilah!!

If I could give this recipe 20 stars I would! It is absolutely amazing! It's moist and the glaze is perfect! So easy to make. I broiled mine on high for the full 3 minutes and it came out great. If you haven't tried this recipe, it is a must...A keeper for sure!

Made this for the Oaxaca (Mexico) women's Christmas brunch and turned out great in spite of some obligatory adjustments:  I used pure cane sugar vs. brown sugar and substituted chopped fiber bars (nut flavored) for the nuts called for. I'm still being asked for the recipe.

This is wonderful and moist!  The second time I made it, I used pecans instead of walnuts.  We enjoyed it even more!  As a side note, it freezes well.

I have used this recipe for years...don't like the topping though but it's great plain. I like to reduce the sugar to 3/4 c. each and add a banana on occasion.

I halved the recipe and followed the directions exactly, and I must say this is absolutely delicious! So moist! It is very sweet, and exactly the kind of cake I was looking for. I'm a chocoholic, and my husband needs a break from all the chocolate once in a while, so this will be a part of my permanent rotation.

Great cake! A little too sweet for my family, and it tasted quite...boring. But I'm sure it will go well with some icecream or coffee. The sad thing was I accidentally baked the cake at 400F for 10 minutes that the top crust got burnt. I had to cut it out. Also, I havent tried the topping yet. I will definitely save this recipe tho. Thank you!
