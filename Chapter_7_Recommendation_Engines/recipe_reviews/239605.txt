Made these last night for a Christmas Eve treat and they were fantastic!! Only difference was I did M&Ms and milk chocolate chips. I also used Silk vanilla almond milk instead of non-fat milk. Turned out great!

This is a great base recipe that can be adjusted to your needs.  I like pumpkin seeds in mine with raisin.  The other thing I have added is a dash or two of salt and a few dashes of cayenne pepper to pop the falvour.

This is a fantastic recipe and a staple in our household. I often double it so that I have snacks and quick breakfasts on hand for the kids. In the absence of protein powder, use about a Tbs more peanut butter, 1 Tbs less milk, and an additional 1-2 tsp of honey, to taste (I use old fashioned oats so they don't like to bind as well as quick oats, but either works with these changes.)  I enjoy changing this recipe around to vary it up.

Wow these are fantastic and taste better than protein bars. I used m&ms since I had no chocolate chips on hand. Thanks for sharing!

I made these with a group of kids. Due to a peanut allergy, I used almond butter. They were delicious, with great texture and crunch.  I made double batch and refrigerated one batch The rest were gobbled up within minutes. I will be making these again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

Oh. My. These little guys are amazing. Instead of chocolate chips, I added raw organic cocoa powder. And sweetened vanilla almond milk instead of the low fat milk. Kept all other ingredients the same. Next time, I will add just a little more honey, peanut butter, and almond milk to keep it all together a little bit better, as they are a tad crumbly. But overall, these will be a regular item in my fridge for a post workout snack and as something to nibble on at swim meets.

Great option to get a boost of protein if you are tired of protein shakes. Used chocolate powder in place of the vanilla to boost the chocolate factor.

used walnuts instead of chocolate chips, almond milk, and almond butter instead of peanut butter. Super easy and fast to make and tastes great.

These have become a staple in our house! The recipe is perfect the way it is. I like it better without the dried cranberries so I usually omit those but otherwise I haven't felt the need to change the recipe. The recipe is quite flexible - can use vanilla or chocolate protein powder, can add in any type of chopped nuts or pumpkin seeds. We've tried several different variations in our house...I've made at least 10 batches over the last 2 months. My kids enjoy eating them for breakfast and I prefer them over store-bought protein/energy bars. 
Can't thank you enough for the recipe, Nancy Anne!!

Most excellent!!! I omitted the choc chips since I didn't have any on hand, and only had one tbsp of ground flax left so used two tbsp of hemp hearts and Manitoba Harvest Hemp protein powder, and they are yumm-o!!

Am I the only one having an incredibly difficult time forming the balls? The batter keeps sticking to my fingers and not wanting to form into a ball. Otherwise, the taste is just fine.

Amazing! We had to use regular sized chocolate chips and add 1 TBS came auger because we didn’t have enough honey. These didn’t last the day!

Awesome! I make the balls instead of buying protein bars. I add chia, hemp and flax seeds. Make with raw nuts and add chocolate protein powder. Simply awesome!

These turned out well enough that I will make them again. And everyone at the office liked them too. I did vary the recipe with following:
1/2 cup steel cut oats , 1/2 cup quick oats, 2 Tbsp blue agava nectar (instead of honey), 1 Tbsp chia seed, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon (1/2 tsp was too strong), 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips, and 3 Tbsp almond milk.                        
I found the original recipe to be a little too sweet and with too many chocolate chips. The steel cut oats give it a nice chewy texture. I tried all steel cut oats the first time through and had to add quick oats (and double the recipe) to get the mixture to stick together. This is a quick easy snack to make and to eat. I will add photos when I can figure out how to make the pics 960 x 960 megapixels. Any suggestions appreciated.

I didn't have vanilla protein powder, so I improvised with cookies and cream protein powder. I also added a smidge too many chocolate chips. However, I must say, they still tasted perfect. Great job conceptualizing this one mate! I foresee many more batches in my future... I think next time I'll even try dates!

We liked this recipe.  It is nice having something you can jut grab and know it is good for you.   otherwise it would be a cookie or chips.   the basic recipe is subtle tasting .  I used chocolate protein powder and added more peanut butter.  I did not but in the choc chips or the cranberries.    Start with the basic and add what you want, raisins would be good also

I didn't add the sunflower seeds or cranberries. Plus I skipped the milk which means I didn't need to worry about them going bad as fast.  I keep them in the freezer.  They are great after a morning workout or a healthy snack for a lunchbox. Just let them thaw a little before biting into them.

I love this recipe. I use it basically as a guide and I usually use at least 1 1/2 cups oats .  I melt the peanut butter but I use around a1/2 cup. I have used CANNA butter (CBD BASED but would work equally as well with THC ??) and works great  I rarely add milk because I ensure peanut butter and honey are enough. ??

These are amazing, the best protein bites I have found. Easy to make, a little messy but worth it. My only mistake was that I didn't make two batches.

Worked Well. Great idea with the milk to the protein powder. Helped “glue” the balls together
