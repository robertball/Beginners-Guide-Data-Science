YUM!!!  This is great, but I recomend a few tweaks.  I added some garlic salt to the marinade.  I also added 1 medium sliced green pepper and cooked with the onion.  Finally I buttered and put garlic salt on the buns and broiled that for a bit to melt the butter before adding the meat, cheese, onions and pepper.  VERY GOOD!!!!  This will definatly be one of our regular meals!

These were very good.  I marinated them overnight and the meat was so tender.  Might try with green peppers with the onions next time.

I made these subs for dinner tonight. I used deer tenderloin instead of the steak. I sliced it very thin and let it marinate for 3 hours. I cooked onion, mushrooms and a clove of garlic in the skillet. I added the meat to the skillet and cooked about 8 to 10 minutes. I put this mixture on the buns, covered with provolone cheese and put under the broiler for a few minutes until cheese was melted and top of bun toasted. Added chopped tomato and mayo. Yummy! My husband gave it 5 stars and said lets make it again! :o)

"Wonderful!" was the answer I received when I asked my family how the subs taste.  Only changes were to use butter/garlic on the bun and I used green, yellow and red pepper blend with onions, and doubled the marinade and let it set over night  They said there was no need to add condiments to it, perfect as is.

This was great, I substituted worchestire sauce for half of the soy sauce since some said the soy sauce was a bit strong!

Big hit - defenitely add butter and garlic to the buns before toasting as it really completes the sandwich.  Easy, quick to make and very tasty.

These were good. The soy sauce and cornstarch combo gave the steak a soy sauce taste. I think next time i will use a little less but other than that it was great.

I did not like the strong soy sauce taste.  This meat would be great in a stir fry.

LOVED this!  Both for it's simplicity and it's taste.  I followed other suggestions and added green pepper and garlic.  I served it on hot dog buns just to cut down on the amount we eat for dinner.  Even my eleven year old liked it.

This was not at all what I expected - in a good way! I'm not one for soy sauce, but my boyfriend is, so I decided to give this a try. I added some worchestershire sauce and Montreal steak spice into the mix as well. It smells WAY overpowering at first, but after grilling it tasted a lot better then I expected - hardly soy sauce-y! Will definitely be using this recipe again in the future - I feel like it would work really well for a stir fry, too.

I prepared my meat the night before and marinaded overnight. I also followed the suggestions of some other reviews, by adding bell pepper along with the onion and dashing with garlic salt. I buttered my sub buns and sprinkled them with garlic salt, melting the butter in the oven before adding the meat and cheese. These were delicious!! I will definitely make again!

So far I've made this twice & I added some sesame oil to the marinade each time; I like the sesame undertones & it goes well with a sesame seed bun. I also rubbed some garlic on the buns & toasted them in the oven first. I've used the mozzarella slices as called for and I've also used pepper jack cheese and both were good. We'll probably continue with the hotter cheese just because it gives it a nice kick. Anyway, these are really good and I'll keep making them, thanks for the recipe!!

Yummy stuff.  Have been craving a good steak sub for a while now and have just found the recipe for that craving.  Definate keeper.  Followed the recipe exactly (except used white american cheese).  Thanks for the post.

I made the recipe as is. I only added butter and garlic to the bread per other reviewers.  I marinated the meat overnight. The meat was tender and delicious. You wouldn't have known I used a cheap cut of round steak. My picky 15 year old son ate the whole sandwich. I paired it with baked French fries also from All Recipes. This recipe was very  easy to make. I will be adding this to my home menu.

Not bad. I made this tonight using red and green peppers. I only marinaded the meat 30 minutes per the recipe (I didn't have longer) so it's likely the strips would have been more flavorful with more time. The taste overall was nice but the dish came across bland. I added some more salt and it helped but additional spices may need to be added per your taste.

This is a cheese steak....that's exactly how they do it in Philly...slices top round thin (except for the marinade)...where the sub part?
