I requested a BBQ rib recipe that was similar to the ribs served at P.F. Changs.  According to my husband, the taste of this was very, very similar.  Its been 6 mos. since I went to P. F. Changs, so my memory is a bit shaky.  I'll take my husband's word.  The only change I would make is to double the sauce.  Use half for the marinade and keep the other half for basting while grilling.

These riblets are outstanding. My husband said that he'd never have riblets at (a famous chain restaurant famous for their riblets) again!! The meat falls right off of the bone, and the flavor is amazing. I added about a tablespoon of minced ginger root to the marinade to kick up the asian flavor of the ribs. Also, no extra salt is necessary- the soy sauce is salty enough. I have made them twice now, both times in the oven in a roasting pan. Definately double the sauce if you cook them in the oven, and turn the riblets a couple of times throughout cooking- there won't be any sauce leftover- it will all have soaked into the meat. They make great leftovers too!! These are a must try!

What a great recipe...simple and delicious. The ribs - and I used riblets - came out fall off the bone tender. I baked them at 350F for about 1hr, covered with foil. No leftovers here! Thanks!

Wow, I can't believe how good the ribs were.. really juicy and tender!  Even though I was in a rush and only followed the ingredients and not the directions (didn't simmer or marinate), I just slathered on the sauce and threw it in into the oven.  But it turned out perfect and my husband LOVED it, which he is pretty picky!

This is the best way to make ribs--by simmering them first.  They were juicy and tender!  This was a nice change from the usual, however, I felt the sauce was a little too salty.  Definitely leave out the 1 tsp. of salt.  Soy sauce is salty enough by itself.  Next time, if there is one, also take the advice of another reviewer and double the sauce.  You have to constantly watch these babies because the sauce really burns easily.  Even if I don't make this recipe again, I will definitely boil my ribs from now on before barbecuing.  It saves on having to cook them in the oven for two hours!

As did other reviewers, I also had to more than double the sauce ingredients. I omitted the salt and used brown sugar in place of the white. While this was good with the ribs, it was even better with the addition of a few good squirts of habanero sauce on chicken!  BTW, this recipe was chosen as one of our "Community Cook-Alongs" on the ourtabletalk.com cooking forum. Thanks for letting us try!

I didn't get to eat any but they said it was good, the thing that I didn't like about the sauce was that it burned really easy. I think I'm going to bake them next time!!!!!!!!!

AWESOME RECIPE! I had to use country style ribs, as I couldn't find spareribs. This sauce is so tasty and easy! Would be wonderful for chicken too. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Thanks for the great recipe! I did triple the sauce (minus salt) because we love lots of sauce.  I also used brown sugar, based on other reviews.  Marinated in about half the sauce or so, and kept the rest for brushing while I was grilling and for dipping.  My plan was to marinate overnight, but ended up in the fridge for 2 days.  Savory, tangy, awesome ribs.  I grilled with no issues of burning, just kept turning frequently until heated thru.
This one is a keeper!

Unless my hubby is smoking ribs, there's nothing like a nice slow simmer to make them fall of the bone tender. I had to at least quadruple the wet ingredients to make enough sauce for our ribs. I found the sauce a little mediocore in taste, so I added in garlic and onion powders, hot sauce, worcestershire sauce, yellow mustard and used brown sugar instead of the white. With these additions, my family gave these ribs a thumbs up. Thank  you for sharing Sara!

I had to add a cup of water to the mix to have enough to marinate the pork. It was good, but I belive I will add some brown sugar and a few drops of hot sauce the next time. Thanks for the recipe, my wife devoured it.

I cooked these in my slow cooker.I left out the salt and it was still too salty for us. I think i will try making these again with a low sodium soy sauce and maybe add some hot pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.

I have used this recipe for years. It is so adaptable to additional ingredients, or doubling the recipe.   We love it.  Making ribs right now.  Do it!  So simple, even if you don't marinate it overnight!

I hate people who change and then rate the recipe, BUT, I used Heinz Chili Sauce instead of catsup, and this is phenomenal. We use the sauce on everything we BBQ, sometimes I add coca-cola for a marinade.

I tripled the sauce, as per other reviews to make atleast double. I also left out the salt since I could add that later since one review said it was too salty. It was not lacking any salt so that was a good choice. They weren't as "fall off the bone" as my recipe which cooks them only in the oven and the sauce was not that great. They were only ok.

The sauce was very flavorful.  Almost a 5 star, but my family had a hard time eating the spareribs.  Baby backs generally cost more, but will try the sauce with that.  I did bake these at 350, covered for 1 hour.  Didn't baste nor did I make extra sauce, it is a good idea to do it though.  Grilling would have made it taste even better.

Because I was cooking for one the amount of sauce was sufficient, but I can see where it wouldn't be enough for five pounds of ribs. I'm not saying that this recipe was not good, I would have just preferred a little kick to them as I thought they were bit on the ordinary side.  I would suggest making the sauce a day early and adding a chopped up thai pepper or two and let it sit in the fridge for a day to let it all get acquainted. Thanks for sharing!
