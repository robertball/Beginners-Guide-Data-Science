I improve the flavor by adding a small diced onion and 2 tablespoons of canned diced chilies to the hamburger. I also spray the tacos with a little oil and bake them on a cooking sheet- causing them to turn out crispy and slightly brown.  I love the resulting crunch and that they can be eaten by hand once they've cooled a little.  I am single and find it really convenient to make the mixture and bake one taco at a time during the week.

A little bland as written but you can always add something spicier for adults! I love the way that baking crisps them up a bit (I rubbed them in olive oil) Kids will love this! I did not add ketchup because I don't care for it but I know kids would love it.

This recipe was so good! I came across this while I was looking for a simple taco recipe and decided to make this instead. I used a mixture of cheddar cheese and Mexican cheese. I added a little seasoning salt to the ground beef mixture and diced onions. I am amazed at how good this was!! This is a definite keeper.

This was amazing.  I had hamburger meat but didn't want a bulky, heavy hamburger, so when I saw this I thought I would try it.  My kids LOVED it and I loved it with added salsa and avocado on top.  I sent it to my sister, who made it for her kids and they loved it, too.  Definitely on our menu.  Thanks.

This was a big hit. I made it for 8 teenage girls, and they loved it. My husband loved it too. The sauce doesn't look very good - which means some of them weren't willing to try it with the sauce.  But it is great with or without it.  I made it exactly as written - turned out great.  They were very small though- I doubled the recipe, and used what I thought was "normal sized" soft tacos - but I couldn't fit a lot inside, and could barely fold it around and tuck in the sides.  It also made a LOT more than the serving size indicates.  So they must have made bigger ones.  They were still great- but next time I'll use larger tacos.

Super easy and delicious recipe.  Ingredients can be easily adjusted or substituted to taste.  Finally, something different than the usual sloppy joe!  Thanks for sharing, ALL my kids enjoyed dinner for once :)

The ketchup is a little much, but it didn't stop me from eating it.  Someone else mentioned salsa, I think I'll try that or maybe an enchilada sauce next time instead.  Thank you for the recipe.

Two of my children liked it as "okay" and two of them did not. 
I did not like this at all. 
The flour tortillas were dry, so that made the whole thing hard to eat.  The flavor of the meat inside was just not pleasant...it tasted like a cheap hamburger. 
I like the idea behind the recipe, but I didn't like the recipe itself.

I thought it was especially good with onions and peppers in mine, but even though I didn't add anything extra in my kids, they still didn't love it.  it was basically like a sloppy joe burrito.

This was so simple and was so delicious. We added onions and cut up peppers to the hamburger, but the rest we pretty much followed the recipe. We added additional salsa sauce to our light sour cream and it got raves from the hubby!  Will definitely be making this again! Thanks!!

This should really be called cheeseburger burritos, but they're a big hit with kids no matter what you call them. I have the world's pickiest 8 year old and tried these on a whim. He helped assemble them and ate an entire burrito by himself. He asked for another to be packed in his lunch the next day. I know everyone has picky kids, but seriously this is the pickiest kid ever. I promise, your kids will love these! Plan to allow them to cool so you can pick them up to eat. 
I made them as written. They were a bit mild for me but worth it for kid friendly recipe! Also, I baked for five minutes with foil off after the original 25 minutes.

This is my daughter's favorite dish, with a few modifications. We call it cheeseburger burritos, since they're rolled rather than folded. I use just cheddar cheese, and I lightly spray the tops of the burritos with Pam before putting the cheese on top. This helps to crisp them up. We really didn't like the ketchup/sour cream combination, so I serve them with regular ketchup.
