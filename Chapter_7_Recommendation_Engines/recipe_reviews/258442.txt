I made this recipe out of curiosity.  I usually make kheer with basmati rice.  So, this with just rice flour sounded like something different.  I donâ€™t like the texture of Malta meal or stuff like that and this is really no different.  Nothing wrong with the flavor, just my preference for actual rice in rice pudding.
