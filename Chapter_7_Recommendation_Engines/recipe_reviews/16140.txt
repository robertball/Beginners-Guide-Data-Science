this recipe is wonderful, but using a bag of brocolli coleslaw mix, instead
 of shredded cabbage makes it even better!

This was very tasty.  The leftovers held up until the next day quite well.  The ramen noodles lost a little of their crunch but my son actually liked it better that way. I also used packaged slaw mix. I think you could add some cooked chicken and turn it into a main dish.

I've been making this for years and it's much better if you toast the ramen noodles with the almonds and also add some soy sauce to the dressing.  Everyone loves this salad.  I also use 1/3 cup oil, 1/3 sugar and 1/3 cup vinegar.

Wonderful.  I used red cabbage entirely and it was very pretty.  Note, I put the dressing on the salad several hours ahead of time (except for the noodles that I mixed in just before serving), and this worked very well.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

This salad is awesome!  I have been looking for the right cabbage salad for a long time...there are so many out there.  The dressing is sweet and the vinegar does not overpower it.  So good!

This salad is excellent.  It is nice and light and has a wonderful flavor.  I served it recently at a bridal shower, as there were a lot of people there who do not like "mayonaise salads".  I doubled the recipe and there was not one bit left by the end of the day.  Will definitely make this again.

What great flavor. I added homemade sesame salt to it (I grinded toasted sesame seeds and salt together.)
Next time I make it.. which will be soon! I will try adding grated carrots just for color! Thanks Angie

This is a great recipe--I have a version that came from California (with my sister-in-law when she moved here)--she called it Fumi salad.  It calls for seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  We never tire of it.

Too much sugar, but otherwise a great salad. I've been making this for several years, but with alot less sugar. Taste before pouring on the salad. Many have complained about having to toast the sesame seeds and almonds. Buy ones that are already toasted. Toasted ones can be found in your Asian section of your supermarket. Toasted almonds can be found with your regular nuts usually with your baking supplies (cake mixes, flours, etc.)

This is a great salad. Rather than waste the dry seasoning packets in the ramen noodles, I add them to the dressing mixture before pouring onto the salad. Gives it a little extra added taste. Sometimes I saute some cut up chicken breasts and add instead of sesame seeds and almonds.

Great salad!!!! High up there with the crunch factor!!!! The dish was licked clean. I made some changes though... I used a mix or 1/2 green and 1/2 purple shredded cabbage. Added thinly sliced orange and bell peppers (just because they were already cut up and hanging out in my fridge). I added about 1 tbsp. of soy sauce to the dressing  and decrease the oil from 1/2 cup veg. oil to 1/3 cup olive oil. I love the crunch factor in this salad!!!! Instead of the noodles, I used a handful of almonds, sesame seeds and dry edamame. I will make this again!

This was really good.  I skipped the toasting step and used a bag of coleslaw mix for the cabagge.  I used the Ramen seasoning package instead of salt & pepper.  I didn't have rice vinegar - I will try that next time.

This salad has been around for a few years now with napa cabbage instead of regular cabbage. It is MUCH, MUCH better with the napa cabbage.

Try crushing the ramen noodles and toasting them with the nuts (alternately I use sunflower seeds, peanuts or almonds - whatever I have on hand).  I also find honey and rice vinegar with sesame oil with a reduced amount of oil make a better dressing. (I use light olive oil instead, just my preference).  Baby bok choy is also a good addition, if you want to mix up the veggie content a bit. This recipe lends itself to all sorts of additions, you can't go wrong!

I've had a recipe very similar to this for several years, and everyone loves it.  I usually throw in a can of mandarin oranges and use a small amount of the orange juice in the dressing.  I also use sunflower seeds in place of the sesame seeds, which I don't care for all that much.

Salad is great, taste was good too- I just thought that the butter to toast the nuts/seeds in was too much, or even unnecessary, since there is oil in the almonds and seeds as it is. You can just toast them on med-high heat till the almonds "pop" or crackle.  I also used 1/2 nappa cabbage, 1/2 regular cabbage.  My husband is still eating the leftovers, and thought it was pretty good too.

This is a wonderful summer time salad with plenty of crunch. I made the following changes that kick this up a notch. Instead of ramen noodles which are just empty carbs and the salad doesn't need more crunch, I added Soba Buckwheat noodles - they're cooked and rinsed; for this recipe I added three bundles of them. Then, I substituted Sesame oil for plain vegetable oil. It really kicks the flavor up and the addition of the Soba gives the meal a bit of protein. I have made this several times and sometimes I add cooked boneless skinless grilled chicken breast chopped into it. Everyone I've made this for has said "How did you make this?"

This is a great salad I make all the time.  I take it to work for lunch also.  I keep the cabbage in a zip lock bag and keep the almond/ramen/seseame seed mixture in a separate zip lock.  I have the dressing in a squeeze container and mix everything together when I'm ready to eat it.  Works real well and is always crunchy ! !

Tasty salad and very easy to make.  One of the best recipes I've tried on allrecipes.  I used 1 bag pre-cut cabbage coleslaw mix and 1 bag pre-cut broccoli coleslaw mix.  I did not toast the sesame seeds or almonds.  I added the dressing and ramen noodles right before serving to preserve the salad's crunch.  Everyone loved it!  A great salad for parties.  I ate leftovers for lunch the next day and it was still good.

Keeper. The second time I made this, I used peanuts instead of almonds and added the seasoning from the ramen packet. I liked this version better than the original.

I have been searching for this recipe after having this at a local bar and grill. I am so happy to have finally found it! I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I blanched the almonds and toasted both the almonds and sesame seeds before using them. Second time I did not. I don't think it made any difference. Very, very good! I didn't use the onions because I don't like them but it was still a big hit at the BBQ last night!

This was pretty good but it wasn't quite the taste I was looking for.  It seems like it needs more vinegar and less salt.  I let my sit for a few hours because I like the noodles on the softer side.

I was skeptical, but I was intrigued. And I was NOT disappointed. This salad has now become my favorite thing to eat! I used brocolli slaw and regular cabbage and both are amazing. 
Don't hesistate just let your taste buds do the tasting! and Enjoy! Plus the simplicity! Awesome! SO glad I found this.

Used already bagged cabbage salad. Loved the light dressing. Made a lot so will have it to use with sandwiches and soup this week. Really good recipe.

I've been making this salad for years. The only change is I use Napa Cabbage instead of regular or slaw. The dressing I put on just before serving. We always have a cruet of the dressing in the fridge all the time because my son likes it on other salads also.

this is a great salad!   you don't need the 2 tbsp. butter to brown the almonds and seeds as they contain natural oils.  You need to watch closely so not to burn, but otherwise very easy & good!

For this recipe and convenience, I used 2 (14 oz.) packages of shredded coleslaw and added the seasoning packets to the vinegar/oil dressing, eliminating the salt as specified.

Really good! I added some small bits of broccoli and used broccoli slaw instead of cabbage. I also tossed the ramen noodles in with the almonds and sesame seeds and toasted them a bit. Will definitely make this again!

A wonderful salad.  We use the pack of flavoring from the ramen noodles instead of adding salt, pepper, spices.  It adds another layer of flavor to the dressing.

Thank you! Thank you! I had this salad at a church pot luck and loved it but didn't get the recipe.
  I did try to make it a little healthier, for my husband, a kidney patient) The first time I tried it, I could only find Chinkiang Vinegar (a dark,seasoned rice vinegar that's kind of salty) The taste was awesome but too salty for my husband's low salt diet. The second time, I used Sushi vinegar (also seasoned) and was happier with the results for health reasons, though I, myself still prefered the taste of the Chinkiang vinegar. I also took a previuos reviewer's suggestion to use Splenda,for a lower carbohydrate value. (Better for diabetics and kidney patients). 
 Great tasting, either way! Thanks!

My family has been making this salad for years but we cook, drain and rinse the ramen noodles, add 2c cooked chicken and put the dressing on at least 3-4 hours before serving (overnight is fine too).  Always a winner.

Wonderful salad! I toasted the ramen along with the almonds and sesame seeds. I used a bag of shredded coleslaw mix and cut this in half. I used double the butter since I added the ramen to the toasted mix. This needs to be eaten right away though and the crunchy bits get soggy if you try to make it ahead and eat it later. It still tastes fine, just I like the contrast.

I made this salad for our office Thanksgiving party and it was really well received.  Like another reviewer suggested, I used broccoli slaw instead of cabbage.  I personally think it has a much more enjoyable flavor that way.  I also only used one package of ramen noodles.  The best part of the salad is the wonderful flavor that the toasted sesame seeds add.  This is a great recipe with a complex and refreshing flavor.

Great recipe. I made a few minor changes. I substituted sunflower kernels for the sesame seeds and I omitted the butter when toasting them. Not necessary and it saves fat and calories. I've used coleslaw and broccoli slaw. Thanks.

I made this as simple as possible because its been so hot here I didn't feel like turning on the stove. 

I used the broccoli coleslaw mix bag like someone suggested, used raw slivered almonds and didn't toast the sesame seeds, used half a packet of ramen seasoning and didn't add any extra salt, also cut the sugar in half and used some Splenda.

Delicious. My husband said I could make this salad anytime and he's picky about his veggies and salads.

Brought this to my friend’s for the weekend. They all loved this version compared to a few others. Like other reviews, I cut the sugar by about half, used honey roasted almond slices since I had them on hand and substitute half the oil with sesame oil with roasted sesame.

I have made quite a few different recipes of the Chinese cabbage salad, most of them I give a 5 star, including this one.  Its easy to make and used a bag of coleslaw, as its faster to make.

This was great! I made a half recipe. I followed some of the advice and used only 2 t of sugar (instead of what would have been 1/4 c). I also cut down on the oil a little. Fantastic! We all enjoyed it and there was just enough leftover for my husband and I to each have a small salad with our lunches. We'll make this one again! Can't wait to try it next time with sesame oil! Thanks for sharing!

This is a very light and tasty salad.  After reading other comments I reduced the sugar which was a good move.  If you want to add a little pep to it without altering the flavors just add extra pepper and allow the dressing a little extra time to mellow.

I make this salad all the time and it is one of our favorites.  I however buy the coleslaw that is prepackaged (2 bags) and don't use any butter.  I also put sunflower seeds in it and I add 3 tablespoons of soy sauce to the dressing to give it an asian flare!  EVERYONE loves it and there is never any leftovers because you can't stop eating it!

This recipe is very similary to "Crab Coleslaw Medley" also from this website. It has less sugar and less oil, which makes it lower in calories. The Crab in the recipe lends protein, so it can be a complete healthy meal. Great flavor and texture

I have been making this salad for many years, a little different version.  It is always a hit. Just be sure not to add the Raimen noodles and dressing until you are ready to serve, as the raimen gets soggy and it loses it's crunch quickly.
