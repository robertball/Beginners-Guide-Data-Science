Pretty good, but time-consuming to make. It seems like it took forever to cube the potatoes. Also, I ended up with a huge pot of soup, much more than I'd expected. If I make it again, I'll halve the amount of ingredients. I made an Irish soda bread to serve it with, and I think they will go well together (will have both for dinner tonight).

Good! Basically ham potato soup with a little variation on the meat. If you fry the bologna after you cut it in a pan to brown a bit it tastes better in my opinion and also I prefer a roux over cornstarch.  Added a few other spices (garlic, parsley, etc.)
