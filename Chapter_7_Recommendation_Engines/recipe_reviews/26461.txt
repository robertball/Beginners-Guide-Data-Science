Well I just popped on here to find something quick and easy for my girlfriend and myself and boy what a treat! 

I loved some of the changes other reviewers made, so I stole their ideas! (heheh) 

-I used the regular sized can of diced tomatoes and green chilies instead of the 4oz. can of green chilies. 

-I only used half an onion. (My girlfriend forced me not to. But there was so much flavor from everything else, you could probably put 2 whole onions in and not notice!)

-I used one can of mixed chili beans, and one can of San Antonio Style beans. (Saw the ranch style beans, but the brands looked kind of shady...) I looked at the ingriedents and the San Antonio Style beans were basically the same as the ranch style beans, and apparently you could just add whatever kind of beans you want really. (From the lady who said she didn't use ranch style beans at all!)

-Then I really shook things up! Some might flinch, but hear me out... IT WAS AWESOME! Instead of ground beef I used freshly made Chorizo from a high-end grocery store. Now normal Chorizo comes from a tube and is basically left-over hotdog meat blasted with a million mexican spices... this was regular ground pork blasted with spices, so it was delicious. If I made it again, I would used a half pound of chorizo and a whole pound of ground beef. The Chorizo added SO much flavor, I'll probably have to make it again without the chorizo just to see which way I like it prepared best.

I loved this meal, and my girlfriend who

This chili is wonderful and so easy to make! I substituted the ranch style beans for black beans (it was all I had) and it was amazing! Will make again soon.

We love trying new chili recipes and this was a big hit at our house. I used Emeril's Southwest for the "Cajun" seasoning. I made two slight changes: I used a 10oz can of diced chilies w/tomato and I simmered for about 45min. to thicken. It was a nice change from my usual chili.

This is the most reliable chili. I leave out the ranch style beans & use 2 cans of kidney beans instead. I also use 1 minced clove of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Sometimes I add a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder as well. It's even better the second day!

This was great!  It was very spicy and tasty.  I didn't have any Cajun seasoning, so I just used some salt and grill seasoning:)  Also used 2 cans of Kidney beans instead of Ranch.

This is the best recipe I've gotten from this site so far (and I like a lot). My husband who is a very picky eater, says this is the best chili he has ever had. The only modification I made is that I didn't add the beans (I don't like them) and I let it simmer for at least an hour to get rid of the excess liquid. Excellent!!!

I make this alot. We only use it as a base recipe. We can't use cumin as i am allergic and we cut the spices down by about half. Also we cut out the kidney beans and use chopped green pepper in place of chiles. I also added a bunch of veggies like corn, peas and cooked diced potatoes (added at the very end) and let it simmer 2 hours. Soooooo good. Even my kids who have severe digestive disorders(which is why low spices) enjoyed it =) Plus they got alot of veggies and didn't even notice. Also good over rice or pasta instead of potatoes.

All around great recipe. It's very simple to make and it tastes amazing. I think the best thing about this recipe, is that it leaves a lot of room for improvisation. I was missing the chopped chile peppers so I just threw in some jalapenos instead. I also enjoy my chili a little thicker, so I didn;t add the two cups of water. Everything worked out just great, and I'll be making this again for sure.

This really is easy, tasty chili!!!  My whole family loved it. I used kidney beans instead of ranch-style as well. I also added a 15oz can of diced tomatoes and, per another reviewer's advice, a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder and a teaspoon of cinnamon.  With the additions, this is a fantastic five-star recipe.

Made this wonderful easy dish the other night. Doubled the recipe so I would have leftovers which were even better.  Added Kidney, white, and pinto beans.  Used the diced tomatoes with green chilies and fresh garlic.  Family loved it.  Will definately make again.

Quick and easy and delicious! Only changes were no Cajun Seasoning (didn't have on hand) and vegetable stock instead of water (because it was on hand!). Can't wait to try it with the Cajun Seasoning. Hubby and kids gobbled it up!

A great basic recipe.  A little on the soupy side, so next time I'll add a little less water. Served with cheese and sour cream. Yum!

I've never made chili before, and usually am pretty picky but this was amazing! I edited it a little bit. I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis (along with the tomato sauce and the can of green chilis) I only used one can of chili beans, no kidney beans (bleehk!) and I added one can of whole kernel corn. I added quite a bit more chili powder and quite a bit more cumin. (probably a tablespoon more of each). I left out the Cajun seasoning because I had none but I added about a tablespoon of paprika and some salt. Served it with sour cream and grated cheese. YUM! Will definitely make again!

4 1/2 stars.
This is how red chili should taste. I used a can of dark kidney beans and a can of light kidney beans instead of the ranch-style. I also added a small can of corn. I served it with cheddar cheese and sour cream and it was awesome. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great!  I did have to make substitutions because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I didn't have ground beef or ranch style beans so I substituted with black beans and corn.  My husband and 9 year old loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

I used this recipe for my first time cooking chili. I added some things, like jalapeno peppers and some crushed red pepper (i like it spicy) and left out the seasonings and used packaged chili seasoning instead because it's cheaper. I found this recipe to be a very helpful guideline to making my own spicy slow cooked style of chili.

Quick Chili II Haiku: "Quick to make, and great. (I let mine sit in crockpot) But used the same stuff." I kept the ingredients the same, but I tossed everything in the slow-cooker b4 leaving for work so that I wouldn't have to think about dinner when I got home. It's definitely a mild, no-fuss chili that could benefit from additional seasonings/spices, or diced tomatoes, bell pepper, fresh garlic etc ... but as it stands, it was a pretty darn good bowl of chili.

This chili was very good and very easy to make.  I couldn't find ranch style beans, so I used all kidney beans and I didn't use the green chiles because I don't like them.  This was the first time I have made my own chili(I have made this twice) and it won't be the last. I find that if you leave the chili on the stove to simmer on low for about an hour it will bring out more of the flavors. The last time I made a huge pot and put the extras in the freezer and a few weeks later it was still delicious.  Just throw this chili on top of some rice and your good to go. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

Very tasty - I used drained black beans & drained kidney beans & lots of chopped celery - so few ingredients but amazingly tasty - it's a keeper.

SO easy to put together! I added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes to mine and left out the chilies (bf isn't big on chilies). It would be a great chili to go over fries and/or hot dogs too! I'm going to try that next :)

Very good quick chili.  I used light red kidney beans.  Forgot the green chilies so did not use those.  Still ended up with a good flavor and fast meal.  Topped with shredded cheddar and sour cream when served.

Easy and delicious. I used a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes and chilies instead of 1 cup of the water and the green chilies. The leftovers were even better!

This was fantastic! I only used about 1 1/2 tbsp. of chili powder, as my husband isn't a huge fan of super spicy food. I used a can of kidney beans and a can of black beans. And I didn't use the entire onion, I only used enough to season the hamburger with. Instead of using tomato sauce I used chopped tomatoes and it was delicious! Next time I think I'll try using sauce but I really do like my chili to turn out thinner like it did with the chopped tomatoes. Thanks for the great recipe, I will definetely make this again!

This is my go to chili recipe! Not it’s not thin like soup, but it’s too thick. Has a touch of heat, and it’s very easy. I like to add diced tomatoes, and sometimes diced green bell pepper as well. However, I only do half of the beans. I find 2 cans is way too much for our taste. Goes great with cheese and Fritos on top and cornbread on the side!

I used venison instead since my husband hunts and that's what we have around.  Also didn't have tomato sauce around but tomato paste so I googled on how to make sauce out of that .  So I only had about 12 oz. of sauce and then added about a 1/2 cup water.  Added a can of chili ready diced tomatoes because I love tomatoes in my chili.  Also used blackened seasoning since I didn't have cajun, but thought that might be close enough!  My husband added about a cup of frozen corn cause he loves corn in his chili!  I usually have to put sour cream and cheese in my chili, but now with this recipe!!  Delish flavors!!! I ususally make a little more soupier one but since I cut the water down to 1/2 cup it was thick and chucky!  I loved it!

Great recipe.  I love ranch style beans but don't put them in here.  Tried them the first time and the flavor of those beans takes over everything else.  I use canned kidneys and white beans instead.  Serve with cheddar and diced onions on top after cooking.  Great and simple!

This is my new go to Chili recipe. Not only did I love it but my mother and my roommate both had large helpings and even took some for lunch the next day. I love that there aren't a load of ingredients but it's still packed with flavor, and the cooking time is so quick! I substituted 2 cups of water w/ a can of Swanson's chicken broth, added a can of pinto beans and a can of black beans instead of kidney beans, and I used Italian seasoned ground turkey instead of ground beef. I topped it with cheese once it was in a bowl and every bite was delicious.

Yummmmmmm....I think this is the best chili I have ever made, and I make chili A LOT.  I usually don't mess with recipes, since I am not that adventurous a cook, but this time I had to because I was short on time and ingredients.  But I feel confident reviewing the recipe since I don't think my changes altered the outcome that much.  

 I followed the recipe as closely as I could, but I only had an 8 oz can of tomato sauce so it came out a bit thin.  I threw in what I had on hand: some Emiril gaaaaarlic tomato sauce and an 8 oz can of tomato paste to thicken it up.  I didnt have enough red beans at home so I substituted on can of white northern beans for the ranch beans.  Also, I browned the meat and then dumped all the ingredients in a slow cooker for 4 hours.  I wouldn't normally do this, since the cook time is so quick, but we had a crazy afternoon and I didn't want to worry about dinner.  I served it over bowtie pasta to give it some "oomph", and we were happy campers.  The kids and I agreed that this will be our new "go-to" recipe.  Thanks so much!!

I used black beans instead of ranch style beans as another review suggested and I didnt have a 15oz can of tomato sauce only an 8oz can so I used that and added a 15oz can of diced tomatos un-drained and no added water. My man likes his chili thicker :)

Really good and simple.  My husband thought it might need a little more spice, but I thought it was just right for the kids.  Thanks!
