My sister gave me this recipe. This is an authentic Puerto Rican recipe with no eggs! We use one can each of cream of coconut, evaporated milk and sweetened milk and 2 cups of  Palo  Viejo Puerto Rican rum.
My family and friends love it!
No eggs or water in my Coquito!

This is a delicious drink.  I will agree with others when they say to increase the rum.  I added 1 cup instead of the suggested amount and it wasn't enough.  I would suggest 1 1/2 cups of rum.

I make this recipe every year. My only variation is I use 1 cup coconut rum, sometimes more depending on who I’m gifting it too. My friends and family love it. It’s just like my Abuela Titi used to make in PR.
