This recipe sounds creative and delicious but delivers on nothing but taste bud confusion! The pumpkin, the meat sauce, the white sauce, the spinach…There is just way too much going on here. In addition, this takes quite a bit of time, energy and money and what I ended up with was so dry we couldn’t even eat it! I was extremely disappointed.
