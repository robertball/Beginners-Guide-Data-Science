This is a delicious easy recipe that my family loves.  It has quickly become a staple in our house.  I add capers when I have them on hand.

When I saw the recipe called for paprika I almost did not make this... It just sounded awkward. Regardless, I plunged ahead and made it anyways. I'm glad I did it was so simple and it was delicious! No changes at all!

Made exactly as directed and it's really good!  I make sandwiches out of it for my 3 y.o. and 10 y.o. picky eaters before I add lemon juice and capers to the remainder for the hubs and me.  Easy and delicious!
