Classic recipe! One trick to prevent the cookies from being crisp and flat, mix in a small package of instant vanilla pudding to the batter before adding the chips.

HERE'S HOW TO MAKE THE PERFECT COOKIE:  First off, make sure the eggs and butter are at room temperature before using.  Big difference.  Second, add 2 heaping tsp. of vanilla.  Third, add 1.5 tsp. of cinnamon.  Add the nuts or don't.  HAND MIX EVERYTHING AT THE VERY END.  Seems like the majority of the time, these recipes call for too much mixing!  If you've taken forever to do this, set it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.  Bake for the 9 minutes.  Put the remaining dough back in fridge.  Very easy and you will have everyone in your house loving you.  :)

This has been the recipe my family has used since I was little, however when it came time for me to make them they always came out flat. By suggestion of my sister in law what I did was used Baking Poweder instead of Baking soda, split the butter with 1/2 crisco butter and 1/2 sweet unsalted butter, doubled the vanilla, and used just 1/4 cup of white sugar and made the rest light brown sugar. I also beat the butters and sugars with my electric beater and slowly added the eggs. Oh and last but not least a packet of instant vanilla pudding just before I added the chips. End result, awesome cookies that were so thick I had to pre-flatten them before going in the oven!! Really thick and chewy....

P.S. I decreased the amount of sugar because with the instant pudding if you don't decrease the sugar it will be a little too sweet.

I didn't have any flour, so I used breadcrumbs.  I hate salt, so I put in chili powder. Butter is fattening--I substituted unflavored gelatin. I didn't have chocolate chips either, so I used ground beef. DELISH YOU HAVE TO TRY THEM!

This is my family's absolute favorite cookie.  I always double the recipe and keep the dough handy in my freezer.  I do have a few recommendations:  1) Use only half the amount of salt.  2) Use half butter and half margarine instead of all butter.  Otherwise, the cookie may turn out too flat.  3) Try refrigerating or even freezing the cookie dough before baking.  That will also help the cookie to be less flat.  Enjoy!

My favourite chocolate chip cookie - they turn out moist and chewy.  I use slightly less nuts, underbake by about a minute to ensure maximum chewiness, and refrigerate the batter for about 15 minutes prior to baking.  Great cookie!!!

Apologies to all you 5-star-givers out there, but there is something wrong with this recipe. The batter liquifies during baking, resulting in cookies that are paper-thin and unappetizing. I am 
more than willing to try the many suggestions for improvement available on many websites, but why doesn't Nabisco correct this recipe?  I'm a very good cook and baker, and these cookies are thinner than anything I have ever baked.

Hi, I'm from germany. Since I was an exchange student in Canada I just love chocolate chip cookies. I always was disappointed when I bought some at the coffee shop, they just didn't taste like "mom's". So I decided to bake some on my own and found  - after comparing with other 5 stars recipies - this recipie. The cookies turned out just great and were realy jummy. I left out the nuts and added 4 tabelspoon of cocoa. We don't have vanilla extraxt here in germany so I used two packets of vanilla sugar. I also mixed the flour, baking soda, salt, cocoa and the chocolate chips in a bag.  I put the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking. I also droped the dough with an tabelspoon on a cold baking sheet.

This is the only recipe I have ever used and I constantly have people ask me for it and comment on how great they are.  It helps to use less salt, about half.  Also, I use butter flavored Crisco and it makes them moist and they stay soft for days!!

You really can't go wrong with this recipe,  it is a timeless classic.  For a variation, I like to add oatmeal and peanut butter.

I have used this recipe for as long as I can remember and decided to try out some different baking techniques based on other reviews.  The first batch in the oven I baked immediately after mixing (result: flatter, evenly cooked cookies); the second immediately after refrigerating for 30 min (result: smaller, higher cookies, yet uneven cooking with edges too brown); the last was 15 min at room temperature after 30 min refrigeration (result: perfect! better height than the first and evenly cooked).  Taste is great as always.  Thanks for all the other reviewers tips and I hope this helps!

The original has to be a 5 star recipe.  However, if you want to avoid your cookies being flat, consider the following.  Use 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder.  Also, this is a must, chill the dough for at least 30 minutes.  The cookies won't be super fluffy, but it will be the best you can do with a recipe which uses all butter.  But keep the butter, its much better than margarine or shortening.  In my humble opinion.

This is the recipe I always use, but I tweak it a bit, to make the cookies softer and more flavorful.  First, I double the amount of vanilla.  I also use about a half cup more of flour.  Find that adding a tsp of baking powder really makes them light and fluffy.

These were great!  I form the dough balls, then freeze them.  That way I can take out a couple at a time and bake up just the right amount whenever we're in the mood for delicious straight-from-the-oven chocolate chip cookies.

This recipe can be made with ONLY 1 STICK of butter!! The cookies are still absolutely fabulous!! You'd never know they were made with 1/2 the fat!! A great savings of money and fat/calories!!

Just two quick changes to this recipe make the cookies so much better.  First, add an extra 1/4 cup of flour to your dry mix.  Then reduce the amount of butter you use by 2 tablespoons (so you have 14 tablespoons total).  You'll get delicious, soft cookies that stay that way!  

Thanks to my friend, Nicole, for these great tips.

What is so interesting about so many chocolate chip cookie recipes is how they have been revised to take out the baking POWDER out of the recipe, and how they have been modified to fit the 'harried' housewife (like me!).  Nestle, perhaps in an attempt to sell more chips or make it 'easier' on the cook, adapted the recipe to where there is no 'rest' period for the dough.  Originally, the Toll House cookie dough was supposed to be refrigerated 24 hours.  Why?  To let the egg 'soak' into the batter.  It produces a superior cookie, but if you let it sit for 36 hours, it is truly terrific.  Try it! You'll see a better looking cookie as well as a great taste.

We use this recipe for the cookies in my lifeskills, foods, and culinary classes at my high school, and they always turned out great! butter and eggs HAVE to be at room temp, you CAN'T melt the butter for any cookie recipe; the butter melts as they cook, causing the cookies to spread out and make their shape.  At home I use self-rising flour, so the soda and salt are cut out completely, and it's the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever used!!!  Due to fear of allergies at school, we always omit the chopped nuts, but other than that, the recipe is perfect! =)

Honestly, these were just okay for us.  We make a lot of cookies, chocolate chip included, and these were just not one of our favorites.  The dough turned out well, but the cookies turned out really flat and greasy.  I followed the recipe exactly, but will probably stick with the Best Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe from this site.

Excellent! I make these cookies quite often as there are a lot of chocolate lover’s in my family. This is a classic chocolate chip recipe and I always use this exact recipe when making chocolate chip cookies.  I always make sure I have room temperature butter and eggs. I add a heaping spoonful of vanilla extract and I use my hands to mix up the dough. Refrigerating and chilling dough in between baking batches helps to work with the dough, forms a nicer shape and prevent “flat” cookies. I usually end up with 3 dozen cookies baked at 10 minutes, sometimes longer for crispier cookies (per hubs requests). I never get close to 60 servings worth of cookies, more like 36 to 40 cookies. These never last very long! These cookies are always crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. In every bite I have a mouthful of chocolate chips and walnuts. Chocolate-ly, crispy and chewy, flavorful and definitely a 5 star recipe! This is a perfectly reliable chocolate chip cookie recipe I will always go-to.

These cookies are perfect, slightly chewy and super tasty. I used 1tbs of vanilla, gently melted the butter (never margarine or crisco) with the brown sugar and let it cool so it wouldn't curdle the eggs and made sure my cookie dough was well chilled before I started baking.  My family has been making these cookies ever since I was a little girl and they've always turned out flat. Our friend's mom's cookies were flat. Even the the Portuguese lady who lived down the street and was the best baker ever (!) had flat chocolate chip cookies. These are the real deal. Don't make them often because we'll sit there with our cold milk or hot tea and devour them all! Happy eating :)

Wonderful cookies if you reduce the amount of baking soda to 1/2 tsp or less. When you put the full amount of baking soda the cookies are flat and bitter. I tried this recipe four times.

I have been making this recipe for years and LOVE it! The trick is to make sure your eggs and margarine are room temperature. Everyone's oven is different, but I bake mine for 8 1/2 minutes, for chewy cookies you have to take them out before they look done or you will end up with a crunchy cookie. People always rave about my cookies and ask for the recipe, the are always shocked when I tell them it's on the back of the chocolate chip bag!

These are classic. They remind me of my childhood. My mother made these every Christmas. We used to cherish and devour them because it was one of the few items she baked as she was more of a cook then a baker.

For a while I searched for the best chocolate chip cookie recipe just to come back to this one. The only change I make is an additional 1/4 of flour and less chips(only because I really like the taste of the cookie). This makes a flat cookie into to a thick chewy cookie!

I just got done baking a batch of these cookies, and they are sooo good. I was worried from all the reviews that I would end up with flat cookies, but they came out very moist and fluffy. I followed the other suggestions by adding an extra tsp. of vanilla extract, making sure my eggs and butter were at room temperature, reducing the salt to 3/4 tsp, and using one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 3/4 cup of milk chocolate chips. I omitted the nuts (personal preference) and chilled the dough for 45 mins before baking for 10 mins... I highly recommend this recipe over all others! It will be my only choice... Thanks Nestle!

I have noticed many of the readers here have had trouble with this recipe - the main thing is that both the butter and eggs must be at room temp - neither should be cool to the touch before mixing. Also some of you are having trouble with the sugar not melting it calls for packed sugar so if there are in lumps in your sugar it will not mix correctly. Do not make super big cookies they will puff up also leave in the pan for about 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack this will flatten them out. Even thou the recipe does not call for it sift your dry ingredients. Also use a medium sppon do not try to make gaint cookies medium size comes out better also I cook mine at least 10 mintues. Hope this helps.

I love this cookie recipe, but I decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp. and add at least 1/4 c. flour. Otherwise, the cookies are as flat as tortillas. I also let the cookies cool on the baking sheets so they'll be nice and chewy. Also, take the cookies out at around 9 minutes- the centers will look raw, but they cool to a moist, chewy center!
UPDATE: I now always add about 1/4 c. flour- this prevents the cookies from being too flat, but still leaves them nice and chewy!

I actually don't like choc. chip cookies, but this recipe is amazing. I changed 2 things...I use chipits, that way it's not too chocolatey. And I also cut the amount of butter in half. I had read on the food blog "La Fuji Mama" about that secret. They turn out beautiful, nice and chewy.

After 40 years on planet earth, I've finally mastered these cookies! I like cookies that are gooey, and that the chips bump up out of the cookie. To get these types of cookies, I bake in the oven on the Convection Baking setting at 375.  I bake one pan at a time, for 9 minutes. I take them out when they look a little raw in the middle and just start to be golden on the outside.  

After taking them out of the oven, I slam the cookie sheet on the counter.  This makes the goo settle. I then carefully place them on a baking rack to cool thoroughly.  People have raved that they are the best chocolate cookies they have ever tasted! I agree...

This is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe ever! They are especially good when served warm. I really like how they are crispy on the outside, yet soft and chewy on the inside. I always use just 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 2 cups. Sometimes what I like to do with the dough is make something I call a panookie...all you do is divide the dough into 8 pieces and press the dough into 8 greased 4 inch mini pie tins then bake them for about 20 minutes then serve hot right out of the oven with a scoop of ice cream. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

The first time I made these, they turned out too hard. I had tried several different chocolate chip cookie recipes before realizing my mistake. The center of the cookies is supposed to be soft when it comes out of the oven. Don't wait till it gets hard otherwise the cookies will be overcooked. The center hardens as it cools on the rack. I'm glad I made these again. They were crispy, thinned just right, tender, delicate and slightly chewy. Will keep this one.

I have been making these for years and love them! To avoid "flat" cookies, be sure to refrigerate the dough for 20-60 minutes prior to baking. Also suggest mixing half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet chips - YUM!

Certainly noThing like the cookies I made when I was 10, too soft as if undercooked, I looked closely and some of the sugar granules were still there! hadn't melted. choc chips sink too much making the cookie look like a plain cookie, the taste is sweet but that is it, just a sweet cookie. I think Friends made these famous!!! which is more than likely why soo many people rave about them, deep down they are below average for a choc chip cookie. I like a hard or crispy cookie like my old recipe was that I lost, those ones used to stay pretty light in colour and the chips would stay at the top and the cookie would be cooked right through, like a store bought one.. Not ones that feel like cake and a horrible brown shade. If you want them to look like the picture then you would have to open the oven half way through cooking and drop some more chips on top. Overall, fairly dissapointing so am still in search of a decent choc chip cookie recipe.I made these twice, once with butter, once with butter and shortening. The butter ones turned out a bit better as they went flatter so more chips could be seen, do not use shortening as they stay a bit higher and the chips drop.

I'm just 15 years old now but I can safely say that this is really the best cookie recipe ever! My mom doesn't get vanillia extract, but oddly enough, they still turn out perfect without it. On the other hand, our cooking class at school did the same recipie, and when we used the vanillia extract, they turned out all flat. If you like really soft and gooey cookies, try putting the dough in the fridge for a 1/2 hour before shaping and baking, and just bake for 7-8 minutes, they're so perfect, all my friends love them :)

At Epcot in Disney World, the Land Pavilion is hosted by Nestle and you can buy the Orginal cookies there (in grand size no less!).  My family always has to splurge for these treats whenever we visit.  Making them at home, we are always happy with the results.  Try the milk chocolate morsels, too, because they are great!

I grew up with this recipe. For all those whiners that think it failed because it is flat, that's the way it supposed to be! The chips and the nuts make wonderful bumps in them. Don't add a bunch of other junk like instant pudding to these, these are the real deal. If you want a fluffy chewy cookie, use a different recipe. But if you ask me, this one is perfect as is!!

This is the exact recipe off the bag of Nestle Toll House chocolate chips bag. I LOVE this recipe! I have always used butter instead of margarine as it makes the cookies more soft, and less crispy, in my opinion. After learning to make breakfast this was the first recipe I ever attempted. No matter how many chocolate chip cookie recipes I have tried this one is always my favorite. I couldn't begin to guess how many times I have made this recipe. For even shaped cookies I always use a cookie scoop. I also bake them on parchment and take them out 1-2 minutes early and they stay soft even the next day or two. This recipes is and will always be a "classic!"

To make these taste good, you have to refrigerate the dough for about 10 min and add 1/2t nutmeg and 1/2t cinnamon, but they still come out cakey.  Also, do not, DO NOT, use margarine, or Smart Balance, I Can't Believe it's not Butter, ext, the dough comes out more like batter and the cookies come out rubbery and too buttery.

This is the chocolate chip cookie recipe my family has used for as long as I can remember.  We make a couple small changes to ensure nice, puffy, chewy cookies:  First, we reduce the amount of fat by 25% (so, instead of 1 cup, we use 3/4 cup).  Second, we use half shortening and half butter (6 Tbs of butter and 6 Tbs of shortening).  I usually omit the nuts, but that's only because I rarely have them on hand.

As I grew up (and to this day, actually), my mom would make these cookies.  She liked to add a little orange juice and sometimes some dried cranberries.  On the occasions that they did not come out burnt, they were always very good.  I on the other hand have come up with a few variations of my own that have always gone over very well.  I like to use a little extra vanilla extract, a generous pinch of pumpkin pie spice, chopped up baking chocolate bars instead of chips (to avoid getting melted chocolate all over your hands when chopping, you can either wear gloves or put the bars in a plastic bag and beat them with a meat tenderizer), and lately I've been using some bagged caramel pieces.  I usually end up omitting the nuts, but in the event that I use them, I end up making candied pecans and using those instead.  If you use the caramel, adding a little extra salt balances nicely.  I always use coarse sea salt for a little more texture.  These cookies are absolutely classic in every sense of the word and they're an awesome canvas for a little experimentation.

I was disappointed with this recipe. Too flat and crispy for my taste.

As always a fantastic cookie. I personally prefer 1/2 stick of butter and 3/4 cup of shortening. Makes for a puffier cookie. Thank you for having this recipe on my favorite site.

These are the best cookies I have ever made! I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortning as previously suggested. I also used a little extra vanilla, 16 oz of chocolate chips, and put the dough in the fridge before cooking. I will definately make these again!!

Follow the directions prescribed here. But, I have two recommendations. One, you better have an electric mixer. Two, use two large bowls: one for dry ingredients, one for butter/sugar/egg mixture. Without this, good luck..... It's not a simple recipe to make in less than 10mins if you're using a whisk or wooden spoon. But don't get me wrong, it's worth the effort to make this recipe since the end result is a tasty, delicious snack.

This recipe gets a 5 for being the best recipe out there.  However, DO NOT USE MARGARINE.  I don't know who could ever make a successful cookie using margarine.  It's a classic rule of cookie-baking: there's just not enough fat in margarine.  Butter or Crisco is the only way to go.  If you have to use margarine, make sure your grease your cookie sheet.  I also recommend doubling the vanilla, though I don't think adding cinnamon makes any difference.

Best recipe ever! I usually have the flat problem (thinking it was just by bad skills at baking) but after reading some of your suggestions, I'm going to try putting the dough in the fridge before putting it on the cookie sheet. Everyone I make this for loves the cookie despite the flatness. I make these without nuts and I use milk chocolate and white chocolate swirl chips. Yum yum yum!

No other chocolate chip recipe gratifies my taste buds like this one does!  I remember my mother used to bake these for us a little more than a decade ago.  Brings back memories!  I added a tsp of baking powder to keep them from getting flat.

My husband was begging for cookies and the only reason I made these cookies is because I only had 3/4 cup of brown sugar and not the full cup my recipe calls for. So I grabbed my bag of chips and began mixing according to the directions on the back. They spread very quick and were flat with a cakey consistency on the inside. The second pan turned out the same, so I used the rest of the batter to make cupcakes and put chocolate frosting on them. Next time, if I don't have everything I need, the boys will just have to wait.

I doubled this recipe, but ended up adding more flour because they were sooo flat!  I didn't make any other changes except for leaving out the nuts.  They were very tasty, but just a little on the flat side.  I'll probably try these again.

My Nana was an experienced baker. And this was the only chocolate chip cookie recipe she would ever use. She said they were the best. Make sure your butter (use real butter) and eggs are at room temperature. Double the vanilla and chill for at least an hour. And let them rest on the cookie sheet after baking until they firm up. Perfect every time!

Toll House - the best!  To keep your cookies from running flat, always cool your dough for a good hour before baking and keep the dough in the fridge between batches.  The colder the cookie dough, the higher the cookies bake up.

This has been a family classic...but I accidentally discovered a new way to do it.  I prefer to use butter instead of the margarine, and one time changed my mind (mid-process) from a half batch to full batch, and so only used half the butter, but the same amount of all the other ingredients.  I also only use brown sugar to get a chewier batch, and they turned out perfectly!  No more flat cookies that look like they melted all over the place, and no more "hollow" cookies where the insides were left all over the spatula.

Wow...finally I made some amazing cookies! I did go (mostly) by the recipe, but I love to gather other peoples comments...it always pays off! I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder, 1 packet of the instant vanilla pudding, an extra heaping tsp of vanilla, cut back to 1/4 c of sugar and 2/4 c of brown sugar (due to the pudding packet)and lastly 1/2 tsp of baking soda! I also hand mixed the flour! I refridgerated the dough 15 minutes. So, thank you to those reviewers who take the time to add in your own talent and experience!

I grew up making these cookies! They are the BEST! We used to make them with the mint chocolate chips and they were soooo delicious. I haven't been able to find them for years unfortunately.
I now live in New Zealand and I buy Nestle Toll House chocolate chips whenever I'm home specifically to make these cookies. I usually bake them for a minute or two less than what is recommended. Also, make sure the butter is not melted, just soft. If it is melted, the cookies are much more likely to be flat.
Everyone here LOVES them! My boyfriend thinks they're better than any store bought cookies and my friends specifically request them!

I use this as a base for many of my cookie recipes.  I omit the nuts and use different types of chocolate chips and flavors of extract sometimes.  A winner EVERY TIME.

Perfect cookie all around. I like to use ghiradelli dark chocolate morsels (ironic, 'cos the recipe is nestle toll house) but any other choc. chips work fine. Made these on several occasions and they have turned out perfect every single time. Just follow the recipe exactly. Looking for a recipe to tweak? Look somewhere else :)

These cookies were good - I halved the recipe and followed it exactly but replaced Baking Powder with the Baking Soda.  The cookies took about 14min in the oven, they were crunchy around the edges, and perhaps I should have added more flour like the other review suggested, because the dough consistency didn't seem complete.  I wanted to add vanilla pudding mix, but it increases the sweetness of the cookie twofold! And I've tried baking cookies with less sugar and the vanilla pudding mix - but those cookies don't turn out brown!  If your cookies don't turn out brown, its because you didnt' add enough sugar.  So I currently have no idea how to get around this - add enough sugar to make them brown but not too much so I still have room to add vanilla pudding mix.  Maybe next time I can add HALF a packet of pudding mix - that would still make a difference, no?  Love the pudding mix - the cookies really do come out softer, chewier, and puffier.

Every one loved these cookies. They were gone in minutes. I baked them in a mini muffin tray and they came out perfect. I omitted the nuts. I was requested to make these again for a birthday party, definitely a keeper.

I've been making Nestle Toll House cookies like this for years.  I like to add 2 cups of chopped fresh cranberries to the cookies for the holiday season.  The slight sour cuts the sweet of the chocolate chips nicely, although they come out a bit sticky this way.

I've been making this awesome recipe for years! Secret to a soft chewy cookie is refrigerate your dough at least 2 hours. I usually do it overnight. Cold dough into a hot oven = soft chewy yummy cookie.
If you like a crunchier cookie bake dough at room temp. No need to change the recipe.

AMAZING! I followed some reviewers' tips and used 2 tsp. vanilla extract as well as 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. I used half a package of semi-sweet morsels, half a package of white chocolate morsels, a handful of crushed Hershey kisses leftover from Halloween, and a cup of pecans. They were fantastic! Easily the best cookies I've ever made!

first time i tried this it was very delicious.  i doubled the recipe cuz our family is big. and i also changed some measurements.  quick question tho is baking soda bicarbonate of soda? because i didnt add that i added baking powder which made it cakey but still chewy :) crunch edges too.
what i did was i added 1cup butter and 1 cup margarine, only 1tsp salt, no nuts, and 400g chocolate chips (200 milk, 100g dark, 100g white) and the whole recipe made by hand! no machine

but what didnt happen was it did not hold its shape even after i froze it! they came together into one big blob..so with the remaining mixture i put it in sandwich pans and made pan cookies (make sure to line the pans with baking paper because i didnt with my 1st pan and it stuck :) 

great recipe tho! will make again for sure..

I've made these cookies forever, getting the original recipe off the bag of chips, even have it pasted in my original cookbook. I follow the recipe exactly. Use unsalted butter. If I don't add nuts I just add extra chips. Every once in awhile I stray off and try another recipe but always come back to this one. I make sure my butter and eggs are room temperature and really cream the butter and sugars well...for a good three minutes. Mix the chips in by hand. I use a stone to cook my cookies and never have a problem with burnt bottoms. I alternate between two pans so that one is cooled off enough, or else the cookie will start to spread and be flat.

This was the first time i made this recipe, personally all chocolate chip cookies taste the same to me so these were great. However, i used whole wheat flour which usually makes things more dry so to help that i added an extra 1/4 stick of butter. they came out way too flat and they kept burning for the first couple cookies sheets, but as i let the dough sit longer it like hardened up or something and they came out fine. I think the temp. is a little high so maybe bump it down to 350 if your having the same problem.

These were one of the first things I ever cooked/baked by myself! They are very good, however I noticed that the cook time was usually more than 11 minutes. No matter the cooking time, these cookies are certainly delicious!

I started making this recipe about 3 years ago, my husband and kids LOVE them, they are the best chocolate chip cookies. I take mine out a minute or two early and let them finish on the pan so they are soft. These are my "specialty" :)

i added one box of chocolate pudding mix so they were like double chocolate chip cookies. vanilla pudding mix would be better if you just want chocolate chip cookies. I added an extra tsp vanilla extract and 1tsp water. I didn't add the nuts either (i didn't have any) I also replaced sugar with splenda so it came out to 60 calories per cookie :)

I've made these cookies numerous times and they turn out well.  I halved the salt, increased the flour by three TBSP. and doubled the vanilla.  While it's not my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe, it's definitely good.  In case you want to know, my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe can be found in a book entitled, Dessert University, which is authored by a former White House pastry chef.  Those chocolate chip cookies ROCK!

These always come out flat and greasy.  I know they are classic, but there's way better cookie recipes out there.  Mel's Magnificent Chocolate Chip Cookies is one I always fall back to.

This is our family's favorite chocolate chip cookie!  We enjoy a softer cookie though, so I add an extra 1/2 C flour.  Also, not big nut fans so I always skip those.  Bake for 9-10 minutes and take out of the oven before they look done.  Allow to sit on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes before moving cookies from baking sheet to a rack to cool.  Also I love using my Silpat silicone baking mats...they make a great cookie and make clean up a breeze.  Enjoy!

Timeless recipe!! Like many others, my mom loved baking these for my sisters and I when we were kids but when it came time for ME to do the baking, it didn't turn out right. I add half the salt and I use half a cup of crisco and half a cup of butter (never margarine) when making these. I have yet to try the instant pudding idea but I will give it a go the next time I make cookies!!

Best cookie recipe ever. I use (depending on weather) up to 3 cups of flour. Typicall is about 2 2/3 cup flour. It helps the cookies not spread out when you bake them and allows them to stay really chewy. Its a simple "fix" without having to use 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening. Enjoy great times making awesome cookies together as a family!

make as bars, spread in 15x10inch pan and bake 20-25 minutes.  absolutely the best thing you will ever do for yourself.  AMAZING.  Also, sometimes I do half white chocolate chips....and have done all whole wheat flour, still amazing!

This is the only chocolate chip recipe in my opinion.  I increase the flour to 2-2/3 cup from 2-1/4 and then I get a perfect cookie.  I don't like them flat.

For people concerned about flat cookies the solution is simple -- add more flour than the recipe calls for, form the cookie into a ball, and chill it sufficiently before baking. I guarantee your cookies will not be flat.

These are by far the best chocolate chip cookies I've had!!.. The first time I baked these, I did it as the recipe asked. They were great! But I read some reviews and they mentioned to add a vanilla pudding mix!! Oh my!! :) one helpfull tip that helped me is to use parchment paper.

This is only getting 4 stars because it is my sisters favorite...  I ALWAYS get flat cookies when I make this, but my sister does not!  This time i even froze the dough and they came out so flat!  I followed everything in the recipe but leave out the nuts!  I don't over mix or mess up in any other way. I know a lot of you have said how strange it is for people to have these cookies turn out flat, but it is true.  I bake a lot and have found other cookie recipes that have better results, and I wish these had those results.  This is my favorite dough  of all of the recipes I have tried (and I have tried it countless times) but it never works.  I'm going to try to add some more flour to the last batch to see what happens, hopefully it works!

I used a mix of half bread flour and half all purpose, for a chewy, but not too chewy texture. Perfectly crisp edges, gooey center.

Oh WOW! My search for the ultimate chocolate chip cookie is finally over!! This is without a doubt IT. It is tender, chewy, not too rich or sweet, perfect texture and taste. My whole family unanimously agreed that this was the very best chocolate chip cookie I've ever made, and I have made loooootttts of different recipes! Thank you so much for posting this recipe, I don't think I would have found it here in Canada, I don't remember ever seeing Nestle Toll House packages here. Thank you, thank you!!

This has been a family classic since I was a little girl. Sometimes we add black walnuts, sometimes english walnuts, and sometimes no nuts at all. For a chocolate cholate chip cookie, just add 1/4 cup of cocoa.
I always shake my chips in a baggie of flour so they will be distrubuted throughout the cookie, and not all sink to the bottom. Refrigerate the dough for at least an hour prior to baking, and in between the baking.

I've always made my cookies with this recipe and they've always been great. My trick is I pull them out when the edges are light brown and centers are still soft, and then I let them cool right on the pan, they stay soft much longer this way... Especially if you keep them in something air tight. I recently tried this recipe with SPLENDA, tasted great still but a more crumbly cookie. I also found that the splenda made the dough less likely to melt out flat on the pan, so I had to roll the cookie balls in my hand and press them onto the pan to make them look nice after baking.

I've made these quite a few times over the last 2 years.  They turn out different depending on whether the batter is stirred slightly, beat, left to sit, put in the fridge for awhile, or put in the freezer.  Find out what works for you!  When you do, you'll be thrilled with the result.  I always make extra and freeze in balls to bake a couple at a time when needed.  (Otherwise, I eat the whole pan.)

I used baking M&Ms instead of semi-sweet choc chips. Also added 2 tsps zested orange just because I like the hint of orange in my cookies. These cookies came out huge and taste good!

I've made these cookies for years and my grandmother before me. These are perfect if you follow the recipe correctly providing for differences in (oven thermostats and altitude of course.) If you want to try some of the additions and substitutions there's nothing wrong with that of course. That said these turn perfect as is. I do chill the dough before baking and keep in fridge in between batches. Other than that the only thing I ever change is the nuts. Sometimes I feel like some nuts sometimes I don't.

Perfect every time! I substitute 1/2 cup shortening for 1/2 c of the butter, lightly sprinkle sea salt on them as soon as they come out of the oven, and make sure your pans are cool when dropping dough on them! No more flat cookies! The shortening really helps, as butter melts faster than shortening.

I have made this so many times! It is awsome! I would recommend this to everyone! There are some changes i make though, like more vanilla, and no nuts in it, then use 1 1/2 cups each of butterscotch AND chocolate chips. It's really good, and my sister always forces me to make them.

I like a crisp cookie with a soft middle.  These were just soft. Taste ok but not as I remember them, something seems to be missing.  I doubled the recipe and used butter.  I did not chill the batter. Any suggestions?

i made it only for the dough, (i was bored ok?? xD ) and i found that if your just going to eat the dough, you should leave out the baking soda. i followed the directions (except i hand-mixed everything) and i got a big lump of the dough on a spoon, put it in my mouth and almost spit it out... it tasted sour and salty. i added almost a cup more of sugar but it didnt help. so i suggest, if your as crazy as i am, :) to leave out the baking soda if your just going to eat the cookie dough. otherwise, it tastes ok. im just eating it by the spoonful right now :)

If you want...SOFT and CAKEY: 
Use 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter and reduce brown sugar to 1/2 cup. Proportionally in the recipe, there is now more flour, which contributes to a cakey texture. To keep them cakey for longer, store them in an airtight container.
SOFT AND CHEWEY: 
Reduce granulated sugar to 1/2 cup and increase brown sugar to 1 cup. Increasing the brown sugar will produce a softer and chewier cookie because brown sugar has higher moisture content than granulated sugar. To keep your cookies soft and chewy for longer, store them in an airtight container, but not with crisp cookies.
THIN AND CRISPY: 
Increase butter to 1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) and increase granulated sugar to 1 1/4 cups. Increasing the butter and sugar will cause the cookies to bake up flatter, therefore, crispier!
PUFFY AND FLUFFY: 
Reduce butter to 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup solid vegetable shortening. To keep your cookies puffier for longer, store them in an airtight container, but not with crispy cookies.

I've made these a million times but I ALWAYS have to alter the recipe so that they don't end up being incredibly flat.  I I followed the recipe by accident this past Christmas and like I said, they are flatter than a pancake.

I love this recipe!!  I have been making it for years.  To keep the cookies from getting too flat, refrigerate them for an hour or so before cooking and put into round balls on the cookie sheet and don't flatten them out.

For those who like to use healthy alt., this is a very flexible recipe.  I have been able to substitute part of the all purpose flour for things such as: flax seed meal, spelt,amaranth,qunioa,sprouted grain, etc.  Cocao nibs add a great nut like crunch. I tried chai seeds today. They don't really have any flavor, but they do add nutrition. I also sub. half the butter for coconut oil.  One thing I really don't like is adding brown rice flour.  Too me the texture is a little to gritty and crumbly.

I love these cookies they are so delish. I have been making these since I was 8. A side note: Peanut butter cups are a delicious subsitute or you can just mix them with the chocolate chips. Both ways are to die for.

Of all the chocolate chip cookie recipes I have tried on this site, these are so far my favorite. Absolutely love them!! I prefer my chocolate chip cookies more flat as opposed to big and fat, and that is one of the reasons I like these so much. I follow the recipe exactly as is and they turn out wonderful every time!! Thanks for sharing:)

It could be my irregularly-heating oven, but these cookies looked dark on top when I took them out, but they ended up being super soft - too soft to actually be a 'cookie shape'.  But it still tastes delicious, and we used them as cookie crumbles over ice cream!

Very good.  My husband likes crispy cookies, while my children like soft cookies.  These were on the soft side.  I might try to cook them a minute or two longer to see if they are more to my husband's liking.

I didn't particularly like these, but they were OK.  They came out too flat.  I added chopped hazelnuts to half of the batch, and they were tasty.  I won't be making this recipe again though.

You can not go wrong with this classic recipe. My only complaint is the cookies always go a little flat, but the taste reminds me of being a kid again.

If you like 'fluffy' cookies, then this is the recipe for you.  I use half peanut butter chips and half chocolate chips, plus add about 1/2 cup of walnut pieces.  

I usually chill the mixed dough before putting on the pan, as this results in fluffier cookies somehow.  Also, I just make one pan at a time, keeping the dough in the fridge for another day as these cookies are just DIVINE when fresh out of the oven.

I just got married a few weeks ago and decided to take a stab at making chocolate chip cookies for my husband since he loves them.  He tried these and he cannot stop raving about them, he told me he likes them better than his mom's version. (WOW!)  I took other reviewers suggestions and cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup then added a packet of vanilla pudding. I also put in one stick of butter to make it a bit heathier.  I also kept all my ingredients at room temperature, which helped to keep the cookies from going flat, plus they stay so nice and chewy.  All in all this recipe is fantastic and it will be my new go to cookie recipe.

Quite good. You MUST reduce the salt amount. I used half the salt amount and still thought it might be a bit too much. I added a bit more vanilla than the T as others suggested. It was a yummy cookie. Will be using again. I used margrine and worked out fine.

The best chocolate chip cookie recipe! Some advice though, always add 1/4 cup additional flour. This helps to prevent flattened cookies. Don't add instant pudding, don't refrigerate the dough, just add 1/4 cup more flour.

This recipe has been my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe for my entire life.  I substitute oatmeal for the nuts sometimes for a change, but that is the only change I would ever suggest.

Delicious
Only thing is half the batch turned out a lot nicer than the other! I found that using an insulated pan, the cookies spread a lot nicer and even like where as a nonstick regular pan made domeshaped/sharper/thin edged cookies. Also it worked better when I dropped them and simply left it as is, then working it into a ball and slightly flattening.

I accidently used 1 stick of butter,  so it was only half cup instead of the  one called for.  They were good but more like cake than a cookie.  Make sure you double check your measurements.  I think if I had used the correct amount of butter they would have been exceptional and easy to make!

Mine came out super flat. I did halve the recipe so I may have screwed something up. Hmmmm...I've made the tollhouse recipe before. They still taste good. I may crumple them up and put them on ice cream.

Excellent stand-by recipe to use. I live in Colorado and have made a few adjustments for the high-altitude/dry climate, after this the cookies turned out even better!  1. Increase flour to 3 cups (sounds like a lot but I've tried several increments, this one works the best.) 2. Decrease salt to 1/2 tsp. 3. Increase vanilla to 2-3 tsp. (Enhances flavor) 4. Decrease white sugar only to 2/3 cup instead of 3/4, leave brown sugar at 3/4 cup. (When baking at high altitude, sugar tends to make a flatter, more spread out cookie, this alteration will provide a thicker, chewier cookie) 4. Add a teaspoon of water WITH the flour. (Helps cookies stay moist when storing) 5. Increase baking temp. to 385 degrees.  Also, it could just be my oven, but the bottoms of the cookies always seem to brown faster than the tops, so I move the oven rack from the middle position to the one above it.

Tasty and chewy cookies! I recommend decreasing the sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 cup based on your preferences, as this is a pretty sweet cookie. I used chopped walnuts. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I followed the recipe closely, only using whole wheat white flour and milk chocolate chips, because that was all I had on hand. This is literally the perfect chocolate chip cookie. The bowl that held the cookie dough was even licked clean by my husband. NOTE: I didn't get even close to 60 servings worth of cookies. I got about 40 cookies from this whole batch and they were medium sized.

I love this recipe!  I cookies come out best if I refrigerate the dough before baking.  I always use real butter, and I usually roll the dough into balls and refrigerate before baking.  Then I pop them in a preheated oven for 9 minutes and the come out perfect -- crispy on the outside and tender in the middle.

Would have been 5 stars except for the consistency of the dough. I've made enough chocolate chip cookies to know that made as per the instructions, this cookie dough is way too soft.  It's almost to the point of being soupy.  I added about 4-5 tbsp. of flour just to get it right.  I think refrigerating it would have made some difference, but not enough.  Other than that, the recipe is perfect!  Some people were saying to omit 1/2 of the salt, but I did not do that.  I think that you need a good amount of salt in any dessert recipe, esp. when including chocolate, because it brings out the flavor.  It isn't too much.

Best chocolate chip recipe out there. I used wheat flour and only 1/2 cup of brown and white sugar. The is the only recipe I would use. (Add an extra 1/4 cup of flour for fluffier cookies)

EXCELLENT recipe!  This has always been our favorite chocolate chip cookie.  Because I usually buy the large bag and keep the chips in a canister, I was happy to find written on the bag that there are 2 cups of chips in a 12 oz. bag.  I left the nuts out because that is the way we like them.  The baking time is perfect.   This recipe has been in my life for as long as I can remember.  Thank you Nestle for an EXCELLENT recipe!

A good, classic recipe. They consistantly turn out delicious! However, I omit the nuts. I usually also use half a cup of normal butter and half a cup of margine, and I add about one-eighth a cup of flour. It makes the cookies alot less greasy.

As always, the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie. There is no other recipe allowed in my house, and in my opinion, there shouldn't be any other recipe allowed anywhere. Perfect every time. My tips - I use half butter and half crisco (regular, not butter flavored), I add an extra 1/2 tsp of salt, and at the beginning, really whip the snot out of the butter/sugar mixture...

these cookies tasted great, but spread out way too thin during baking and had holes where the chocolate chips melted. I added and extra 1/4 cup flour and they came out perfect.

These cookies were okay. I have made better with other recipes from this site. The taste was spot on for these but the appearance not so much. Flat cookies I got from this recipe even tho I followed the recipe to a T.

This is a 5 star recipe only if you like SUPER FLAT cookies. I dont like flat cookies so i'd only give this recipe 1 star. If your like me and you like puffy, chewy, fat cookies.. this is what you need to do... add 3/4 cup flour (so it'll be 3 level cups total.) Use butter-flavored crisco instead of butter and use baking powder instead of baking soda!! One more thing Omit the nuts in chocolate chip cookies. Either just use all chocolate chips or all m&m's.

This recipe is great, and to make it even better (it's possible!) I make just a few small changes.  I like to cut down the butter to 3/4 of what the recipe calls, and I add some Disaronno liqueur (1 tsp to 4 tsp depending how I'm feeling), and add more flour to "compensate" for the added moisture from the Disaronno - usually 1/2 cup per batch.  I omit the nuts, too.  The cookies have a nice rustic taste to them this way, and they turn out fluffy every time.  My family, my boyfriend, and my boyfriend's family absolutely love them!

I was a skeptic when I saw people talking about adding the pudding packet, but I am a beliver they actually are fluffy not flat. I also used half butter crisco and half of butter, doubled the vanilla, decreased the salt to 1/2, and used baking powder instead of the baking soda, I also only used 1/4 white sugar and made the rest brown sugar, whoever put this recipe on the site, my husband thanks you! I no longer have brown flat cookies.

Best cookie recipe ever. You can modify easily. I recommend keeping the brown/white sugar ratio and slightly thawing the butter. Note in the original recipe the nuts are optional but they are better with. You can also use this with mm's and even cut in oatmeal. Also, the type of baking sheet will influence taste for better or worse.

Wonderful classic recipe.  Make sure your ingredients are at room temperature. I usually omit the nuts and refrigerate the dough before baking.  It makes the cookies come out extra fluffy.  Plus, then I only make a single cookie sheet at a time because otherwise we would eat all of the cookies.

Hey what can we say about this long standing American classic other than P E R F E C T... I suppose I could venture off on to another version like soft baked or just for the heck of it try one of the thousands of other Chocolate Chip Cookie recipes out there but this single recipe has kept me quite satisfied for decades I must admit. I'll let you know if I come across anything better...

I really don't get why some people had flat cookies. I have made this recipe countless times and I have never once had flat cookies. I just follow the recipe, and I get perfect, chocolately cookies that everyone seems to love! The only thing that I do change in this recipe is the chopped nuts. I usually leave them out.

I took the advice of others as well- froze the cookie dough, used half margarine and half butter. Also put in way more vanilla than it called for. 8 minutes is the way to go. They came out just fluffy enough with a fantastic taste. My fiance can't get enough. This time made two batches- one with chocolate chips and then another with Reeces chips. Those are now his favorite cookie!

I make these cookies all the time, and they're super easy. Plus, you can get five dozen cookies out of one batch! My best trick is to cream the butter/sugar/vanilla mixture by hand with a fork until it's perfectly blended, and then I add the eggs one at a time. I also make sure to add the flour a little bit at a time. With my insulated cookie sheets, these always come out perfectly golden brown around the edges while still a little soft in the middle. Yummy!

Now, I know I am no Betty Crocker, but I followed this recipe to a tee except for decreasing the chocolate a bit, and the first batch came out super flat and didn't have much flavor.  So I added more flour, more sugar and more chocolate chips and the rest of them were OKAYYY but nothing to rave about.  These make for a very flat cookie, nothing like the picture, and they lack the chewiness I was looking for.  My neighbor described them as "light, kinda airy, different"(but had no problem downing them anyway).  I will continue to search for the perfect chewy chocolate chip cookie recipe...

Here's what I did different, a teensy bit less baking soda, used 3 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs, threw in a handful of quick oats, and I toasted the pecans before using them.  I will use more than a cup of nuts next time though.  I also used unsalted butter and melted over the lowest heat so not to separate it.  Cooked them exactly 8 minutes on a shiny cookie sheet, not airbake.  I sent a huge load to work with my fiancee, and he was calling within 15 minutes, telling me the girls were raving about them.

I have made chocolate chip cookies from this recipe for many years. My mother-in-law (84 years)said I make the best chocolate chip cookies she has ever had. I have tried quite a few different recipes for choc. chip cookies but I always come back to this one.  I judge all homemade cookies by this recipe and none cam compare.

These cookies were a big hit.  I used Ghiardelli milk chocolate chips, as that's what I had onhand.  I forgot to add nuts and they were still awesome!  I made one cookie sheet full, then froze the rest of the dough in balls.  It was SO easy to pop a few cookies in the toaster oven later.

Super cookies, as always. I had to make a few changes, living in the Netherlands. Choc chips are a scarce commodity, so I used the "puur" (semi-sweet) chocolate bars, refrigerated then smashed into chunks in a plastic bag using a hammer. Had to be careful not to smash them TOO much, or you just get flakes of chocolate. 
I guess you can say I made chocolate chunk cookies with this rather than chocolate chip, but the folks here rave about 'em and I get my fix of classic American treats.

1.23.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/39781/original-nestle-toll-house-chocolate-chip-cookies/ ... Add a half to threefourths cup more flour & your flatness problem is solved.  I add oats instead of the nuts.  You can get away with less chips if you use minis, too.  NOTE:  Use 2 3/4 - 3 c flour.  Add 1c rolled oats.  Refrigerate overnight to have oats soften.  Bake 10 - 12.  1c minis or 1 1/2c regular size chips.  Bag is 2c regular size. SPIDER CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES: Just from the oven, use a toothpick to draw legs with the chips while they are still warm.

i give it 5 stars as it is written.  you do have to make sure you put the dough back in fridge to set up or it will run everywhere.  Also, don't put dough on a hot cookie sheet either, it will run.  This recipe needs an extra 1/2 cup of flour.  i have used this recipe for 20 years with the extra 1/2 cup of flour and that way they don't end up flat.

I use this recipe all of the time.  There is nothing wrong with the recipe.  The cookies, and the batter consistency, depend on if your butter is melted. You must use soft, room temp butter that is not melted and you must mix it adding the flour mixture gradually.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe around, but only when done right. I've made a lot of bad batches with this recipe, and they STILL sometimes turn out bad, but when they're right they're right. 

I make sure to take my butter and eggs out and sit on the counter overnight. DO NOT melt the butter like some people suggest. Your dough will be dark, greasy, and lumpy. 

I add an extra egg yolk on top of two whole large eggs. 

Take my advice and DO NOT refrigerate this dough. Again, your dough will be dark and greasy if it sits too long. Make the cookies right away.

I found that using a stone sheet is the best. 

Scoop a SMALL amount of dough out with a spoon and slide it onto the sheet. Not too big or it won't cook right. Make sure the dollop is high and not flattened in any way. 

As for time, I try to take them out when the edges are brown, even if the middle looks wet. They'll continue baking on the hot sheet anyways. This usually happens at around 9 minutes, but sometimes they have to be left in until 11 minutes. 

Good luck!

Good basic recipe, I would amend it if I made it again though. Less baking soda (they were too cakey for me), and 1/2tsp more vanilla extract. Thanks!!

This is my favorite cookie recipe!!!  Don't use any substitutions.  I ran out of brown sugar one time an substituted white sugar for the brown sugar and I was shocked at the difference the brown sugar made in the recipe.  I also double the vanilla in the recipe and I use real butter (so necessary)!

This is the gold standard  for chocolate chip cookies recipe. Everyone's mom made this recipe. Make sugar your eggs and butter are at room tempture for best results. If you like your cookie even more chewy then change the white sugar to 1/4 a cup. Right before I put in the chocolate chips, I add one small package of instant vanilla pudding, then bake as recipe states.

I loved this recipe!  I doubled the vanilla like someone else had suggested, and I have to say that I liked the fact that they were flatter than other recipes I've tried on here.  They didn't puff up and get that "cakey" texture that other recipes did.  Will definitely try again!

I reduced the butter to one stick as recommended by another reviewer. These turned out great! They weren't flat or greasy. I was thrilled with the results! A little less guilt when eating 2 instead of just one!

I have been using recipe for years and it is by far the BEST!  I first made them when I was in High School and have never found another recipe that is as good. My family absolutely loves them.  To ensure a soft chewey cookie know your oven's temperature. And watch the time.  Usually best to remove from the oven when they just start to brown.

Good job on all the ingrediants! My great-great-Grandma is the original woman who came up with this. we own the actual recipe, but we gave it to the world!--Such a gift!! (And of course, I rated it 5 stars, LOVED IT. Because old granny was such a good cook, but I think a little gaga when it comes to anything else)

AMAZING! I used mini chocolate chips and filled the centers with Nutella Hazelnut Spread- they were gone in 5 seconds! The cookies baked very evenly and were soft in the center and crispy on the ends. Also, they weren't too sweet, and more savory, which made them perfect for being paired with the Nutella!

This was a great chocolate chip cookie recipe! I made a few chewy, but I baked some a bit over the given time and they ended up crunchy, and everyone still loved them! :) I used half butter - half vegetable shortening, and it was fine that way. I also didn't add any nuts. 

This is my new go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe! Simple, easy and delicious! :D

There are a couple of suggestions that may help with your thin cookie problem.
1)Set your oven setting to fan heat. This helps makes the cookies stay plump.
2)When any cookie recipe asks for butter make sure the butter is creamy and not melted. If your working with refrigerated butter, simply put the butter in the microwave 30 seconds or less depending on how many watts your microwave has, then stir it until creamy. 
I hope this information helps.. Happy Baking :D

This is the ONLY recipe for Chocolate Chip Cookies I ever use. Everyone in my family LOVES my cookies. My Sister owns a Restaurant and I do the baking for her. She has brunches on some Sundays and this is her big request! Here are some changes I made: I add milk chocolate chips along with semi-sweet chips (I add more chips than the recipe calls for). I also add more than a cup of walnuts. We like a crisp cookie so I squash each cookie and bake it for a total of 10 minutes. They are perfect, yummy, delicious, and addicting!!!

I followed the recipe exactly (although I also added some butterscotch chips) and my cookies turned out more cakey than the picture.  They were still tasty, but they were not what I was hoping.  I will not make these again.  It seemed like too much of the wet batter and not enough of the flour mixture.

My cookies turned out flat (probably due to bad oven), and they were not all that flavoursome. The recipe also does not yield as many cookies as it stated. I changed serving size to 30 and got 12 cookies out of it.

This recipe is perfect!!!  I just used the recipe and my cookies are crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The flavor is exceptional.  No changes to the recipe for me.

Was very unsure why anyone in the world would alter such a perfect recipe..but after reading several reviews, I think I am going to try making a batch with a sm. packet of vanilla instant pudding mix mixed in and only use half the white sugar, and maybe even substitute half the butter for crisco...I will let you all know how it turns out! The original recipe is definitly a 5 star recipe, just wondering if I can make it a little thicker! We will see!

I used three cups of mixed chocolate instead of chocolate chips and nuts. White, Milk and dark chocolate. These are delicious! Definitely a keeper :)

No other cookie seems to come out more moist than this one. Same thing when my mom cooks them, she generally makes really good cookies, but when she uses this recipe they come out perfect every time. Moist, chewy and gooey, mmm I want to make another batch right now haha. Oh and ignore the vegan thing in my name, it was just an experiment I was on for 6 months.

An ok basic choc chip cookie, kinda boring though. It was too .... what's the right word... cakey? dry? I prefer my choc chip cookies to have that little crisp on the edge and be chewy in the middle. If that's what you're looking for, add some sugar.

Maybe I am a cookie snob, but I wasn't a huge fan of these.  They were good....but not AWESOME.   This is the recipe on the back of many choc chip bags.  Good...don't get me wrong, but nothing to write home about.

I had only 1 cup of mini chocolate chips so I had to scale down the recipe to 2/3. These cookies are fantastic! Great out of the oven of course, but still chewy and perfect days after. They are great for homemade ice cream sandwiches, too! With 2/3 the recipe we made 25 cookies that are about the size of your palm.

Excellent!  My family gobbled them all up in no time.  Note:  I tried adding the vanilla pudding mix everyone preferred this recipe as is.  Also, next time I'll cut down on the sugar a little.  It didn't need quite as much as the recipe called for.

This has been out family favorite for 20 + years. The cookies are soft, sweet and store quite well, although they hardly need storage at our house as they disappear quickly!

I made these last night and they are perfect!  I did make a few changes as recommended by others... I used half the salt, doubled the vanilla, and used 2 1/2 cups of flour.  Actually I probably used even more flour because I didn't level off the measuring cups.  I also used 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.  9 minutes was just right.  They are perfectly soft, delicious, and not at all flat.

I've been making these for years, I love this recipe, always turns out so good, it is important to let the dough refridgerate a few hours, over night is best, I've even frozen the dough and thawed over night in th fridge and also frozen baked cookies and thawed on the counter top for a few hours and they still turn out great!

This recipe is, of course, perfect :-) To create thicker cookies, I use half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour. I also use 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda instead of just 1 tsp baking soda. Did not incorporate nuts. 9 minutes at 350 F for golf-ball sized balls of dough worked quite well - cookies were just slightly underdone. I left them on the pan for an additional two minutes, then transferred to cool on a plate. Perfect!

Instead of using walnuts, I tried hazelnuts.  I only used about 1/2 cup and I crushed them.  They added a lovely flavor!

I used the comments that others made and used half butter and half shortening, and refridgerated for 10 minutes before baking and these cookies turned out really well!! Not flat at all!

ah, the fond memories of being little and mommy is making cookie brownies. I changed something however to suit my now adult tastes. Instead of walnuts or whatever, I used a handful of chopped hazelnuts, oh yum!

Great recipe! I used all margarine in my cookies and they were perfect... not too crispy or flat. I didn't have any nuts but I added in some Smarties (my kid's favourite!) Simple and tasty!

Very good taste but as is they do turn out a little flat. I agree they need a little extra flour, but an extra 1/2 cup does not make they chewy as many stated it makes them cake like - not my preference.

I followed the recipe exactly, and my cookies came out very flat and frankly not edible. And I'm pretty forgiving of food items containing chocolate!

Good base recipe.  I use the base and change up the chips depending on what I have on hand (ie. butterscotch chips, peanut butter chips etc).

This is the recipe my mother always made for us as kids. Now I make it for mine. I NEVER use the salt, and I always add about a cup more of flour and they come out amazing!! I like a doughy chewy cookie, and this is it!

This were very yummy, and my boyfriend loved them, but i have had better. They are a tad too fluffy for me. Maybe i over beat the butter? The only thing i did differently was 1 cup sugar instead of 1 and a half. And then i did half the salt. I cant imagine not making thoes changes, i was so sweet. but maybe thats why they were more fluffy.

this is the classic chocolate chip cookie.  i use twice as much vanilla and it really is an absolute must to have your butter at room temperature!  I accidently partially melted my butter in the microwave cause i was in a hurry and ended up w/very flat, very crisp cookies.  Definitely not what you want in a chocolate chip cookie.

these cookies where amazing, I was a little nervous when i saw how thin they where becoming as they cooked, but they have to be the best I've ever tried. They where crispy on the outside and the perfect chewiness on the inside. My oven is a little warmer tan most so i baked them for 8 or 9 mins and they turned out great.

I've read many times where people say this is their favourite recipe (on the Recipe Exchange) and I can see why. These cookies are awesome! I left out the nuts because I am not a fan of nuts in my chocolate chip cookies. I bit into one while it was still warm, mmm - what else can I say. Delish! Thanks for the recipe.

This was like the perfect cookie! Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside! I omitted the nuts, and used 1 C coconut instead. I must have made large cookies, though, because my batch only made about 30!

I added an extra tsp of vanilla, lessened granulated sugar to 1/2 cup, used a full cup of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of baking soda and powder and also used semi sweet chips for the extra chocolate chunks :-)  they were DE-LISH!!! The kids tore them up...and even made me leave batter for them to eat

One word: Yummy! These cookies are absolutely delicious. I followed everyone's suggestions (cut the salt to 1/2, vanilla pudding, using 1/2 cup of crisco, more brown sugar) and these cookies turned out so soft and chewy. I put half cup of white chocolate chips since I had them laying around, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, and about two tablespoons of peanut butter just to give it a hint of peanut butter. Will make them again for sure.

Thank you for a wonderful cookie recipe. I substituted reeses pieces for the chocolate chips because my husband is allergic to chocolate. He loved them and asked for more. To prevent them from spreading to much I let them firm up in the refrigerater and then put them directly into the oven. I made them again after reading something on line. They turned out even better than before. All my chocolate chip cookies were spreading to much. Now I don't cream the butter so much and also refrigerate the dough. My cookies finally came out just like they should and not flat.

I try a new chocolate chip recipie practically every week but when it comes to REALLY good cookie dough AND a great cookie...I keep coming back to this. The only change I make is use a half cup butter and a half cup butter shortening.

I don't know why people have said that their cookies came out flat.  I have relied on this recipe forever, as it was my grandmother's fave as well.  I do make sure that my eggs and butter are at room temperature before starting...don't know if that could make a difference.

Great cookie! Crisp on outside with soft chewy center. I add a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon. The prep time is longer than they last in my house.

These are wonderfully rich cookies. This has been the recipe my mom makes and taught me to make years ago. It's still great. These turn out bendy and soft and chewy. These are our in our top ten for choc chip cookies for sure. I like to make them with real butter (at Christmas or special occasions) they have a little different texture and a slightly different flavor, very rich, very melt in your mouth, yumm.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have tried.  The brown sugar is key.  It is also important to let the butter soften.  They turn out fairly flat and crunchy but that is how they are supposed to be.  However, I once tried turning it into a cookie cake for my kids and was disappointed.  If you try this or the squares as Nestle recommends, you have to spread the dough out flat or it comes out cakey, doesn't really turn golden brown and lacks the flavor of the cookies.

Five stars all the way. This is the perfect cookie recipe - no way to mess this one up. We used Mexican vanilla - just made it even better! We'll make these again and again.

Just wanted to say that I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose flour, because I wanted to make them a little healthier. They turned out GREAT!

i grew up making these cookies then gradually got into more healthful baking. the other day my boyfriend pleaded with me to make him a batch of "real toll house cookies". of course they turned out delicious. we omitted the nuts (his choice, not mine). this is a classic cookie but i'll continue to steer our diets away from excessive fats & overly refined flour. thanks nestle!

OMG, it's the recipe I've been waiting for...Thank you for sharing it.  I've tried quiet a few recipes, but this is the best.

Personally, it's best warm out of the oven, and with a tall cold glass of milk...yummy

When I got these cookies out of the oven, I got really excited) Although there is no such product as Nestle Toll House Chocolate Morsels in Russia, cookies were great) I used just chopped chocolate instead of it! Cookies were really easy to bake)

Well they were chewy for about 2 days, but only in the centre. After that, the milk didnt even soften them! And I did refridgerate the dough for an hour before baking..helped a bit for non-flattening cookies, but nothing special. Moms homemade are better!

Mmmm, these cookies are good. Not too sweet not to salty. They're just right. I think I over cooked them a little bit so they might end up kind of hard but a little milk will take care of that.

My mother made these cookies for me when I was a kid, so, of course, I now make them for my little boys.  They taste amazing and have a great texture, especially if I cut a minute or so off the recommending baking time.  This recipe will always be a family favorite!

I love these they are the best.My one friend always says "when are you making me my cookies again".Your family will love them mine sure does.Here is a tip I just tried it.Add half a cup of cocoa to make double chocolate chip cookies,but make sure you use only 2 cups of flour then.Also chill the dough like others suggest it really turns out great this way.

This recipe is easy enough for a kid to use. I can remember making these when I was ten years old. Excellent cookies! I never add the nuts.

The classic and still one of the best.  I usually leave out the nuts and I find that subbing one cup of whole wheat flour for one cup of the AP flour adds to the flavor and texture.  This Christmas, I used that recipe to make cookies for the extended family and despite the fact that two other moms also made chocolate chip cookies, mine were the ones gobbled up first.  In fact, some of the others are still there - hard as rock!

I'm rating this 3 stars because I changed it. My version, in my opinion, is a 5 star. :) This recipe always tastes best to me, but if you prefer butter like I do, they're always way too flat. So. I experimented, and I figured it out. Finally. I used 3/4 C salted butter, scant 3/4 C each of sugars. Added 3-4 T flour. (Did not cut down salt) Baked 10-11 minutes. Perfect consistency. Not flat, not cakey (which in my opinion is even worse). I refrigerated the first time, but the second time I didn't. They still turned out perfectly.

To the girl who put ground beef and chili powder and gelatin in this cookie.... please do us a favour and don't post that awful review again.  Sounds like you made chili in a cookie.  If you can't stick to the recipe, then don't review one.  These cookies are awesome exactly as is!!

The cookies tasted ok but looked awful and were paper thin. I definitely think this recipe needs to be revisited with some of the suggestions from other reviews. The tip about chilling the batter before baking might make a difference.

Great chocolate chip cookies, the only change I made was I used one cup of butter flavored shorting instead of butter. Everyone in my family loves these cookies so I am making them all the time.

These are the cookies I grew up on. My mother made cookies once a week.  She was known for her cookies.  The secret to the best cookies ever is to double the Receipe  except after doubling the flour round up to 5 cups of flour and only add the chocolate chips of one receipe.  They come out fluff and a little more cakey.  They are by far the best cookies ever.

This recipe gets so maligned and parodied ...
But it is a great recipe.
To get really soft, yet done/well-baked chewy delicious cookies, use this trick I learned years ago:
Add in at least 1/2 cup more flour st the end of mixing (more if you can - up to a cup.   Warning:  dough will get stiff.)
I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but the extra flour makes for very soft, lofty wonderful cookies.

I thinkTHERE IS TOO MUCH BUTTER. Also, if your cookies are flat it is because of that. If you use 1 cup butter, use more flour. Other than that, this recipe is good!

Yes, these do tend to flatten.  Having been through this recipe from memory about 25 times, and altering it 50+ times, here's how I figured out how to avoid the meltdown:
Use an electric mixer and over-mix the butter/sugar/vanilla .
Use big, fresh eggs.  I get the jumbo, mostly for the bigger yolks.
Mix up your eggs before adding them.
Use fresh baking soda (I don't know why, but it helps).
Use a silpat or an air-insulated baking sheet, or heat the oven with the broiler and turn it to bake a couple of minutes into the baking time; they melt from the bottom up.
Scrimp a tablespoon or so off the butter.
Pack in the flour.

They are too sweet.  I've found substituting a nice smoky scotch for the vanilla brings out a saltiness the vanilla buries.

I apologize if this appears twice! tried to upload pic; I have used the recipe on the nestle pkg for years and for the last few, my cookies have begun to turn out flat and crunchy when they used to be soft and thick; I keep following the directions to no avail. I'm going to try adding flour, and if that doesn't work, the refrigerating/room temp. I don't understand what has changed EXCEPT, I remember 30 yrs ago I thought the recipe called for 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter?

Just add extra flour if you don't like your cookie flat.
I add extra flour until I get a thick dough.

First off I have to say this recipe is amazingly delicious and very very very easy to make! From the recipe above I got about 3 dozen cookies but some of mine turned out pretty big so that's an error on my part! I didn't have room temperature butter, so I threw it in the microwave for a couple of seconds flipping it to make it soft and that was great! The batter comes out really fluffy and nothing like what you'd buy at the store but don't be discouraged! Take a small spoon and drop it onto the baking sheet and they will spread out just fine, though they will look like they are running/gooey! But have no fear they'll cook just fine! I cooked mine a little longer than the 9 to 11 minutes the recipe called for because they didn't cook as fast as that, I found that 10 to 12 minutes gave me soft cookies, and about 12 to 14 minutes gave me the crunchy but still delicious and not burnt cookie I was looking for. I tried to thicken up the batter by putting it in the fridge but that didn't work too well, but you could always add a little but more flour if you don't want a really fluffy batter.

I made these cookies and they came out wonderful! A few tricks which others have suggested is to make sure your eggs are at room temp, butter is softened, not slightly soft but completely soft and do not over mix. I also used kosher salt because that's all I had on hand and it gave the cookies a nice little 'twang' like a salty/sweet treat. I would suggest using parchment paper if you can. Along with the other suggestions above, it keeps the cookies from spreading & keeps them chewy. I've made these before & this was the first time I used these tricks and they came out perfect!

This is a good recipe, just when you are putting them on the sheet make them kind of tall.... Also, I would use 2 instead of 2 1/4 cups of flour. Other than that, these are great!

The last two times I baked these cookies, mine fell flatter than a pancake, they still had a good taste and they were real crisp. I followed the direction to the T. what can be causing this? My grandkids love chocolate chip cookies and I love to back, help me solve my problem. Could it be after I cream the butter and sugars, and egg with the vanilla, is it still ok to mix with the mixer or should I do that step by hand, this is the only thing I can think of.

I grew up eating these cookies as a child and I love them.  Although I think I have developed more of a sweet tooth over the years.  I now use 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and 1 cup of chocolate chips (half the recipe).  I also like huge cookies and use the traditional cookie scoop when portioning the batter.  I flatten the dough slightly and bake for 13 minutes.

These cookies are "ok".......I used real butter which prevents the cookie from spreading while baking.  The dough seemed a bit dry ut the cookies were ok - nothing special.

I've always got compliments on my chocolate chip cookies, wanting to know what I do different.  The only thing I do different is use Crisco shortening instead of butter and I chill the dough before I bake them, putting it back in the fridge in between batches.  I always have thicker cookies, I dont like the flat spread out crispy cookies the butter makes them to be.

A very classic chocolate chip cookie recipe that works. I usually omit the nuts.

To really up the wow factor of this cookie, use kosher/coarse sea salt. Add an extra 1/2 tsp and you will taste a hint of salt in the cookie, which enhances the chocolate flavor.

It's a favorite of friends and family alike.

The cookies I grew up with!  I love them flat and crispy.  I like to make them with white chocolate chips, cran raisins, and pecans.  It's the perfect cookie for those rare occasions that I don't want chocolate.

this recipe has been in our family for 4 generations.....however, about 40 years ago, we (me and my kids)omitted the salt and used self rising flower instead of all purpose flower.....resulting in cookies that puff up while baking, but deflate when cool becoming chewy on the inside... we liked them better that way.

Also, to the person whose batter "liquified".....do NOT melt the butter!!!  doesn't work!!!.....bring to room temperature...

this is my ultimate cookie recipe i use it for any cookie with chips and nuts. best advice especially being in Colorado, you will need extra flour, both for altitude and also for certain nuts like macadamia. not to toot my own horn but i make a mean white chocolate macadamia nut cookie :) also for newer cookie makers for good fluffy cookies your dough consistancy should be like play doh, not sticky and not crumbly, note that the more you play with it the greasier it gets so quick mixing and molding is key.

This is my tried and true recipe for chocolate chip cookies. The recipe os printed on the back of the bags of chips usually. Great recipe! You can change the chips--white chocolate, peanut butter, whatever suits you.

I don't make cookies often, but I had a taste for some good chocolate chip cookies. These were delicious, but for me, a little too sweet. Next time, I will add less sugar. Overall, it's great.

I (almost) always follow the recipe to a T and they always come out perfect! I noticed there were some saying they come out flat and hard during baking. When I bake while I visit my parents in Florida and it's particularly muggy out, I have to add an extra tablspoon of flour. Don't know if maybe that is an issue for some, but I have noticed it makes a world of difference when I add that little extra.  I have actually gotten this recipe memorized. My favorite all time cookies!

This is THE Classic...great recipe, BUT IF you do not want these cookies to go flat and too "crispy"...make sure that when you 
"cream" the butter and sugar that the butter is soft enough to "cream" but not too soft or warm(ish)...Refrigerate the dough for about 20 minutes and ALWAYS place dough on a cool, (at least room temperature)...baking sheet. If you ONLY have one sheet,(I do and it is an "Air Bake")...rinse it in cold water, (and dry), after each batch. Place freshly baked cookies on "cake racks" to cool.

The average chocolate chip cookie, but with nuts.  They're good, yeah, but nothing too special in my opinion.

Classic and easy recipe! I decreased the amount of granulated sugar and brown sugar to 1/2 cup each and added the small vanilla pudding mix before mixing in the morsels & nuts. Instead of all semi-sweet chocolate, I did 1 cup semi-sweet and 1 cup white chocolate morsels. Also, instead of all nuts I did 1/2 cup chopped glazed pecans and 1/2 cup chopped cranberries. IT WAS AMAZING!!!

These were super easy and absolutely delicious! However I've never made cookies before so I wish someone would have told me that they spread out when they're baked, because I ended up making only 30 since the cookies looked too small raw, but hey, you live and you learn! I seriously can't believe how delicious these are!

Not enough sugar and not moist. I had to add some almond extract for flavor. Also, not the typical cookie color. They seemed like plain white flour cookies. Not tasty

I LOVE THESE!!! I made them for my class this time, but when I made them for the teachers I went into the teacher's room after school and they were all gone. I suggest that you make these and hide them or else they will be gone in a flash! ( sorry if my spelling is off) :)

I always use this recipe but I use white wheat flour, reduce the white sugar to 1/4 cup and add a pkg. of butterscotch pudding mix instead. It's very good.

Classic! My favorite chocolate chip cookie... However over the years I have learned to not use real butter. Using real butter makes this cookie come out flat. For a thicker cookie use butter flavor crisco.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe there is.  I always use butter flavor crisco instead of butter.  This keeps them soft.  I also use 6 oz. chocolate chips and 6 oz. butterscotch chips and omit the nuts.  The butterscotch chips make them so creamy and delicious!  You have to try this!

These were amazing! I had just recovered from making some cookies that turned out very flat last week, and I was so amazed when I opened the oven door to see these beautiful puffy cookies! I literally started jumping and cheering right in the middle of my kitchen!  I did add a pinch of baking powder as well and chilled the dough before baking, as well as doubling up the cookie sheets after the bottoms of the first batch were a bit browner than I wanted. These cookies made me so happy, and they will definately do the same for you! =]

This was one of the greatest choc chip cookie recipes yet! Although I would add a tad bit more baking soda. Cookies were chewy and delicious but  a little flat. I used unsalted butter so maybe that had something to do with it. But overall  - they were loved!

My son (age 9) recently started making these with me hanging around just to watch and answer any questions he may have about the recipe.  He loves to add chocolate chips AND M&M's to the mix.  We typically bake them for about 9 min before pulling them out of the oven to "finish" baking on the cookie sheets.  This is his favorite cookie by far!!

OMG awesome. I ate way too much of the raw dough.     The recipe was easy and made a great cookie! The only change I made was that I doubled the vanilla, which I always tend to do. I agree with other posters who say to use room temp eggs and butter. Next time I might refrigerate the dough a bit before the baking process.

I never use to like this recipe but I tried it again and now I love it.  I add french vanilla pudding (as one review suggested) right before the chips.  They do turn out flat but that's not an issue for my family. They love them!!!

I halved the recipe but only got 18 because I made them quite big. Everyone loved them and they are probably one of the best chocolat chip cookies I've had in a long time.

I love this recipe. Instead of semi-sweet, I always use milk chocolate and white chocolate chips.

This is the recipe my mom used growing up.  They have a great taste.  I think they are best as a bar cookie, soft and chewy.  Mine tend to be crisp and flat when I make individual cookies.

After having made these I am never making any other chocolate chip cookie recipe again. I did as some of the other comments suggested and reduced the white sugar by 1/4 and added instant vanilla pudding mix. I also refrigerated the dough for fifteen minutes and baked for 8 minutes (my oven is weird and the bottoms were a bit too dark for my taste when I baked for 9 minutes). These cookies turned out perfect, gooey, and there were only three cookies left this morning when I woke up, out of the dozen I had yesterday.

I didn't grow up eating the "Toll House" chocolate chip cookies but these remind me of the moist and chewy cookies my family baked. I did alter the recipe, changing the final flavours a bit. I subbed almond extract and chopped cherry cordial "kisses" for the vanilla extract and chocolate chips. The extract was increased to two generous teaspoons. Omitted the nuts and used slightly less of both sugars. I did chill the dough for at least thirty minutes, possibly upto an hour. Had no issues with the cookies flattening. I made large cookies, resulting in about 20 cookies. I would definitely make these again, as the variations are endless!

A classic. Sometimes I leave out the nuts & put in shredded coconut instead. Either way you can't go wrong.

When my mom and I make these, she adds more flour (there's not a specific amount, we just add until it gets hard to stir and we have to put the bread stirrers on our mixer, haha) because they make the cookies so much softer. I gotta say, even though it's on the back of the chocolate chip bag, they are the best chocolate cookies I've ever had! I make them with my boyfriend all the time as a bonding experience.

I Would give it more stars if I could!!!  Great, Great, Great recipe. I used my butter and eggs at room temperature. It really did make a difference. Cookies were crispy on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside! I will be defiantly be making more! My husband, kids and neighbors went crazy over the cookies!  Thanks for adding the recipe!

I love the dough, but I can' seem to get these right.  They always turn out puffy and not chewy.  I've added more brown sugar and less white sugar and even changed ovens and nothing works.  Any suggestions?

Awesome cookies!!! The only thing I changed in the recipe was to place the dough in the fridge for 15mins before scooping out on the cookie sheet. I cooked for exactly 10mins.  My cookies came out chewy and not flat at all!! They are still chewy the next day!!

Good tasting, but they are seriously flat and crispier than I would have liked to see.  But they have a nice taste, and I'll probably try them again.

These were really good.  I used regular chocolate chips not semi sweet and it worked really good.  Mine went flat so the second half of my batter I put in freezer between batches.  It helped a little. Next time I will use other suggestions and put the pudding in and make sure all my ingredents are room temp.  I did not put nuts in mine as my hubby wanted just plain CC cookies.  Thanks for the great recipe!

after mixing everything together it was late and i was tired so i decided to bake them in a 15X10 pan for 25 mins, these cookies turned out like brownies with a chewy center, i only thing i did different was i added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract and an extra cup of chocolate morsels, my family said they were perfect, so i told them i was a secret recipe lol

I have been using this recipe since I first started to bake when I was little.  My dad taught me how to bake and his secret (which has never failed) is to add extra flour to this recipe.  Otherwise, the cookies will turn out flat.  Everyone always ask me how I get my cookies so formed and soft and delicious!  It is in the flour.  It is tricky because you don't want to add too much extra.  When the consistency turns from a thin dough to the consistency of refrigerated dough it is good!  Also, I will take them out of the oven even if they don't look fully cooked, because they will cook enough on the pan on the stove.

Good Recipe Refrigerate for 30 mins before using though... dont grease pan... dont double recipe there were soo many cookies they didnt even fit in the cookie jar which is pretty big. The break apart easily so wait for them to cool before taking off cookie sheet. I used 2 tsp vanilla and 1.5 tsp cinmin.... good luck happy baking

WE HAVE A WINNER!!!  I am infamous for being really bad at baking cookies. I am usually a good cook but my cookies always come out thin and feel like bricks. Finally, finally, FINALLY I have come across a recipe that is so perfect that even I can make *delicious* and perfectly-formed cookies out of it. I made a batch yesterday and they're all completely gone, so I'm doing another one today. Excellent!!!

For 2.5" to 3" cookies, this recipe yields approximately 36.  Generally, to help ensure chocolate chip cookies stay soft and don't go flat, it helps to use half butter & half shortening, chill the dough for at least 30 minutes before baking, and wait until your cookie sheets have cooled before reloading them with the next batch of dough.

I had never made chocolate chip cookies before as I am new to this country. No doubt these cookies I tried tasted very good, but they were way too greasy. The cookies also turned out very flat. My assumption is I should have added more flour than this recipe called for, and maybe will do so next time I make them. Wondering why nobody faced this problem like I did, maybe I had high hopes. Well, in spite of all that we loved the cookies & they are disappearing at a faster rate from the cookie box. Thanks for the recipe.

This has been a lifetime favorite but when I moved from Cali to Oklahoma, they kept turning out flat!!  I took the advice and tried adding an additional 1/2 cup of flour and it worked!!  I'm so thrilled because this really is the best recipe ever.

heres what I do to keep these cookies yummy, soft and not flat! Use more vanilla that specified, like 2tsp. Second, add and mix all the wet ingredients together all at once. Third, dont let the butter get too melted, just softened a lil bit. And finally(this is the most important to keep them from getting flat!) keep a half a cup extra of flour on hand to mix into the dough when everything is mixed so the dough is not too liquidy.

Honestly it doesn't get any better than the original toll house cookie recipe. Same recipe they use on the back of the bag. Reminds me of childhood :) Cookie always come out soft and chewy. Parchment paper is a lifesaver when it comes to baking these so you don't lose the chips on the bottom of your pan.

Classic recipe, and very hard to mess up. However, I would advise against the addition of instant vanilla pudding mix (in my case, about 2.5oz) as suggested by other reviewers below. The cookies came out far too sweet for the adults in my house, none of whom could be considered picky eaters when it comes to dessert. Instead, next time I'll try adding more baking soda or freezing the dough to make them fluffier.

Great recipe. I have made these so many times I could do it in my sleep.  I made a few changes over the years and started using Crisco stick instead of marg. or butter.  I also ad two teaspoons of salt and sometimes use dark chocolate chips.  Always delicious!!

Who doesn't love classic cookies?  For a new twist on a familiar favorite, substitute white chocolate chips and add chopped macadamia nuts.  Mmmmm...

I LOVE this recipe.  I've used it many times for different family events and also to bring to work.  They're always a hit. I usually will add walnuts to the mix, or, I'll bake two dozen (half the mix) then add half a cup of nuts to the rest so only half the cookies have nuts.  I also will add mini marshmallow's on top - to do this I take them out a minute before they're ready, pop on three or four and put them back in for a minute.  They're really great!

Amazing Cookies!
I found this recipe on the back of a bag of chocolate chips and just decided to make them one day for fun.  Little did I know, that these cookies would be such a hit!  They were amazing- the dough was light, soft, and fluffy and was melt in your mouth.  They all went and I was so happy to find a good cookie recipe.  I later on made them again and have ever since made many variations of them- mint, butterscotch, cinnimon, and peanut butter swirl.  They are so easy and I was even able to make twelve dozen in less then an hour and a half!  Thank you Nestle!

I've always wanted to try the original toll house chocolate chip cookie, but here in Saskatchewan, its really super hard to find any toll house products.  So when I ran into this recipe, I snatched it right away.  This is a great cookie recipe.  Of course I did add some nuts to the recipe.  I am going to fool around with the recipe just for the hell of it though, and maybe decrease some flour and add oatmeal,  stuff like that.  But like I said this is a great basic chocolate chip cookie that is definetly worth giving a rave review

Yummy, what wonderful comfort food. I never use nuts and sometimes use 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening. These make me feel like a kid again.

This is really, really great. I used half butter, half margarine so the cookies wouldn't fall flat. It would be hard to find a better chocolate chip cookie. I have a convection oven, and baked them for about 7 minutes at 350 degrees. They stayed moist and chewy, even after being refrigerated.

I baked this recipe for the first time over the weekend in order to give them by the dozen as gifts. Outstanding! I used less chocolate chips than called for and included chopped pecans. I also increased the vanilla flavoring to 1 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp butter flavoring. I chilled the dough for a couple hours then got to baking. I baked them for 10 minutes and 45 seconds. Ended up with 4.5 dozen perfect cookies that wowed their recipients. It has just become a staple at my house! :)

This recipe was great.  I cheated on Toll House and used Hersey's Milk Chocolate chips.  They were chewy and delicious!  I made them a little bigger than normal and took them out as soon as the edges were golden brown.  I also made the dough the night before, wrapped in saran wrap and took them out about 3 hours before I made them.  PERFECTO!  Can't go wrong with this recipe!

This cookie recipe is exactly what I was looking for! They are soooo good! I read the reviews before making them and per one reviewers suggestion I added a small box of pudding (I only had cheesecake flavor but you can't even taste it), also i chilled the dough in the freezer for a 1/2 hour before spooning onto the cookie sheet. The result was chewy moist wonderful cookies. I made my cookies big I guess because I only got 2 1/2 dozen not the 5 dozen the recipe calls for.

I'm not a fan of bland chocolate chippers. I gave these cookies a boost from the addition of ground instant oats. Grind them in the Cuisinart with fitted with the metal blade. I substitute 1/4 - 1/2 cup of the flour with the ground oats. It gives the cookie some body and helps to hold the vanilla flavour. But who can argue with the legendary Toll House? Granny used to add 1/4 cup of crushed potato chips to this recipe, so just blame genetics :)

This is a great recipe & worth making more than once.  If you're looking to try something new, though, this is not the recipe for you.  It is essentially the same as the Nestle Tollhouse recipe (more vanilla, no nuts & a shorter cooking time at a lower temperature).  Still, worth repeating.

Awesome cookies! Make it with 3 tsp of vanilla, real not imitation, instead of 1, and add a tbsp or two of milk. Also a tsp of baking powder. Make sure dough is cold when you drop it, i put it in the fridge for 20 minutes before I put them on the cookie sheet, and I make sure that for the following batches I wash the used cookie sheet in COLD water to make sure the dough is dropped onto cold sheets. If its warm the dough will melt, then the edges burn. Also the cookies dont turn out as flat if you use cold dough. I also melted the butter, and melted the brown sugar in that butter, works great!

I have tried MANY different chocolate chip cookie recipes over the years,and NOTHING compares to the  Original Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe!! These cookies ALWAYS turn out and they are so easy to make.I love to eat these cookies when they are warm right out of the oven, and I also like to have a nice tall glass of cold milk,to go with these DELICIOUS cookies!!Try these WWONDERFUL cookies and you won't be disappointed!!*SMILE*

A no fail recipe, I halved the servings and they still turned out very good. They came out a little thin, but they were crisp on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside, anyway. It's a very basic recipe, not too sweet and not too heavy.

Of course they're great - but also equally as good without the nuts.  Try substituting a portion of the chocolate chips with butterscotch chips.  Yummy!

Excellent!!  However, I must admit, I didn't use the Nestle chocolate chips.  I guess mine can't be considered the "original" recipe, but I used Chipits milk chocolate chips and they're still delicious!!  I might leave out the nuts next time for a change.  This recipe is a definite keeper!
