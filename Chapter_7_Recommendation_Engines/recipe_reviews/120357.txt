This is a simple and easy recipe. The finished product looks very "pretty".
I have made several of these and have frozen them (before baking) with great success. 
Just take from the freezer and bake at 375 for one hour.  This is a nice "make ahead" brunch for the busy Holidays!

This will be something I make for every brunch I have from now on. I cook every thing and let cool, then I roll it up in the dough and put it in the fridge over night and bake it in the morning. very good recipe!

Very yummy and easy to prepare.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and next time will probably double the amount of red bell pepper called for.  The two rows of crescent rolls was too wide for my baking sheet, it would be easier to assemble everything on top of a silpat on a clean counter and then place the silpat on the baking sheet.  Using a silpat, the bottom was nicely brown without becoming burnt.  I used kitchen scissors to cut the 1 in. wide strips in the crescent rolls. Total cooking time was about 18 minutes and then left it in the oven on warm for about 20 minutes with no problem (waiting for company to arrive).

Just finished making and eating this scrambled egg bread and enjoyed it!  I made changes to suit my own taste. Used ham that I julienned, left out the onions and peppers. (don't care for breakfast  taste)  Very easy to prepare and everything went as directed. Strips were a bit messy looking but when it baked it all blended together anyway and looked fine. Making for a friend with breast cancer for her next chemo treatment as she requested something without spices. A few suggestions ~  *do not take crescent rolls out of fridge till eggs are ready as dough gets too soft to work with.  *maybe try parchment to lay out dough as it does not fit on cookie sheet easily to assemble. Place paper with assembly on cookie sheet to bake. *Strips cut easy with scissors. I hear you can buy crescent dough without perforations now! *maybe just skip the strips and fold dough over and seal. *be sure top and bottom egg meat mixture go close to end so end slices are filled too. *if using meat or veggies, assemble it in layers with the egg and cheese because the ham leaked a little moisture on the bottom crust. *PLEASE "DO" use the egg white as it give it much more presentation. *make the eggs ahead of time and chill, then assemble when ready to bake or assemble and freeze. Whomever suggested to freeze with the cooking time already figured out, please let me know. Will make again using hot Italian sausage and fresh spinach for a lunch/dinner. Thanks for a show off recipe!!

The first time i made this, i followed the recipe exactly and it was divine!  Easy to make, and great tasting.

The second time, i went southwestern:  I substituted chorizo for ham and added some diced tomatoes and diced green chiles to the egg mixture before scrambling.  Salsa on top before serving makes it a perfect southwestern breakfast treat!

We really enjoyed this recipe and the presentation is beautiful. My daughter and I made this for her dad for father's day. He loved it!  I found the meat layer to be a little to thin. Next time I make this, I will add more meat... maybe even try thick cut bacon. Pretty tasty recipe as is, however. Also, I will use kitchen shears to cut the 1 inch slices in crescent roll dough. It was difficult to cut with a knife, especially since it overlapped the side of the cookie sheet I used.

This was great. I made it for Easter morning breakfast and everyone loved it! I didn't see at first that it was only 6 servings and I had more people, so I used the cans of dough separately and made 2 skinnier ones. Still worked! Yum!!

I made this for a friends birthday brunch.  I didn't have green onions so I subsituted with yellow ones. I was a little confused with how the strips were to be placed over the top, and found there was alot of extra dough at the ends. It had beautiful golden color, and presented wonderfully! the bread got rave reviews! Next time I will stretch out the filling so there is not so much end crust. I will definately make this again! Thanks!

Beautiful presentation and very delicious! I took it to a baby shower brunch and it was a real hit. People were asking for the recipe. I modified a little - reduced the milk a little and added a bit of heavy cream. Also, layered with ham & bacon for added flavor. Really a simple, but great tasting breakfast dish!!!

This made a pretty good meal. I cut the recipe in half, used bacon instead of ham (it's what I had in the fridge), and used Pam instead of butter. My total baking time was around 17 minutes.  Thanks for helping make a filling and tasty meal for dinner!

I love this recipe!  I usually make it with bacon and sausage instead of the ham.  Usually I cook the meats and egg mixture the night before so all I have to do is assemble the ingredients in the morning.  Another tip is to use the shredded cheese in between each layer so that it sticks together and does not seperate when you are trying to slice and serve.

Simple and delicious! I made it for church breakfast where it got lots of compliments and I was asked for the recipe. It's great to serve at gatherings because it presents well and is easy to eat. Will be making this one again.

I used turkey bacon instead of ham and the layer was just too thin. I'll definitely double up on the bacon next time. The bread turned out nice and golden brown, but a little too crunchy for my tastes. Next time I will cut down on the baking time by 5 min to see if that helps.

Overall this was a great recipe and easy to make. I also used kitchen shears and put a little cooking spray on my parchment paper to make the cutting and folding process easier.

Really great recipe! Easy to do, too. I used mushrooms instead of peppers (personal preference); will try broccoli next time. Preparing the recipe on parchment paper made it easier to slide onto the baking sheet and then onto a serving platter. I will also saute the green onions a bit before adding them to the mixture. I used small ham cubes instead of julienne strips, increased the amount some because I had extra.
Rave reviews from my guests! A "keeper!"

There is something about this recipe that makes everything so good!  Maybe it's the cream cheese.  But it's wonderful.  I use whatever I have on hand, usually bacon, and whatever veggies I have as well.  Very flexible.  I made it once for an 11am bridal shower and it was a hit.

Made this for a shower brunch and it was a huge hit!  Everybody thought it was store bought because it looks so beautiful.  I definitely recommend using kitchen shears to make the cuts.  I substituted bacon for the ham and it turned out great.  Next time I make it I might subtitute prosciutto for the ham and goat cheese for the chedder.

This was decent. I have no doubt that if I brought it to a potluck it would go in seconds and people would rave about it. BUUTT for me, it would have been better if something other than those tasty croissants was used as a bread. I've had a bakery version of this and it was AMAZING. So if I can figure out a way to used another type of bread maybe it would work for me. As it is, I much perfer croissants plain or with a bit of nutella, with the eggs and veggies I added (mushrooms and green onions) it didn't taste right to me. This is of course, a personal opinion, the recipe was easy to follow and make. Maybe with biscuits it would taste better...

This was wonderful and a big hit! I had forgotten to get the red pepper so added chopped fresh mushrooms and used green onions that I had on hand. I was unsure how it would look after baking as I had difficulty cutting the 1 inch strips and then folding them over. But with the egg white brushed on top it baked to a beautiful golden brown and looked great - though not like the picuture here. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was a hit, but I made a few changes to make it vegetarian and I only gave it 4 stars because the cooking time seemed to be off. I ended up making this into 2 braids since I only have a large toaster oven that couldn't fit 1 long one. I used skim milk and whipped cream cheese, I didn't add any salt but I did add a couple dashes of Mrs. Dash (the unsalted one). I used a little more than 1/4 cup of chopped red bell pepper (somewhere between 1/3 or 1/2 a cup), an entire small diced yellow onion and cooked these down until the onions were translucent and the peppers soft (cooked these before the egg mixture). All pan greasing and sauteing was done using olive oil instead of butter. Lastly, I replaced the ham with sliced bottom mushrooms (baby bella or shitaki would have also worked) and used Italian-blend shredded cheese instead of cheddar. The first one I made at 350*F cooked in under 15mins and actually burned the top a bit. The second one I was more careful, cooked at around 275* and it took between 20 and 25 minutes and came out perfectly risen, heated through, and golden. I think you have to tweek to your own oven but the temp and time written here were definitely off!

Made this for Christmas Brunch, the family really enjoyed it.  I made a couple of adjustments.  First, I used cooked & chopped breakfast sausage instead of ham.  Second, I sauteed the veggies lightly before stuffing in the bread, and I mixed all the ingredients together before putting them in the bread instead of layering.  I also about doubled the amount of red pepper.  Delicious!

I made this for a breakfast at church and it was well received.  I followed luv2run's advice and made it the day before and froze it.  It only took 35 minutes to bake since it was only frozen for 7-8 hours.  It looked and tasty great!  I will definately make it again with variations.  This would make a great dessert bread using apple pie (or other fruit) filling and after baking, add a glaze.  Thanks Julie for sharing this wonderfully easy, yet elegant bread!

It was great. I used mushroom, bacon and sausage instead of ham. One less egg next time. I think the egg was a little overpowering. Great recipe.

This recipe was so easy, but it looked really impressive.  I too used scissor to cut the dough and added a mix of spices to the eggs.  I used smoked turkey instead of ham and will try again with turkey bacon.  Try this if you want and easy but delicious appetizer for company!

Maybe it's just me, but this looked like a lump of goo when I got done.  I couldn't make it look pretty, the dough was hard to work with.  Aside from appearance, it was bland.

This recipe is phenomenal.  I made it for St. Patty's day brunch and now am making it for our 4th of July party.  Everyone loved it!  Easy to make and a crowd pleaser!

I made this for a brunch and it was a hit!  I used bacon for half of it (instead of ham) and made the second half vegetarian by leaving out the meat and adding extra cheese.  It was the first dish to run out.  Oh and even though the dough didn't look so great  before it was cooked, it came out beautifully in the end.  I baked it for 15 min at 425.

Great taste. For some reason putting it together was a pain, and it exploded after 10mins in the oven. I dont think its the recipe, i put it together wrong somehow.

This was fantastic! I used reduced fat crescent rolls and added mushrooms as well as some garlic salt. It was huge! My husband, who hates leftovers, was super excited to have this to eat all week.

awesome...I will make this again for a brunch I am hosting next week! I lightened it up a bit by using 4 eggs and 4 egg whites, low fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls. I was amazing and I did not miss anything I substituted!! Really really amazing. I also used turkey sausage instead of ham and it was so so so so good. For serious...this is one of my new favorite recipes!

I absolutely love this recipe. It's very easy, and my mom and sister absolutely loved it (and my sister is hard to please!). I did make some alterations just based on what my family likes...I did not use ham, and I used salsa instead of the pepper and minced onion instead of the green onions. Also, I didn't worry about cutting strips...I just put all the ingredients in the middle and wrapped the sides of the crescent rolls up over!  THIS WAS EXCELLENT.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is a very easy and visually attractive brunch option. I can't eat ham so I used some cooked bacon instead and I forgot to add the butter and it turned out delicious. I would imagine this recipe could easily include other filling combinations like spinach, tomato, and feta or sausage, onions and peppers. Thank you for a great recipe!!

Very good. Will definitely make again. You can use any kind of breakfast meat. It's simple and pretty, too.  I baked it for about 15 minutes. It was golden brown and cooked all the way through.

This was really good. I used crescent rolls for one and flaked biscuits for the other and ate for dinner. I will also try it with sausage and bacon.

Oh my, this was fantastic!! We devoured it! I was in a hurry for a quick dinner for my husband, me, and our toddler and this turned out great. I just halved the recipe and it was plenty for the 3 of us. Thank you for this very tasty recipe. I didn't change anything about the recipe except I didn't roll it up a fancy way, just flipped one side over the other.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I have made it about 8 times now, following the recipe exactly and I have always gotten rave reviews. It is a great brunch dish, or weekend/holiday breakfast. It's pretty easy to make and looks beautiful as well. Every member of my family begs me to make this on Sunday mornings...and with my picky eaters, that speaks volumes!

This recipe was excellent although I can't imagine making this recipe with 8 eggs! We used 4 eggs and it was perfect for the two crescent roll containers (minus one row or 4 crescents). We had leftovers for the next day so I wrapped it up in foil but put a paper towel under the bread to prevent it from getting soggy...it even tasted great the next day!

This was really good.  I left out the red peppers, used low-fat cream cheese, and didn't fuss with cutting and folding the dough in any special way.  I just folded each side over and tucked the ends under. It acutally looked really good after it baked.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I'll definitely make it again and will probably try adding some mushrooms or substituting sausage for the ham.

This was awesome! It looked so pretty, and it tasted great. Hubby didn't like them (he hates croissants), but ate them anyways. I had him take the rest to work, and his co-workers loved them. One even said it was better than BK...=)

She used Mexican Chorizo instead of Ham and added chilis and tomatoes. It was yummy.  My husband and I loved it! There was nothing left!

Very well received by my guests this weekend...I used breakfast sausage instead of ham, sauteed the green onion and ch red and yellow bell pepper briefly before adding egg mixture. Excellent!

Perfect recipe!  I left out the red pepper.  Don't let the crescent roll dough get warm.  Keep it cool and work quickly or it will be very sticky.

Huge hit at a company "breakfast club". Easy to make without any advance prep the night before (though I had the ham and egg mixtures ready to go to save time for an early morning.) Don't skip the egg white to finish it off as it really makes it pretty!

Good, but this thing is very large.  I halved it and bf and I had it for breakfast with fruit.  Not sure where the six servings came from--this is a lot of bread for six servings!  Going by that logic, we should have three servings with the half.  Not so much . . .this will be breakfast for us for the rest of the week.  Bf said it needed more filling, and I agree.  More meat, more eggs, so if I make it again I'd halve the bread but keep the amount of filling the same.  I was distracted while making this so forgot to add the peppers to the egg (no matter, just added it on top), then forgot to put the cheese on top of the egg before braiding the bread.  Since I didn't feel like taking the bread apart, I just put some cheese on top of the braid itself.  It worked well enough, but next time I'll remember to put the cheese inside.  I've made braids like this before, and even if it looks horrible before putting it in the oven, it bakes up beautifully.  I used the Golden Crescent Rolls dough from here as the crescent rolls (halved the dough to make a half loaf of this).  Thanks for the recipe!

I made two of these for Sunday School.  For the first, I followed the recipe, except added extra cream cheese, garlic salt & cajun seasoning.  I did not really care for the deli ham.  Next time I will use ham chunks.  For the second, I used brocolli and the other extra items added in.  It was loved by all.  I will certainly make this again!

Made this for the first time on Mother's Day and we all loved it! I only left out the onion (Husband is allergic) and substituted mushrooms. We were discussing how versatile this recipe is and how it would be easy to make other substitutions. I think next time I will try ham, swiss, and roasted asparagus or chicken, artichoke, roasted red pepper and provolone. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a big hit on Easter.  I made two, one with ham and one without.  I think next time I would make both with ham and skip the red pepper on one of them.  Or make one with ham and one with bacon.  So many things you can do with this.  Very yummy!

A keeper!! Made for a Brunch.  Beautiful presentation.  I made as directed but added a small can of diced green chilis/drained.  Loved by everyone and not too spicy.

This was great and shockingly easy.  I used turkey bacon instead of ham.

I am not a great cook but this made me look like one! I made this for a work brunch and it got rave reviews from all.  I did make a minor mistake in using the BIG and Fluffy cresent rolls and needed to adjust the amounts of ham and eggs to suit.  The only porblem was it ended up too large to fit my platter.  Next time I will be sure to get the right rolls and all should be fine.

I can't believe how quick and beautiful this dish came out! I made two for a surprise wedding shower for a co-worker and they were a hit! I made one with no meat (for the vegetarians) and one with deli turkey instead of ham. I also replaced the cheddar cheese with pepper jack cheese for an added kick. It was the first thing to go and everyone asked for the recipe afterwards! I will be making it again soon. Thank you this recipe.

This as very good.  I actually crumbled pre-cooked turkey sausage in the skillet instead of the layer of ham on the dough.  Used kitchen shears for the top...might just fold over next time.  Served with salsa on the side.  Will definitely make again!  Yum!

I made this recipe for a mothers day brunch that I attended. Everyone LOVED it, and wanted a copy of the recipe. I omitted the red pepper and had the deli cut the ham as thick as possible. I also "fried" the ham in a saucepan with cooking spray before assembling. I used reduced fat crescent rolls and egg beaters and no one knew the difference. To ease the preparation I assembled the bread on parchment and lightly sprayed my knife with cooking spray before cutting the strips.  This recipe was easy, looks really pretty, and is great for parties or brunches. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was great! It was a fun way to get my picky-eater 3 year old to eat eggs. My husband actually raved about this one, and told me to keep this recipe handy.  If I just rating "ease" of the recipe, I would have to rate a 4 though.  The crescent dough became very gooey and hard to work with when it came time to wrap it up. I think next time I won't bother with cutting the strips, but instead just fold the sides over the top of the filling.  This way I don't have to worry about filling oozing out of the sides of the seams.  I love the fact that it is a budget-friendly meal with lots of leftovers.  THANK YOU!!

This was so quick, easy, and good!  I lowered the fat by using reduced fat crescent rolls, egg substitute, turkey bacon, and fat free cream cheese - so tasty!  Thanks for the recipe.

This looked beautiful out of the oven.  It was fun to prepare.  I used turkey and salami because I was out of ham.  Tastes good.

Fabulous!  I doubled the recipe and made two loaves, used bacon instead of ham, and was a little more liberal with the amounts of bacon and cheese and what a hit.  My guests didn't stop raving about it.  A real winner!!

This was a huge hit at Easter Brunch.  It was devoured before other things got touched!  I did use bacon instead of ham and omitted the onions and peppers since the brunch was primarily kids.  Thank you for this recipe!  I never received so many compliments!

This was a hit, when taken to a church
brunch. My husband really liked the taste of it. I used bacon and it worked
fine. One note,as I was laying out the dough it was to wide for the cookie sheet! So I layed out 1 1/2 of the cans
of dough. So I had 1 row of dough left.I finishd the egg mixture and placed it on top of the bacon,added the cheese.Brought the long sides up as far as they will go. Then layed the extra dough right on top,pinched it closed where needed. Brush with egg white and let it bake. It looked good but next time I try to be creative with the top piece!

This is a great recipes.  You can adapt the filling however you like.  It did take a couple of tries to get the braiding down, but you will get the hang of it even if you are a novice cook like me.  Great flavor, since the eggs cook ahead of time, no extra water and less eggy taste.  Good seasoning.
