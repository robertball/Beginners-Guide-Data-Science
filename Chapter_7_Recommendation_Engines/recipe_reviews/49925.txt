My husband grew up eating this.  The only difference is instead of making the cream sauce his mother used to use cream of mushroom soup.  Less work and just as yummy.

Super.  This recipe was a childhood favorite.  I put the salmon in puff pastry cups for a fancier meal.

Creamed salmon has been a staple all of my life, but we saute the onion along with finely sliced celery, and we add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning. It just depends upon what's in your panty. We also think that it's better the next day.

I love creamed salmon on toast, I saute a little diced onion and add 1/2 tsp. of dried mustard to the  cream sauce. I replace the peas with cooked asparagus spears layed on the toast before I add the salmon mixture.

This recipe is exactly how my mother made it except we had it over mashed potatoes.  It's still a family favorite! I use skim milk (and cook it longer to thicken the sauce)and  serve it over a baked potato.  A great cold-weather meal!

I skipped the peas and the pea juice, and it turned out really well. I had to let it cook for 20 minutes before the flavors started blending together nicely. Makes a lot. very easy, I would definitely make this again!

As written, this is the recipe I ate (and hated) throughout childhood because I didn't like salmon, hated canned peas and the white sauce was always the consistency of library paste.  But then I decided to see if I couln't tweak it to something we'd like.  So I sauteed a sweet onion and fresh mushrooms in evo, blanched some fresh peas, used canned red salmon instead of pink and seasoned the sauce with thyme and white pepper.  I served it over whole wheat pasta and loved it!  Since I had no liquid from the peas, I thinned the sauce with a bit of the pasta water.  We will be having this agin for sure.

Great comfort food! My mother used to make this. I did use leftover grilled salmon instead of canned. I also added  some finely minced onions and parsley in the sauce for added flavor. I substituted frozen peas for canned too. My husband had never eaten this before and he loved it. I will start making it again!

Simple. Filling. Delicious. Made this for dinner last night..and it was so quick and easy! The only changes I made were that I added some onion and garlic powder. Comfort food for sure. This made 4 very large servings. Yum. Thanks for sharing this recipe..I will be making this one again!

I had left over salmon so thought it would work to cream it.  This is really good.   I had frozen peas so just added more milk until I liked the consistency.   I served it over brown rice and it really was tasty.

My husband LOVED this!  Surprised me, because even though we jar and process our own salmon from fresh, he usually curls his lip at the mere mention of canned salmon.  I also loved it.  Had intended to follow the recipe completely, but my peas were ones I'd frozen and vacuum-packed last fall so there was no liquid in them to add to the sauce.  Guess what?  Some of the liquid from my jar of salmon went into it instead, and it was great!  No problem with a lack of salmon-taste, for sure.  Served it over a combo of brown/wild rice, as we had some left over.  Will make this again for sure.  I'm thinking some carrots might be good in there with the peas, too.  Great recipe!  Thank you!

Quick and easy!  This was a yummy lunch.  I substituted heavy cream for the milk and it came out to thick so I thinned it with some milk.  I also did not add the peas in with the salmon since I have some that won't eat peas but instead served them on the side.

Nostalgic dish that's bland bland bland. I added a good squeeze of yellow mustard from the bottle to give it SOME kick and flavor. It helped. Also I substituted about a quarter cup of the milk for the salmon water out of the can to enhance the salmon flavor. I'd definitely advise adding mustard or dill or paprika.

My family and I absolutely love this recipe. It's quick and cheap. My kids at first refused to taste it. Once they did my son had 3 servings and my very picky daughter had two! It's a great comfort food on a cold wintry night. For those looking to lighten it up I'd try using skim milk and a tablespoon of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter. I also like to serve it with a side of peas.

This is a great recipe for a quick and filling meal. I used frozen peas, so added some of the liquid from the tin of salmon as a replacement. I also added some fresh parmesan and cheddar cheeses in to the sauce for added flavor. Topped with extra cheese and chopped fresh parsley.

I've made this using dried beef, but never salmon. My family loved it! Super comfort food- but I never realized that canned salmon had so many calories-630 in a single can! Nevertheless-definitely worth it!! I am always looking for different things to try especially during Lent - we will be having this again!

Loved this!  Quick, easy and tasty!  We were going out to eat but decided it was too cold and looked in the pantry to see what was available.  Everything in this recipe was in the pantry.  Added salt, pepper and garlic powder - perfect!

This was good and sooo easy. Just before serving, I put in a Tbsp of curry paste, gently stirring until it dissolved, then served it warm on toasted herb rolls. It was excellent!

My mom always made this with either tuna or salmon when I was growing up. I've made it for my own family for the last 40 years, always by changing it here and there depending on what I have in the pantry. Tonight I used leftover grilled salmon which worked out fine. Besides the onions I added parsley, garlic and RED BOAT FISH SAUCE. I also used 2 cups of milk instead of one because we like it not so thick...let it cook down to the right consistency. Served over toasted English Muffins with a side salad. Yum!

I have never made anything from canned salmon but salmon patties! This recipe sounded so good I had to give it a try with a few changes, I didn't have any peas. I saute finely chopped onion, celery and portabella mushrooms in the butter. Then whisk in 1/4 cup flour......added the juice from the can of salmom, 1 1/2 Tbsp. Honey mustard that I made from honey, mayonnaise and regular mustard. And 2 cups milk ( less or more as needed for consistency). Then stired in the flaked salmon along with salt and pepper to taste. Served over Texas toast along with saute small diced potatoes with onions and an egg over easy. This was so good, my husband can't stop raving about it! I will try the original ingredients when I have peas on hand the next time , as I realize I changed it a lot.

This is a great base recipe.  I used olive oil instead of butter, cornstarch instead of flour (gluten intolerance), green beans instead of peas (didn't have peas).  It was delicious.  Everybody LOVED it.  Thank you, Jacque, for sharing such a great recipe.

I too had this as a child, but my mom made it with canned mushroom soup.  She also chopped up a couple of hard boiled eggs and added them to the pot.  I think it was to make the food go further.

This was good, reminded me of my grandmother who made this a lot when I was growing up.  I left out the peas (served them separately), added a little garlic powder to the salmon mixture, then I let it sit in the fridge a little while to thicken up.  It still is very soft but I coated large spoonfuls in flour and then fried them.  I probably won't make it often, but it brought back good memories for me.

Wow, like so many others, I had this all the time when I was a kid!  (Especially during Lent on Fridays.)  It really is a super easy and delicious dinner.  I do serve the peas on the side.

Excellent!...Husband and son RAVED over this recipe. I served it over shrimp stuffed puff pastry.I used frozen peas (because canned peas are just disgusting)I cooked the peas according to package directions and served them over the top of the creamed salmon. It was wonderful..thank you for sharing.

The smile and happiness on my husband's face gives it a 5 star review! I made it in those early days of marriage in the 80s. but as the kids got older, they did not like  it so I stopped making  it . Now as most of the kids are not around , I made this  recipe  and  put over mashed potatoes ,  as our mom's did, and he was so very happy and loved it.

Recipe was easy and I'll make again (because I bought canned salmon in bulk at Sam's Club!)m but I think I'm not much of a creamed salmon person.

We had this meal growing up...sometimes with just peas as a side dish Adding a sliced boiled egg or two adds to the protien and flavour.

I had never heard of this before! I made it for myself when my husband was out of town. I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this. I love tuna noodle casserole, so I thought I might like it. I didn't have canned peas, so I used frozen ones, and I substituted vegetable broth for the pea liquid.  Great one pan meal! Thank you for posting it!

Made this recipe this evening.......It`s an old familiar dish that my mother made often. We also had hard boiled eggs and fresh fried potatoes with it. Oh it was and still is soooo good.I have always added the "juice" from the canned salmon and often dried dill weed, sometimes garlic and onion powder. Comfort food is correct,and I am 80.

Wow, I was so skeptical about this recipe but could not have enjoyed it more!! I did change it a bit, using a white sauce mix (Pioneer, I think) so it had a bit of seasoning and pepper in it and also cut back the fat a LOT. Then had a hefty cup of leftover frozen peas from the night before and used them instead of canned but boy howdy!! Was it ever good for something SO simple!! We served it over mashed potatoes for dinner and then had leftovers on toast for lunch the next day and both were equally satisfying!! Such a nice easy way to add fish to our diet!! Thanks for puttint it out there!!

Successfully made it in the microwave by twice interrupting the power to stir.  Substituted for canned a family preference for (cooked) frozen peas and ladled it atop boiled potatoes, Norwegian-American style, instead of toast.  With fresh-ground black pepper, sooo yummy.

This was pretty good. I used a smaller can of salmon (I didn't know it was going to be so expensive!) but next time I think I will use the larger can so it has more of a salmon-taste. The sauce thickened up quickly, and it all mixed together very well. A little on the bland side.

I softened 1 T. minced onion in the butter before adding the flour. Was out of milk, so had to use heavy cream. Only used 3 spoons full of peas, along with some of the liquid to help thin the heavy cream. Added marjoram, parsley, and dill, and still thought it needed something. 
Threw in a decent splash of hot sauce and it came out pretty tasty.

I give this one a big thumbs up. I used left over grilled salmon insted of cannes. Worked great. Made a single serving because nobody else in the family likes salmon. They don't know what there missing. Brought back my childhood.

It was finally good to use canned salmon for something other then salmon cakes.  This receipe was very  easy to make.  I used frozen peas instead and just added a little more milk.

I come from po-folks so salmon when I was a kid was too expensive.  Tuna is what my mom used.  I'd totally forgotten about this dish.  I haven't had it in forty five years or more.  It was great having it again.  My dad, loved it to.  Oh, I put it over thick slices of multi-grain toast.  That really made it good.

Delicious!  I made it a little fancier for a dinner party by (1) using 1 inch pieces of steamed skinny asparagus in place of the canned peas (using some of the steaming liquid in place of the pea water); (2) using a sliced bagette, toasted on both sides in the broiler, in place of the toasted bread; and (3) adding about 2 tablespoons of fresh thyme from my garden to the cream sauce.  Next time I'll use a little more.  It was a hit at the party.

This recipe reminds me of my mom's recipe.  I haven't had hers in years but now I make this quite often for a simple comfort meal!  I make 2 pots of it though.  One with salmon for me and the other with canned chicken for fiance and kids!  It's a bit bland tasting so I'm still trying to tweak the seasonings but that won't stop me from making it again and again!!

Served it at my book club dinner.  It was a hit. I read a few other reviews and combined some of their ideas. I used cream of mushroom and cream of asparagus soup and ½ can milk instead of sauce from scratch.  I cooked fresh salmon separately in fry pan and crumbled salmon over pastry cups and then topped with sauce. I also added minced garlic and old bay seasoning to sauce.

Quick and easy. Personally, I like it better without the peas. Peas make it more filling; however, for me, it takes something away from the salmon taste.

I made this without peas because we didn't have any.
I added a few dashes of Old Bay Seasoning and it was delicious!! Not bland at all and my husband loved it too!
Would also be excellent over egg noodles in a casserole!

was a favourite on a chilly night as a kid - did the canned mushroom soup thing.  Now I sauté onions, use frozen peas, and some fresh dill - really yummy.  Now I have it on my mind and have to make it tonight!

This my idea of comfort food. I've made it for years. I absolutely have to have Green Giant baby peas in the silver can! They are much more delicate and tasty...Trust me. Pea juice, no. Dill weed and nutmeg yes. I actually love it best on biscuits.

Great recipe.  The same my mother and my grandmother made, only we ate it over broken up saltines.
