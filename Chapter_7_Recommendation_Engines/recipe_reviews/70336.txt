"The pasta is incredible."  My husband's opinion. Combined this with the layering aspect of Greek Spaghetti I.  Mixed the sauce and seasoning ingredients listed with the spaghetti, then layered pasta, crumbled feta, pasta, sliced provolone, pasta, shredded mozzerela and sharp cheddar.  I will put a layer just under the last layer of cheese next time to keep it more moist, but it was great.

This was a fairly good recipe. A bit too much tomato sauce for my taste, and it tasted a bit too much like spaghetti.  The mozzarella and feta chesses add a unique taste.

I love this dish! I add zucchini, crushed red pepper, use a spicy tomato sauce and add a lot more of both cheeses. Mmmmm!!!

Good recipe with a home-cooked feel.  I'd reccommend more vegetables (whatever kind you like that you have around), and a little less tomato sauce.  I used cheddar instead of mozarella and it worked well.

This was just "okay". Very much like any tomato-based pasta, nothing to write home about. Didn't seem especially Greek to me. I even added artichoke hearts, still not impressed.

This recipe is great. You can add almost anything to it to change it up a bit. Even the pickiest eaters in my family loved it! Plus its incredibly easy.

This was a decent  pasta dish, but it wasn't much more than a baked spaghetti-type thing.  I did add mushrooms to it and I wish I would have mixed some mozzarella in with it, instead of just on top. Thanks!

I was looking for a recipe for a Mediterranean-type pasta casserole I had been served at a luncheon recently. This was the closest I could find.  I omitted the tomatoes and tomato sauce and added some ham (I cubed it) I had leftover from Easter. (I believe the one I had sampled previously contained sausage and ham.) I also substituted the green onion for red onion and added some Greek salad dressing for a bit of extra kick.  My family loves this and would add green olives if I would let them! ;)

Really good, made this for company and they were very impressed!  I added a little more sauce the next time as it cooked out a little and was a tiny bit dry the first time!

I forgot to add the onions but it was still very good. One might add broccoli.

Not a "wow" dish.  Very much like any other basic baked pasta dish, but with odd quantities of ingredients and a dry, fairly bland result.  Not really "Greek" tasting either.  I'd save yourself a pan and make the whole thing on the stovetop.  I won't make this again - not terrible, but not worth repeating.
