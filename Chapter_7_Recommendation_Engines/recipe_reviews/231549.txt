Made this recipe for dinner tonight - loved it! The panko and cheese topping is so light and yummy. Next time, I will omit the salt completely. Baked in my oven in 20 minutes to golden brownness and flaky delicious fish. Served with steamed fresh veggie medley. I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

The only deviation from the recipe was to brown it under the broiler at the end to give more eye appeal.  I couldn't really taste the flounder enough that I'd pay $12.99/lb again, so next time I will substitute more affordable tilapia.  We enjoyed this dish.

Good enough for a quick dinner. I skipped brushing filets with butter, sprinkled them with lemon pepper instead and added some dill weed to the breadcrumb mix instead of thyme. Mom said they could use a little more Parmesan, and I thought they had plenty as is. I did like the way panko crisped and browned giving the dish a nice crispy topping. Will probably make again.

My 17 year old daughter who has never cooked fish before made this for dinner tonight. I think it is one of the easiest and best recipes I have tasted. She followed the recipe exactly. It barely made it to the table because we were all tasting it before she could put it on the serving plate.
This one went right into my recipe box. Thanks so much for sharing.

I was worried that the fish would be dry, but it was as moist as could be.  Really, I changed quite a bit because of what I had on hand.  I had thawed some haddock, so that is the fish that I used.   Also, I did not have panko breadcrumbs, but instead had seasoned breadcrumbs which is what I used.  Because of this, I didn't also add thyme.  I added the salt to the fish prior to putting the crumb topping on.  I found that it was WAY too salty, but it could have been because I did this, although Parm cheese is salty and I questioned the quantity of salt before adding it.  That would be my only complaint.  Next time, I will make it this same way, only I won't bother with added salt, pepper or thyme.  I never use pepper, so I've got the recipe down to four ingredients.  Amazingly good and easy.  I rarely cook fish because I've not been happy with options for cooking it; now I'll have it much more often. Yay!

This is very tasty but it needs some seasoning added to the panko mixture and the topping could be too overpowering if used in the quantity called for.  I added a lemon-pepper seasoning mix to the crumbs and reduced the topping by almost half and it turned out just right.  I will definitely use this method again on flounder as well as other light fish such as tilapia.

Easy and quick.  Made this first time in December, and made it a couple of times again already.  My twelve year old and one of his ten year old friends gave it thumbs up and wanted seconds. Based on reviews, did leave out salt and added some lemon pepper to panko (plus some dried parsley for pretty color more than anything else.) Good meal with minimal fuss.

It was okay as is.  I thought garlic should have been included as one of the ingredients. The second time I made, I included 1 teaspoon of garlic powder.  I used a 1/2 teaspoon of dill instead of a pinch of thyme. Garlic really gives this recipe a better flavor.  Next time I make it , I will saut√© 2 -3 garlic cloves in the butter used in the breadcrumb mixture and melt the butter in that same pan for coating the fish to increase garlic flavor.

I used frozen fish for this and noticed that it was very slimy in its packaging. So besides the obvious part of draining the fish, I placed the fish on top of paper towels and placed a sheet of paper towels over the fish to suck up all that moisture. 

When baking, I placed some breadcrumb mixture under the fish as well - though next time I may have to increase breadcrumbs from 1 cup to a  1 cup 1/2  to really cover both sides.

I liked this! Recently bought a family pack of frozen flounder for my boyfriend and I, and I have struggled to find a recipe I like besides frying. I altered the recipe for one large filet which I cut in half so I didn't struggle with too much topping. Also seasoned the fish with lemon pepper salt before brushing w butter and added no additional salt. Subbed parsley for thyme. Yummy! Will try again with tilapia!

As I was preparing it I was saying "I really hope this is good because it is so easy to make."  Well it really is good.  Everyone at the table ate it and with my bunch that doesn't happen often.

Turns out flounder is not one of our favorites, but recipe turned out well!  Flounder, though, was almost tasteless.  Without the Panko and Parmesan, it would have been too bland!  :)

Flounder is a light tasting fish that doesn't need much or it overpowers it. To reduce the price, find an Asian market for fresh fish and never buy frozen because the fish tastes like paper/cardboard once defrosted. I know how salty Parmesan is so I had to modify the salt.

I substituted lemon pepper as suggested by earlier reviews and broiled the fish the last few minutes, but it was not crispy enough to counter the soft texture of flounder. I would also cut back on the butter as it made the coating a little rich for our taste. I will not make again, although the taste of the coating was good

This was delicious!  After reading some of the reviews I decided to season the fish with lemon pepper and omit the additional salt.  It was quick and yummy, a definite do over.

Ok, but not the best.  I had the ingredients, and it sounded quick and easy, which it was, but I think the cheese, breadcrumb, and spice mixture over-powered the fish.  Not bad, but esp. on a hot day, I think I should have stuck with something lighter....

This was amazing!  DH, daughter and I loved it!  My son, who hates fish, tolerated it very well, and said it wasn't bad for fish. The breading was nice and crispy...a big change from most recipes I've found that end up being gloppy or soggy breading. Only thing I did differently was to brush with olive oil instead of butter, and omit the salt. The Parm was salty enough. This is a definite keeper! We love it!  Thank you for sharing.

Really loved this simple recipe!  I made it just as the recipe states except the salt.  The panko breadcrumbs I had on hand were seasoned and I really liked the flavor along with the parmesan.  I baked it for 18 minutes and was perfect.  This is a great topping for all kinds of fish that I will prepare often.  Thank you for the recipe!

It was awesome! Best flounder I ever cooked and super easy.  I did take advice from another review and added lemon pepper.  I first spread the melted butter over the fillets, then sprinkle the lemon pepper on top.  I then followed the directions above, just omitting the thyme because I don't really care for it.  It was a hit! Family loved it.  

Cant wait to make it again! Thanks

This  recipe sounded healthier and simpler than other flounder recipes on this site. But I knew it would be bland for me as is. So I went ahead and seasoned the fish with some Old Bay seasoning , garlic powder and lemon pepper. To cut the fat down, I used half butter and half avocado oil. Also, my fillets were very thin, so I used 8 of them and baked only for 10 minutes at 400 and broiled another 2 minutes ( the bread crumb mixture was plenty for all those fillets). And to make the cleaning a snap, I used my cookie sheet lined with foil. I served the fish with oven fries and a green salad.

I really liked this recipe , it was easy to make and easy to follow.  I did make some changes as I made just 2 filets and wanted to make it a little healthier too.  I added a little garlic powder, onion powder, tarragon, and smoked paprika to the panko and parmesan mixture.  I used parmesan shreds that were pretty good sized too.  Also to cut down on the butter I did not put any butter in the panko/parmesan crumb mixture. I brushed the filets with butter (vegan butter) and then added the panko/parmesan crumb mixture on top and pressed it down really good so it covered the fish really well too.   It turned out beautiful without using the broiler. It was nice and golden brown with a light crunch but great taste. I think the extra seasonings helped to flavor it. I read some other reviews that it needed more seasoning first so made a few changes that I noted here.  I think the parmesan shreds and panko browned nicely even without the butter mixed in the mixture. Will definitely make this again and I think this nice coating make it very kid friendly too.

Possibly the best flounder dish I've ever made. Followed the directions, but made a couple changes. Most importantly, I brushed the filets with 1 TBSP melted butter, but to reduce saturated fat, replaced the suggested 3 TBSP butter with 2 TBSP EVO to mix in the panko and grated parmesan. Didn't measure the amount of grated parmesan and panko; probably used well less than a full cup of panko. I like to season the fish directly, so I lightly sprinkled some garlic salt and pepper on the filets to our personal taste. Our filets were thin and each filet only weighed about 3 oz, so I baked the dish for about 12-13 minutes and then turned the broiler on for the last minute to two to nicely brown the topping as others suggested. The dish was outstanding! Will definitely make it again, often, and will also try other fish filets, adjusting the cooking time appropriately.

Fast, easy, and delicious. I used orange roughy. I went a little easier on the panko for my keto diet and heavier on the parmesan. I added Herbs de Provence. I buttered both sides of the fish instead of greasing the pan. Foil made clean up much easier. It's important to make sure the foil has no wrinkles to easily remove the fish with a spatula and to remove the fish immediately so it doesn't stick. The cheese will melt. I cooked my fish at 450 for 10 minutes until the crust was nicely browned and it was perfect. It was kind of like pizza fish. My teen loved it.

I made it tonight, it was great!  I omitted the thyme, add dill & lemon zest. I only made a half recipe of topping and that was plenty.

Came out even better than I expected! One of the most simple and best dishes for fish, especially if your wife isn't a big fan of fish!

Made this with some tilapia and it was great! The only change I made is that I left out the thyme and instead used 1T dry herbes de Provence. We ended up with way more crumb topping than fish but spread it around onto the broccoli we had with it and that was great too!

Hubby made this the other night for dinner and it was SO good!  My favorite meals - to make and to eat - are simple, few ingredients and straight forward.  This hit all my criteria and it was light & DELICIOUS.  And easy clean up to boot :-)  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  It is definitely being integrated into the rotation of favorite weeknight meals.

I'm only giving it 3 stars because I thought a cup of breadcrumbs and 2/3 of cheese was way too much. Next time I am going to only put a half cup of breadcrumbs and maybe omit the cheese or put wayy less. I smelled the cheese as it was cooking and the taste was very strong. Maybe I will just sprinkle the cheese on top for a little extra flavor.

DIVINE!!  I was looking for a quick recipe for flounder and ran across this gem.  It is perfect - my family couldn't eat enough.  After reading some of the reviews, I substituted lemon/pepper seasoning for the salt and it was absolutely delish.  Very light and dreamy.

This was so easy and good!  The thyme wasn't my favorite, but that can easily be swapped out.  The panko was very crispy and went well with the fish.  Will definitely do this again!

Excellent dish, I would have provided a photo of the finished dish but my brother and I devoured it before I could snap a photo.  The only adjustment I made was reduced grated parm to 1/3 C.  and used combination parm/asiago/romano.

Quick and super simple.
I thawed Wegmans frozen flounder filets. They‚Äôre very thin, so I was able to make 6 with lots of crust, and still had leftover panko mix. 
Baked 17 min to get the crust crunchier. 
Served with fresh squeezed lemon over it, white rice and broccoli.

This was sooo good!! The only change I made was I omitted the thyme and added Italian seasoning. I also used seasoned panko. I didn‚Äôt use any salt because of the Parmesan being salty enough for us.  I‚Äôll definitely make this again. My fish didn‚Äôt get soggy because I press between paper towels then stack on a plate with paper towels in between and put in fridge. This keeps the fish from getting soggy and mushy.

I had way more breadcrumbs than I needed for the wimpy fillets I got from the bag of frozen fish.  My guess is that had I bought at the counter, I would have had more substantial fillets.... So if making fish from a bag, you probably have enough breadcrumbs for six.

Fantastic flounder with just a few slight modifications... firstly there was no need to add salt, but instead I mixed in about a teaspoon of garlic powder to the melted butter and seasoned the bread crumb mixture with parsley. Also, I didn't use thyme or pepper.  It was so tasty and a hit at the dinner table. I served it with seasoned wild rice and spinach. Can't wait to make this again ! :)

Fish came out beautifully and will definitely make it again.   Only thing I changed was to only use half of the topping.   Would have been way too much for this delicate fish.

Nice straight forward recipe. I used Tilapia that had never been frozen and it was fine. Fresh thyme and a good, finely grated Parmesan makes all the difference.

I followed everything exactly and then added just a little lemon zest on each filet. This recipe is fantastic. Had a friend tell me it was the best fish he‚Äôd ever had. Can use with any other similar flaky white fish. I.e. tilapia, triggerfish, halibut.

Very good.  Could use a bit more spice influence.  Think it would be best with fresh (not frozen) flounder.  I used a frozen filet, completely thawed and allowed to drain as much as possible and dried.  Still was too mushy for my preference, but was tasty.

I made it and found it somewhat bland with far too many crumbs. The second time I tried it, I used only 2/3 c. of the panko crumbs, and I didn't use all of the entire mixture on the filets. This totally made the difference; it enhanced the fish taste and moisture.

This was fantastic!  I noticed when it was too late to turn back that I was out of panko and subbed Italian-seasoned regular breadcrumbs instead and it was still fabulous.  I'll definitely try it with the panko next time!

We are not fish people, unless it's fried. Age and health have changed things for us. :( 
This was the best ever! It was very easy and goodness it was tasty! Will be adding this to our weekly rotation.

I am not ashamed to admit that I am terrible at cooking fish. I'm never satisfied with the result. It either comes out too dry or yucky. Clearly, my history of cooking fish is not a positive one... until I came across this recipe. 

I cooked it close to as written (didn't add the extra salt), and it came out fantastic. I used frozen flounder filets that I thawed under cold running water. Before placing the filets on the pan, I dried them really well with paper towels. 

Although they were thin, I cooked the filets for the full 20 minutes. And, dear reader, I am happy to report that I finally made fish that me and my husband enjoyed, and that I would cook again. I cooked the filets on parchment paper, which made them easy to scoop up with a spatula. 

Fresh lemon is a must. Without it, the fish tasted bland. But with a good spritz of fresh lemon juice, it came alive. And, it feels like a personal triumph to make delicious homemade fish.

You can use several different types of fish as long as it is not too thick...and it is delicious and easy to make and hard to mess up.

Being a dairy free, gluten free household, I used a little bit of olive oil instead of butter and Ian‚Äôs GF panko  instead of wheat.  I also added a little nutritional yeast to impart a more ‚Äúbuttery‚Äù flavor and lemon pepper for plain.  Turned out really well.  With a little foil in the pan, some fresh asparagus and sweet potatoes to bake alongside the fish, quick meal, fast clean-up and healthy. My kind of meal!

Yes i followed other peoples reviews did not add salt, added fresh dill weed, only added half cup of parmesan cheese and lemon pepper. I was surprised how great it come out. I also put under broiler for about 1-2 minutes. Thanks to all who gave some very helpful reviews. I will make it again and again.

I was looking for an easy recipe for flounder filets for a lazy summer dinner. This was tasty, easy and both my husband and I enjoyed it.

I've read reviews that said it was a bit bland and other reviews that suggest broiling it for a minute after baking. This house loves flavor so I added a little cajun seasoning, paprika, garlic powder, a dash of lemon pepper and old bay then broiled it for a minute on the top rack after 10 minutes of baking (I had prefrozen thin cuts). Broiling is a must to get that nice crispy texture. My family loved it. Even my very picky 5 yr old finished his quickly. Will make this again.

This is a good recipe with minimal ingredients. I had to modify it to use my gluten-free bread crumbs, which I substituted for the panko. But I forgot to adjust the quantity considering the volume of the panko vs. the traditional breadcrumbs... the result was a crumb-heavy dish. My fault. Still tasty though. I really needed less than half the total breading mixture, so I bagged the rest for next time. Also my GF breadcrumbs were seasoned 'Italian' style so I omitted the spices shown, including salt. But my butter on hand was salted. I'd suggest unsalted butter for this recipe, which I will use next time. Along with fewer crumbs! Nice delicate flavor. My teenage son also liked it. A bit too salty or else I'd say 5 stars.

Made this with Cod.  So good!!  nice crunchy and flavorful breading.  The breading made a lot, enough for 5-6 pieces of fish.

Very tasty and easy. Too much salt though. Parmesan has salt and so does butter. Next time I'd skip salt altogether and just sprinkle a little lemon pepper instead.

I‚Äôm not a big flounder fan. But this was good. I followed the recipe as is. Except I had no breadcrumbs. So I used some plain organic potato chips. I made sure they were all ground up well. It turned out really well. I will make this again for sure.

I added some old bay seasoning with the thyme to give the fish a little more flavor. I also omitted the salt & did not melt the butter. I mixed the butter with the bread & cheese & then sprinkled like a crumb topping. It was delicious.

This was so easy - and so good!  I did make some changes based on what I had on hand and on other reviews.  I had 2 frozen tilapia filets and one frozen flounder (both thawed) so that's what I went with - and just halved the crumb mixture-it was perfect. I melted the butter in my casserole dish (omitted extra salt, but used salted butter), poured most of it into the bowl with the bread crumbs (seasoned Italian...what I had)  and Parmesan (omitted thyme since used seasoned crumbs).  I coated the filets with the remaining melted butter in the casserole dish and then sprinkled the crumbs on top.  The fish was tender and the crumbs crispy and yummy in 15 minutes.

This is such a good and easy recipe. We eat a lot of fish and this pleases both my family and company. All ingredients are always on hand so it can be ready really quickly. I make it exactly as written with really good shredded parm from Costco. Sometimes I substitute crushed bread crumbs for the panko.. Either works just fine. Try it!!

I will definitely make this again. Was a hit with the whole family, and so nice and easy! The only thing I would mention is to not line your pan with tin foil, because the topping really crisps up to the extend that I was shredding the tin foil trying to get the fillets off of the pan...it was sticking to the bottom (even though I did spray the foil). Next time I'll just do it straight on the pan and it will be easier.

I brushed flounder with less than one TBS of olive oil and used Land o' Lake Lite butter and canola oil rather than full butter.  We will be making this again and again!

I love flounder but can't get it on the west coast. While visiting my daughter in Philadelphia, we found fresh flounder fillets in her local market, and looked for a simple recipe. I made this one and we both loved it! I didn't change a thing and will definitely make it again! I'll just need to substitute another fish available in Southern California!

My Son and I love this recipe.    A few additions.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon if granulated garlic to the butter.  and I substituted in Dill for the thyme.     We will definitely be making again.

I love this. It is so easy, so tasty, just perfect. I bought my flounder straight from the docks in Longport, NJ, and the fish smells like  flowers and the dish is perfect with a sunset over the beach.

I bought flounder on sale and was looking for a different way to make it and found this recipe.  Only thing that I changed was omitting the salt since I should not be eating a lot of salt and I used Locatelli Pecorino Romano cheese instead of parmesan.  My husband and I both liked it and I agree with other reviewers that it was on the bland side, which was OK with us because my husband is on a bland diet right now.  Folks who prefer bolder flavors could add other spices to the topping.  I will make this again and maybe add other spices to the topping.

No changes. Baked 20 minutes longer to  brown. This is the closest iv'e come to the fried taste without adding oil. I've found the Parmesan might just replace the fried taste i long for..

Followed the recipe exactly. Love the panko it made the fish so crispy and moist. I served it with long string beans and Knorr side dish Herb and butter white rice. My husband really enjoyed it.  Great taste.  Will make it again.

This fish recipe is fabulous!  I have made it with both Panko crumbs and corn flake crumbs and my family prefers the corn flake crumbs (so do I).  I fixed this for my mom while she was in hospice and was so happy that, even though her appetite was diminishing, she ate a complete meal and asked for seconds.  This will always be a special memory for me that her last real meal was so thoroughly enjoyed and I was able to fix it for her.  As for me, I crave this dish at times!  In fact, I think I'll make it tomorrow night.  Oh, and this recipe is great using cod, too.

Read other reviews so sprinkled the fish with lemon/pepper seasoning and some dill, then mixed the topping for 5 flounder filets - did not add the salt.  The flavor was great, the topping was almost too much but it baked/flaked off at serving.  Looks great on a plate, great flavor and served with some rice and peas.  So easy and delicious!

I omitted the thyme, (not a fan), and substituted  lemon pepper. Oh, and I broiled it for the last 2 minutes to give it a nice buttery crunch. Delish! Thanks so much for sharing. It's a keeper for sure.

Made a small change, did not use thyme (dislike it).  Used a citrus spice blend instead it was somewhat bland.  Next time will add some lemon slices.

I was disappointed. The amount of topping was way too much for these delicate fillets. I much prefer to cook my fish just with a light coating of seasoned flour and sautee in butter, and add lemon and capers.

I've made this twice now, and loved it both times.  I deleted salt, but followed the recipe otherwise.   I believe that any dish can only be as good as the ingredients used to make it, and that this is an absolute when preparing fish, so I used fresh wild-caught flounder from the best seafood market in town.  I served it with lemon wedges.  Also, I recommend checking internal temperature with a meat thermometer after 15 minutes, to avoid drying out the flounder.  The fish is perfectly done at 145 degrees Fahrenheit.   This is now my go-to flounder recipe.  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

Even my non-fish lovers liked it. Quick and easy! Added some garlic powder to the panko for a little extra flavor. Will definitely make this again.

loved it just the way it is written. I did lay out the fish on paper towels and salt just to make sure the fish had released all the moisture. Wonderful recipe.

I didn't have any flounder so I used some frozen cod. I followed the steps exactly, brushing the butter on and topping it with the crumb mixture. They taste like a grown up fish sticks. My husband already asked me to make them again.

The breading was tasty but the recipes called for WAY too much. It buried the taste of the fish so I felt like I was eating bread crumbs with a touch of fish flvoring. A little tweaking and it could be a tasty dish.

I live with a guy who thinks fish is those frozen fish sticks that are way bad for you.  Till he tasted this!   I used italian breadcrumbs and didn't have thyme.  It was super good.  Next time I won't use all of the cheese/crumbs since I only make 2 large pieces.  WAY good!!!  Since we love mac n cheese so much, if I serve it with this fish, I do cut back on the cheese.

The first time I made this, I used olive oil instead of butter, and I used shredded asiago cheese. My family loved it. I usually have a hard time getting my kids to eat fish, but they were asking for seconds before their first serving was done. I made it again with butter and shredded (not grated) parmesan, with the same response. Delicious!

Great recipe. Have made it twice, I used low salt Italian bread crumbs, added a part/Romano blend, added thyme and "hydrated" the crumb topping with EVO instead of butter. I didn't want the mix to be too buttery or fatty as this detracts from the taste of a delicate fish such as Scrod. Got great reviews each time!

Excellent and couldn't be easier! Made it with melted butter (unsalted), panko, parmesan, pepper, garlic powder, and dried parsley. A hit with all four kids, three of whom think they hate fish. 20 min at 400 was perfect. And I loved the ease, lack of dishes to do after, and the ability to focus on a yummy side dish while this was cooking. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Wonderful!  I used frozen flounder and drained it on paper towels.  I dipped the bottom in the breading mixture, and then placed them in the dish and added the rest on top.  I also sprinkled a little extra Parmesan cheese and gave it a little drizzle of melted butter.  It came out very crisp and tasty.  It's a regular on my menu rotation.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was wonderful!  This is the first time I've even made or eaten baked flounder.  I was skeptical since I love FRIED seafood.  But I'm trying to branch out and find healthier alternatives to my beloved fried fares.  I did omit the salt as some others suggested, and used a salt-free lemon pepper seasoning in lieu of the pepper.  I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs in stead of plain panko.  Will definitely be keeping this recipe on hand to use again!

This is such a tasty and simple recipe. Very quick and easy to make. Everyone loves it at my house. I make a lot of the topping and freeze it. I use that topping on chicken too. I spice it up with ginger, red pepper, paprika, cumin, and coriander by mixing those spices in bowl, and taste them before I mix them with the breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese. I can use the spicy mix for the adults and the original mix for the kids, and keep both topics in the freezer. I use unseasoned bread crumbs instead of panko. Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed others suggestions on lemon pepper instead of thyme, no salt, add garlic powder, broiling at end, drying fish with paper towels after thawing.  The recipe is a keeper - super easy & tasty.

I made this but used Italian breadcrumbs because that's what I had.  I pressed the fish into the crumb mixture on both sides and then sprinkled the remainder on top.  I finished it off under the broiler so it would crisp.  Everyone loved it!

This recipe was so easy and absolutely delicious! The fish was very moist. I will probably reduce the salt next time, as the flavor of the cheese is plenty.

Went to get Panko, and it was all gone.  So, I mixed up some crackers in the food processor.  

This was delicious!  I will make the recipe again.

this was absolutely delicious! i used tilapia bc it was on sale.. we're normally not big tilapia fans but this was fantastic.. i subbed margarine for butter and regular bread crumbs for the panko.. left out the salt and thyme.. halved the amounts for the butter/bread crumb/parm mixture and sprinkled lemon pepper on top.. ty so much for the recipe

This is a good recipe.  I like to put my flounder on a bed of fresh spinach with a little olive oil and lemon drizzled on top with some Italian herbs and tonight I added a tomato that was  ripe and needed to be used.  That gives me an entire meal, but I'm adding a baked yam to round it out.  It's awesome baked in my cast iron skillet!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I needed to make mine gluten free.  Finely crushed Rice Chex for the Panko worked well.  I think I would rather use a more sturdy fish.  We loved the crust.

I made this exactly as called for and everyone in my family, including me loved it.  The fish was done perfectly and the topping came out crunchy and was so good that we mixed some with our veggies as we ate it.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

My children and husband ate this right up! I could barely get the broccoli and potatoes on their plates before they were finished! I put fresh thyme from my garden in my bread crumb mixture. I only had seasoned, but next time I'll use panko since my kids like it better, anyway. I used 1/2 tsp. of coarse sea salt in mine, but I recommend using less since the parmesan cheese is also salty. You could also cut back on salt with unsalted butter (as I used salted), not that it was too salty, and I do love salt, it's just that I thought it was a bit much. I am making this again for sure! Don't forget your lemon wedges!

Didn't have panko so used some Italian breadcrumbs and added a small amount of grated aged parmesan. Delicious. Quick and easy oven meal.  Roasted some garlic asparagus at the same time.

I made no changes to this recipe.  5 Stars for ease and 5 more for taste.  A very simple and tasty way to make flounder.  I can't wait to try this on a thicker whitefish.

I made this tonight and loved it. I usually don't make alterations/substitutions, but a couple were out of necessity. I was out of Panko and thyme, so I had to substitute seasoned breadcrumbs and parsley. After reading the reviews, I left out the half teaspoon salt because Parmesan cheese is pretty salty on its own. I really wanted to add lemon juice, but since I was out of that too, I poured about 1/4 or so of white wine into the pan and on the fish before patting on the breadcrumbs. WOW! It turned out to be the BEST baked flounder I've had in a long time. I will definitely be making it again.

Delicious delicious!!!! I didn't follow the exact measurements, it asked for way too much butter and Panko so I just used less. This was so easy and it is definitely a keeper

Turned out well, the topping crispy and the fish perfectly cooked. The primary issue is the seasoning.  With so much Parmesan cheese, there is absolutely no need for added salt.  Take out the added salt, cut the Parmesan cheese to 1/4 cup and it all evens out a bit better.  I went with lemon pepper as some other reviewers had done and that added to the dish.  Flounder is such a simple, delicate fish, so it's easy to overpower it with too much of anything.  Keep the recipe as is, and the salt content is far too high.  Reduce it, and it's spot on.  Quick prep, easy to make, and perfect with a baked potato.

I thought the recipe turned out well.  It had good flavor.  It did taste a bit salty.  So the next time I make it I will not add any salt.

This is a really good and simple recipe, and it's also very easy to customize to your own tastes. I always like to add lemon pepper, paprika, and some type of herb like dill or basil.

Good Flavor -- flounder is a bit mushy, but this was an easy recipe.  My family liked it as they took seconds and finished it up. I did add a little lemon pepper to it and made a quick dipping sauce of lemon juice and catsup.

We had some flounder that we weren't excited about because whitefish just seem to have no flavor. This is definitely the best recipe for flounder! My husband complained that we were having flounder, but by the end of dinner, he was stealing some off my plate! I used organic coconut oil instead of butter and added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning.

Incredibly simple to make. I substituted Old Bay seasoning for the salt, pepper and thyme. This was delicious. I got lucky at Sam's Club. They were liquidating 3 lb bags of flounder for 51 cents a bag! I got 15 lbs. of flounder for $2.55. I'm sure I'll be making this recipe a few more times! Quick. Easy. Delicious.

Cooked 4 filets that totaled about .8 pounds for 18 minutes.  Perfect.

This cooked exactly as directed. I thought the flavor was terrific. The only thing I suggest is to use less panko, and instead of covering the fish, coat the fish with the Panko. Just a preference. The flounder was delicious.

Very good-only didnt mix the butter and panko together. Sprinkled fish with lemon pepper, butter, fresh parm. and panko! Had to broil for 2 minutes to get brown and crispy...my son even liked it!

This is my first try at baking fish, and it was easy and delicious!  I altered the recipe slightly, omitting the butter and using a quick spray of olive oil instead.  Loved it!

I just made this tonight,  and it is so yummy. The recipe is so easy, I let my 5 year old help me. The only thing I did differently is I added more parmesan cheese to the mix, and used lemon juice as well. She loved it, so it must get 5 stars! Kid-approved!

Pretty good - reminds me of the parmesan crusted tilapia I got at Red Lobster once.  I do agree with the others though, you don't need the whole recipe.  Half would be fine.  I wasted about 1/3 cup of real parm making this recipe.

Very good and easy for a weeknight meal. Recipe made WAY too much topping for four fillets though. Will halve the topping recipe next time or the taste is more topping than flounder.

This was very tasty & easy to prepare. Next time I won't add any salt though. The parm cheese & butter had enough salt for the entire recipe, but the flounder was very moist. Will def make again.

OMG! This was amazing! So easy! I used frozen flounder, so I just had to cook it a little longer. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! Buttery and crunchy! Excellent!

This was such a delicious recipe!  Such a change of pace from basic recipes with broiling with lemon juice.  I didn't have to even add lemon juice like I normally do with fish dishes!  Panko and Parmesan cheese was a delight.  Will definitely make it again!

Made this last night - really good and quick to make. I backed off on the butter a bit but it still came out really tasty.  I also used parsley instead of thyme (just a preference), and added some garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture. This would work well with any mild fish fillet.

Flounder, Haddock, Talapia are great mild fillets.  With this recipe, I omitted the salt, reduced the parmesan cheese (I use only to help the panko crumbs stick to the flounder) and ... added a little less then a 1/2 tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning.  Any fish you can amp up the flavor to remind you of Chesapeake Bay crabs, is a winner in these parts! lol

I was looking for a simple recipe for flounder, and this was a GRAND SLAM! So simple, fast-- yet absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but since I grated more parmesan than was called for, probably put more in...my son, the pickiest 8 year old on the planet, took a bite and begged for more. YUM!! Served it with broiled asparagus and a very spicy habanero "pesto" and mexican limon slices. (spice for husband and myself). Delish.

I didn't have panko crumbs, so used Italian bread crumbs instead.  Delicious!  Definitely a keeper, though found the topping to be too much, will cut in half next time.

Excellent.  I got a good deal on some flounder at the local supermarket and made a few pounds with this recipe.  It came out great.

Very easy and tasty.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Would have given it five starts, but I agree with others that this needs some additional seasoning as it's very bland.  I'm gluten-free and used GF panko bread crumbs, which worked just as well as regular.  The fish itself was perfectly baked.  Next time I'll add basil, oregano, fresh parsley, and serve lemon wedges.

Really very good and easy! Used seasoned panko and 1/2 the Parmesan since it was all I had. Didn't use any salt and it was perfectly seasoned. Baked 15 mins in top 1/3 of oven and it was nice & crisp & browned.

This was tasty, but definitely too much topping for our family.  I doubled the amount of fish, so I doubled the topping, but I wish I had read the reviews before I made it and I wouldn't have needed to double the topping!  The flavor was good, but just too much breading.

This was a great treat! Flavorful, and VERY tender!!! I tweaked it a little by adding more cheese, about a fist full, a pinch of sea salt from the grinder, and once it was done, I put it under the broiler for about 3 min just to brown. It was NOWHERE near dry, and was very flavorful! Glad I tried it, and of course it's so much better than frying!!

I tweeked the recipe a little. I sampled this using 3 different kinds of fish.  I used Flounder, Swai/Basa, and Tilapia. Tilapia was my favorite. I actually liked the Flounder the least. I did not add any salt to the mixture. I used a Garlic Herb Salt Free Seasoning and salted butter. Next time I would use unsalted butter. I think there was enough salt in the cheese to cover it. I would also cover the dish with foil to allow the fish to completely cook inside then uncover to brown the crumbs. I did not have to use the broiler to brown. The fish had a great flavor and I would certainly try it again! Hope this helps someone!

Flounder is one of my favorite fish, but this recipe ruined it. There wasn't flavor to it. We had it for lunch before he had to go into work and ended up having to eat hot pockets...sad to say a frozen hot pocket was better than this.
