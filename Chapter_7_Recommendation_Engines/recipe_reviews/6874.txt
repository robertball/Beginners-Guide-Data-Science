These muffins were really tasty. I baked them just as the recipe said. I used 1 cup of shredded coconut in the batter. I then topped them off with some chopped pecans and more shredded coconut. Yummy!

TIP - To get your batter to dome, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. As soon as you put the muffin batter in the oven, reduce the heat to what the recipe says. The initial high heat causes the batter to have greater oven spring or the rapid rise during the first few minutes of baking.

GREAT!!!   I changed it a little I used 1/2 cup of milk and 3/4 cup of applesauce instead of oil.
Also I added a small mashed banana to the batter.
Fill the muffin cups half full and add some chopped stawberries to some, chopped apples to some and dried blueberries to have a little variety.   A great on-the-go breakfast for my husband who is on the road all day.

Excellent base recipe for all kinds of muffins. It adapted really well so several substitutions:  I used vanilla soy milk in place of milk, and honey in place of sugar.  I also added two bananas, cinnamon, and sprinkled oatmeal on top.  They turned out fabulous!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the upmost delicious muffin recipe!! I had to bake for a bake sale. I made these, and they sold very QUICK! So easy and so versable! Our favorite it adding about 1 cup smashed banana and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, added cinnamon and vanilla. I spray my muffin tins with Pam instead of using the liners. You can be so creative with these... with different fruits/jams/preserves and/or veggies/meat and/or cheeses and spices! Thank you SOOOOOO much  Lori for posting this recipe! This is a keeper and it has become a family recipe! We give you 12 thumbs up from all 6 of us! This ROCKS!!!! Mmmmmmm!! Oh... I bake them at 350 for 30 minutes.

THESE WERE SOOOOO GOOD! I SUBSTITUTED 4OZ OF APPLESAUCE FOR THE OIL, EGG BEATERS FOR THE EGG, & USED SKIM MILK. FOR THE BATCH I MADE LAST NIGHT, I USED SOME LEFT OVER DRIED PEACHES ALONG WITH SOME CANNED PEACHES & A LITTLE OF THE JUICE, CHOPPED UP IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR. I ADDED A LITTLE CINNAMON TO THE MIX & SPRINKLED THE TOP W/CINNAMON SUGAR BEFORE BAKING! TASTED JUST LIKE PEACH COBBLER!! I THINK I WILL USE SOME OF MY HOMEMADE BLACKBERRY PRESERVES IN THE NEXT BATCH!

Very easy recipe!  I tried a savory muffin first using cheddar, bacon and garlic and would definately cut down on the sugar.  3/4 cup is way too much for a savory muffin.  As a blueberry or chocolate chip, they're perfect!

Excellent recipe. For those watching their fat intake, I used no fat sour cream instead of the
oil, and it makes them very moist. I also throw in some frozen blueberries for the antioxidant benefit, and hey, they taste great too! A keeper recipe.

Excellent muffin recipe! This is a fantastic base. I only added strawberry jam to the mix, first mixing some into the batter, then adding a little extra and just swirling it, not blending it. Wonderful!
To those who are calling this recipe "bland", they are only bland according to what YOU add to it. It is just a base recipe. So blandness is no one else's fault but your very own... Also, I must add, to those who say they followed the recipe "exactly" but the muffins burned, didn't cook, whatever - then you did NOT follow the recipe exactly. The final step specifically says: Bake 25 minutes OR UNTIL GOLDEN. That means it could be more or less time, depending on your oven. 
I'm not trying to be rude, but some people here were quite rude, in that they automatically blame the recipe submitter before realising it was their own fault. 
I am eating one of these freshly baked muffins right now, Lori, and they are simply wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

These are great muffins!  I just throw in whatever I've got that needs to get used up, and everyone loves them every time.  You can add a lot of nutritional value by adding things like wheat germ and bran.

These were far from being the "best ever", they were just basic muffins. I added 1/2 cup chocolate chip and increased vanilla extract, and they were just ok. Next time, I'll try to mix it even less and to bake them for only 20 minutes, maybe I'll like them better this way. P.S.: if you want excellent muffins, try the "best of the best blueberry muffins" recipe on this site; even plain (whithout any blueberry), these taste great.

This recipe is super easy and you can do just about anything you want to it.  I found the batter to be more like dough.  I   made the batter two ways.  With the first batch I thinned it out so that it looked like a batter instead of a dough and with the second I left it alone more or less.  It actually worked better when it was doughy.
For the variations I made one batch with chocolate chips and a little vanilla.  The second I made garlic, herb, and cheddar muffins.  I reduced the sugar to 2 TBSP and added 1 cup cheddar, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp italian seasoning.  I should have upped the salt to about 1tsp as well.  I think it needs it.  I also topped the muffins with a little cheddar before putting them in the oven.  Pretty good!  I'll be using this recipe lots!  Thanks!

Amazing Recipe! They came out so delicious. I didn't have much in my cupboard or fridge so I just added a few tablespoons of cinnamon and they came out great.

Because I halved the recipe I just used 1 egg white (also to make them lower fat) and I also used skim milk. They're still super rich and delicious.

I DID follow the review that said to turn the oven up to make them domed... I probably won't do that again. They didn't dome and they just burned on the bottom!

I truly enjoy cooking, and recipes like this one are the reason why. What a great recipe!!! I knew I wanted to try it after reading all the great reviews. I opened a jar of home-canned peaches  and added one cup (chopped, w/ a little juice) to the mix, topped w/ cinnamon & sugar, and baked as directed. Best peach cobbler-tasting muffin I ever had!! I really like that the possibilities are endless & can't wait to try other varieties. This is the ONLY muffin recipe you will need. Trust me.

These are wonderful. I added bacon and cheese for breakfast on the run. I followed a previous review and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, which was plenty. I think next time I'll add a little more salt.

I was so excited I didnt screw it up I made a few batches. I've already sent this one to a few family and friends.  Thank you for this one! :)

First of all, thanks for a great recipes that you can have fun with by making them exactly as the recipe, or to your liking. I couldn't sleep, so around 3am  I decided to make these muffins, as I copied it down earlier, I added 1 small gala apple, finely chopped from my chopper, cinnamon and mace, as I like the two together, a dash of vanilla extract, and a dash of lemon and orange zest, after mixing it up, I added 1/4 cup frozen blueberries. The recipe says not to beat this and it will be lumpy, well, I beat it slowly and no lumps. I got 15 big muffins out of this and I had 1 before serving later on for breakfast, and it was just perfect and soooo good. They were moist and not dry at all. I will make these many times over, next time, exact,and again adding this and that, I hope they are good for everyone who trys this, its truly worth the time and a true keeper, thanks again!!!!

What a terrific basic muffin recipe! I made a double batch and then split the batter into four bowls and made the following variations: fresh strawberry with almond extract added and nutmeg, banana with cinnamon, banana with choc chips and pecans (& vanilla extract), and blueberry (frozen).  They were all fantastic! Fluffy and not brick-like (like some other recipes I have tried). Before baking I sprinkled with turbinado sugar and cinnamon or nutmeg, and baked right in a pam-sprayed muffin tin, this turned out better than muffin cups for me.  Yummy!

Wonderful recipe. I made Peanut Butter and Jelly muffins! I added 3/4 cup peanut butter chips to the batter, filled each cup halfway, then added a teaspoonful of blackberry jam, and topped with more batter. I baked in a greased muffin pan for 20 minutes at 400 and they came out perfect. 12 muffins.

Best ever muffins is no empty boast.  I didn't know how to make muffins, now I do and they're great.  I use walnut oil in them and this adds a nice nutty flavour.  Yummy!  Thanks Lori!

Very easy recipe and delicious muffins.  Never made muffins before.  I made them with frozen blueberries (not in season) and they were the hit of breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe as i can add anthing in want to it. My kids love it also, as i have made Mixed Nut Muffins, Banana Muffins, Papaya Muffins, Mixed Fruit Muffins, Carrot Muffins, Cconut Muffins and all sorts of different ingredients. Thank you for an easy muffin mix as this was the only place you can get it from.

Excellent recipe!  I added one large shredded apple (about a cup) and one tsp cinnamon.  The baking time was perfect and the muffins came out moist and tasty.

These muffins rock!  They are box-quality without all the mysterious ingredients and stuff you can't pronounce.  I mixed in about 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips and my children loved them. I needed more than 12 muffins so I increased all ingredients by a half (except eggs-made them 2), they were perfect, thanks Lori!

These were the BEST EVER muffins. This was my first time ever baking muffins so I was nervous.  But it was so simple. I didn't have the paper cups so I spayed Pam cooking oil on the pan. I only made them plain so far but I am planning on using blueberries. Sprinkling cinnamon and sugar on the top before baking is sooooo good. I would reccomend these to any one. Thank you so much Lori!!!

I really enjoyed these muffins. However, I made them with just 1/2 cup sugar as I was filling mine with chocolate chips and raisins (and they turned out sweet enough, just as I expected). I'll be trying a batch with pomegranates soon and another one with tuna and black olives for a party I'll be attending soon.

This is just the recipe I looked for! I doubled the recipes, cut down on the sugar and added blueberries. I baked them in muffin tins and they came out great (crisp on the outside, not too sweet and moist on the inside! This is a perfect basic muffins recipe :)

I made a few standard changes to the recipe like adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract, using 1/2 yogurt & 1/3 buttermilk & cutting back on the oil for more fruit moisture. If these came out dry or lacked flavor for you try this, mine were moist. A reviewer suggested baking these at 350 for half an hour & I did that. I thought they came out great that way. I have issues when baking my muffins at 400. Probably just my bad apt oven though. :( I made them Strawberry Chocolate Chip muffins by taking about a cup of frozen strawberries, somewhat thawed & pureeing with 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 strawberry jam. I was concerned that the strawberries had too much liquid in them but when I mixed it up it looked ok. I put my chocolate chips in a bag with a scant 1/4 flour & shook them up and poured the chips and extra flour in, folding it together gently. I figured that much flour would help the extra berry liquid if it was an issue. 

The muffins came out great. Delicious & tender. They stuck quite a bit to the paper cupcake cups but after letting them sit in my cupcake/muffin keeper they steamed a little and the paper slid of easily. The only change I'd make when doing these in the future would be to keep my berries diced up. The bits would have been delicious. I'll try adding other fruit and ingredients like 3/4 c apples and 1/3 raisins w/ apple pie spice. 

So far these have been my favorite muffin recipe to work with. They actually worked & even worked well with all my kooky changes!!!

AWESOME! I was so happy to find a good base recipe because messing around with different flavors is my thing. The first time that I made these I made pecan pie muffins. I used 3/ cup milk and 1/4 cup apple cider, cinnamon, apple sauce for the oil, vanilla, and candied pecans (pralines). I only used 2 tbs. of sugar because the nuts were covered in sugar. They poofed up HUGE and beautiful. I will be using this recipe for MANY, MANY more variations.

A wonderful recipe! I made a batch of orange chocolate chip muffins. I substituted 1/2 of the milk with orange juice, 1/4 of the white sugar with brown sugar, one orange's worth of zest, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/2 a cup of mini chocolate chips (it was all I had left in the bag). The key is to not overmix. Overmixing will result in a tough muffin rather than fluffy, moist muffins. This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper!

This recipe turns out some GREAT muffins!  I love to add 3/4 cup cinnamon chips, three chopped apples, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the mixture.  I've also added some crumbled bacon, cheddar cheese, and green onions, with less sugar than called for, and it's just GREAT!  I have gotten so many compliments on this recipe!  PLUS, it's really easy to make!

this is a great, solid, basic muffin recipe.  i have made beautiful muffins each time (about 5 times now), but they are not as moist as i'd like them.  next time i'll try substituting applesauce for oil and see how they turn out.

I'm not sure what went wrong but something did.
I made the basic recipe and added 1 cup of mini chocolate chips.
It never seemed to cook through and were
somewhat too dense.  I want to try them again, allowing them to cook longer than the alloted time and maybe use fruit instead of chocolate chips.
I was so disappointed since I promised these muffins to the children of a friend of mine!!

Easy, and made from ingredients I regularly have on hand. Great with fruit but also good filled with jam or fruit topping in a pinch - just adjust the sugar amount.

I tried this recipe out for a large buffet I had an order for, and needed an easy recipe that I can adapt to whatever fruits I had on hand to save me time. First batch I added chocolate chips and the second I added blueberries. I have been baking for years and have been in the catering business as well... The oil that the recipe calls for makes the muffins rubbery and dry. The recipe also lacks in the flavor department. The tastes were very bland and way too sweet. I think they should give this recipe an overhaul and re-rate it. I would definitely use fresh buttermilk in place of regular milk and add about 2 sticks of butter. I would also decrease the sugar amount and perhaps add a bit of brown sugar for moistness. The original recipe is tasteless and by adding oil it gives it a fishy smell. The best baked goods start with butter, milk, and flour with some sugar... Not good with oil. Also, if making blueberry muffins you need to add sour cream and a little bit of lemon zest. Makes them way more tasty. Am I the only one with this not so grand turn out? I hope my suggestions help others.

Exactly the kind of versatile muffin recipe I've been looking for. Made one batch, added 1 tsp. vanilla, and divided it in half; added 1/2 cup frozen drained blueberries to one half and 1/2 mashed banana to the other half. It made exactly 48 mini muffins. GREAT!

I've always used Duncan Hines bakery-style blueberry muffin mix, but I think this simple recipe is just as easy and tastes much better. I made it this morning using less sugar because I added blueberries & a brown sugar/crumb topping, BUT next time I think I'll make it with all the sugar. It has melt-in-your-mouth texture and also bakes up beautifully. I made 6 large muffins and they look like bakery. In the future I might try using melted butter in place of the oil to see how that works, but frankly I think the recipe is perfect as written.

Great muffins!!! I've enjoyed trying different variations of this muffin recipe. So far, there's been no problems with adding different ingredients to the basic mix. My favourite is banana chocolate chip muffins! I usually add two smaller bananas, that I mash up first, then add about a cup of chocolate chips. Yummy! For me they bake for exactly 20 minutes - any longer and they're over cooked.

Wonderful! Substituted 50g (slightly under 1/5 cup) of flour with cocoa powder, butter for 1/2 the oil and added 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1 tsp of vanilla extract to get a rich chocolatey muffin. Chocoholic heaven!

This recipe is fantastic! I have made it countless time with every warying ingredients. My favourite by far is doing the batter plain and filling the muffin cups with half of it and then adding 2 tbsp unsweetended cocoa powder to the other half. Then I top up the muffin tins with the brown cocoa batter and mix the two of the together with a fork. The end result ooks impressive and tastes really good. 

I do add less sugar to my recipe though, I find the full amount to be too much.

Wow!  These turned out beautifully and were delicious, too.  I own an espresso cafe and bakery and for the past five years I've been looking for the perfect muffin base.  In the meantime, I've used a muffin mix that I buy from my bakery vendor.  But no longer.  From now on our muffins will be 'from scratch.'  Today I made a batch each of blueberry, strawberry, peach, apple cinnamon and lemon poppyseed.  They all turned out great.  Thanks, Lori!

Horrible, horrible, horrible.  No flavor at all (and this was *after* I added chopped canned peaches and cinnamon to the batter and sprinkled brown sugar on the tops), and a gummy consistency.  My roommate and I both hated them -- they went right into the garbage.

I wanted to make a savory muffin for quick breakfasts. I subbed 1 cup of wheat flour for 1 cup of the white and only used 1/4 cup of sugar. Added two scrambled eggs, 1/4 cup mozzarella, 6 oz cooked italian sausage, and 1/4 cup of mushrooms. They came out perfect! Not crumbly at all, and not dense or cakey. Truly a winner!

This is a very good basic recipe. I added in two banannas. I also added the topping from the "To die for blueberry muffins" to these, which made them very extra special.

BEST, MOST VERSATILE BASIC BREAD/MUFFIN/PANCAKE RECIPE I'VE EVER FOUND!.....Yes, even pancakes can be made with this recipe, and they are divine!  In fact, I find this recipe absolutely indispensible, and use it at least weekly.

This is the only recipe I use for making pancakes anymore.  I have a household of Celiac sufferers (we cannot have anything containing gluten, which is a protein found in all wheat, barley, rye and most anything derived from them) and cooking for us is tough! We have to make all baked goods, pastas, etc. from scratch using mixtures of odd flours to replace basic white flour.  It's very difficult to find recipes which are seemingly "foolproof" for Celiac sufferers, but this is one of them!  My changes (posted for fellow Celiacs) are as follows:...........replace 2 cups flour with either two cups Betty Hagman's gluten-free featherlight flour (rice/tapioca/cornstarch mix. Google if needed). You can also use 1 1/2 cups featherlight flour + 1/2 cup buckwheat or sorghum. Both taste great, although the sorghum will require a binder like Xantham gum to keep it from being too crumbly).  Also, I replace the regular milk with soy milk, and add a bit more (like 1 1/2) for pancakes.  Also add in some vanilla or lemon extract for flavor.  You can reduce the sugar to 1/4-1/2 for pancakes, as well.  It turns out terrific every time, whether making muffins, bread or pancakes.  Add in two extra eggs and thin the batter for crepes!~~~~~~Thanks a million for sharing thi

Just what I was looking for - a basic recipe!  I did swap 1/2 the whit flour for wheat and 1/2 splenda for the sugar so my diabetic mother could eat them, and mixed up 4 batches of dry ingredients in baggies to make weekly muffin baking even easier than mixes.  SUPER!

This is the first time I made this. I added the 1 cup of cheese and omitted the sugar because I wanted a strictly savory cheese muffin. I made sure to mix the batter as little as possible. The muffin batter was thick and very lumpy almost like drop biscuit dough. Do NOT try pressing the batter down when you are filling the muffin papers in the tin it will make a dense muffin. These muffins rose gorgeously in my oven-it only took 18 minutes for mine to bake so keep an eye on your oven. The texture is lovely and fluffy. I would definitely add 1/2 to a cup more cheese in the batter and add more on the top next time and add some garlic powder and maybe dried parsley. I might even add some jalapenos and bacon too for more flavor. Overall a great base. It's a keeper.

Just OK. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon and used about 1/4 cup dried blueberries, 1/8 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract. They were sweet enough for me and had an OK taste but I was very disappointed with the texture. It was not muffin like at all. The hunt continues.

These muffins are very easy to make.  I had a bag of frozen berries that needed to be used up - I defrosted the fruit ahead of time and mushed with a fork before mixing in to the batter.  I followed a previous comment to heat the oven to 425 first, then reduce to 400 when you put the muffins in.  This seemed to be a good strategy - the muffins were a perfect shape when finished.  I will make these again with other add-ins.  Also, I did not use paper cups, just sprayed the cups in the pan with non-stick spray.

4 and a half stars. WOW i was hesistant to make this "best ever muffin" b/c it had so little ingredients compared to other muffin recipes. it was incredible. i made half a dozen. for the one cup flour i filled the cup little more than 3/4 with flour, then topped the rest with oatmeal. only used 1/4 cup sugar, 1 egg, added half a mashed, overripe banana (added a great moistness and a heavenly smell after the muffins were finished). instead of adding the bluebrries to the batter, i poked about 8 directly into each of the filled cups of the muffin tray. preheated to 425 like Katie said, then turned it down to 375 right when i put the muffins in b.c it smelled like they were burning at 400. set the oeven timer to about 22 min so you can check on the muffins. better undercooked than burned, you can always cook them longer :] GREAT muffins, this is defintely going into my make again recipe section!!!

Love these! I get 6 jumbo muffins from the batter. So far, strawberry nutella and white chocolate blueberry have been fantastic variations with this batter.
Update: try adding 1/4 C of crushed Nilla wafers into the batter with a pint of blueberries and top with more crushed nilla wafers...delicious!

The greatest thing about this recipe is the versatility.  I chose to make these into chocolate chip muffins and added a streusel topping to half of the batch.  I also did as someone previously and used 1/4 cup melted butter instead of the oil.  I plan on using this muffin recipe often for different additions of fruit, chocolate, nuts, etc.

I'm an absolute beginner in baking so I loved this recipe. I've made it 3 times now, the first 2 following the recipe word by word until I'm confident enough to alter it.   For the 3rd time, I substituted the oil with melted butter and added 1 more egg, and less sugar. The result was so fluffy, it was almost like cake!  It's great to read the comments and see the different combination. I made mine with ground flaxseed, chocolate chips and almond flakes topping. Give it a try!

I don't really like leaving bad comments, since I believe that 95% of the time, it's the cooks fault, but this was not the case. I made a few changes by reviews, using sour cream, and 1/4 cup honey with 1/2 cup of sugar, added a tsp of vanilla, and these did not work out for me. I used it as a base for my grape muffins, since the original recipe I have is lacking something, but these are even worse (I'm so sorry!) first of all these are too bland, even after I added more sugar; second they did not rise at all (they stay the same size as what you fill). My powder is brand new and I know I didn't overmix the batter; the batter was actually lovely to work with. My finished product is tasteless and completely stuck to the paper liners. I had planned on taking these to church (I was begged to) and now I can't. I'll try again someday, but not for sweet muffins.

A nice start, but needs work. Needed an extra 1/4 cup of milk, but were still dense and lacked flavour. I added 1 C granola, 1/2 cup chopped dried apricots/raisins/banana and a tablespoon of chocolate chips, plus I substituted Splenda for sugar. Next time I'd omit the chocolate chips, try some golden brown sugar, and add some vanilla. ... Lastly, the paper cups stuck to the muffins, badly -- next time I'd grease & flour the muffin tins.

these were good, not great. you definately need to add some flavoring to them or they just taste like sugary nothing. they are also very very sweet, so i'd cut back on the sugar if you want to make savory muffins. i added bananas, walnuts, cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar to make banana nut muffins. they were pretty good, but not the best muffin recipe i've used.

These muffins were pretty good.  I just found the texture to be a little too cakey for my taste.  My family loved them though!!  I added a little more than 1cup of chocolate chips.  Will try this recipe again, perhaps a different version

Wonderful recipe!  I made them up as large muffin tops.  Since these are basic muffins, you can play with the recipe.  I zested a large navel orange and got about 2 tsp. zest.  Juiced 2 large navels and got about 3/4 C juice.  Filled to 1 C level with milk.  Added 1 C Craisins tossed with 1 tsp. flour. Baked for 10 mins. at 375.  Perfect!  Loved the lightly crisp crust and soft inside.  Next time, I will use an egg wash and sprinkle with raw sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were absolutely fantastic, especially if you want a light fluffy treat instead of a heavy dense, doughy glop.  I put in 1 cup of chocolate chips and 3/4 cup of flaked coconut and they were absolute heaven!  I also made 6 big muffins instead of 12 small.  I increased the cooking time to 35 minutes and that seemed to work.  Can't wait to try raspberries and almonds!

Very good basic muffin recipe, they rose nicely and are very moist, not too sweet. I added two mashed bananas to this recipe, and thought it needed something to jazz it up, maybe some kind of spice like nutmeg or maybe part brown sugar and part white sugar.

I have made variations of these muffins over and over and my family never gets tired of them. So far their favorites are peach, strawberry and the one's I currently have in the oven... banana. I would recommend this recipe to everyone. The only thing that I add that isn't in the recipe is a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Personally, I think it adds a little something to the muffins.

I love these muffins... I have made them a few times now with chocolate chips in some and fresh blueberries in the others. I actually didn't like it as much with blueberries, but have made them again with chocolate chips. These have such good flavor that I would actually eat them plain or just with some cinnamon and sugar baked on top. They do tend to dry out just a little bit once they cool, but if you put them in the microwave for 5-10 seconds they moisten right back up (and if you have added chocolate chips then it makes them gooey again)

This is a good base recipe. Wonderful for kids to add there own ingredients to. My son & I made them into Peanut butter & jelly muffins by adding 2/3 cup melted P.B. into the batter, filled cup a third of the way added a small drop of jelly(we used grape) then add more batter filling cup about 2/3rds full. They came out really good!

These muffins were awesome!  I used a little bit less sugar and flour (bc I ran out), and did the baking powder substitution wrong and they still came out great!  I added probably more than 1 cup of defrosted strawberries that I coarsely chopped. I preheated the oven to 425 and when I put the muffins in I decreased the temp. to 400.  They took about 15 minutes to bake in my oven.

Amazing! I added some cocoa to the dry ingredients and when I added the wet I included some dark and white chocolate chips. Made 12 large muffins and baked for 25minutes at 175degrees celcius on fanbake - perfectly cooked!!

I must say I agree with all the reviews. This is a great tasting, easy to make recipe. I replaced half of the flour with whole wheat flour and oat bran to add more fiber, and added 3 ripe bananas and chopped nuts. They came out great!

These muffins are delicious! I've used this recipe at least 30 times. I love the way the berries taste with these. I've used raspberries (favorite) blueberries, chocolate chips - they always turn out perfect. I love how SIMPLE this recipe is! I have not made muffins from a box since finding this recipe, because it's so easy.

This is such a great muffin base!  It will be my go to starter for all kinds of muffins.  I tried one variation, which was excellent: instead of milk, I used light coconut milk, then added dried apricots and white chocolate chips.  I swear, it was like a vacation in a muffin!  Wonderful!!!

I have made these two times (once in my older oven and today in my brand new oven) and followed the recipe exactly:  both batches were burned on the bottom.  I would definetly check on the muffins around the 15 min. mark.

I've tried a couple basic muffin recipes from the site and this is my favorite. I just made a double batch and made two different kinds.  In one batch I put a dollop of raspberry preserves in the middle of the muffin before baking and sprinkled a few choc chips on top.  Yum.  The other half I put two mashed bananas and some cinnamon and baked it in a cake pan and just baked it a little longer.  Turned out wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe Lori!

Okay, so I used this recipe as part of my chemistry project-baking soda verses baking powder. The basic recipe has no acid in it, so it was perfect for my experiment. The only thing I did differently was split the dough in half and do 1 1/2 tsp baking soda in one, and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder in the other. My assumption was that the baking soda ones would be dense, doughy, and not puffed up. Boy, was I wrong! The soda ones turned out better-they browned more evenly, were puffier, and had a better overall flavor. If you use this recipe, I would recommend using soda instead of powder! Thanks for the recipe!

Great basic muffin recipe. Made cinnamon chip muffins that turned out great!

As a side note, 3 teaspoons = 1 Tablespoon so you really just need 1 tablespoon of baking powder, rather then measuring out 3 teaspoons.

Loving it, great mix for the basic, I made a bowl of the stuff and devided it into 3 smaller bowls and added different ingredients to it. Some with peanut butter, some with rum aroma and chocolate chips....and all came out great. 

The mix is a little light, so use two little paper cups if you make the muffins, so they will come out nicely and round.

Excellent! I used Whole wheat flour instead of white, 1/2c applesauce instead of oil, and slpenda instead of sugar and folded in 1c fresh blueberries. Definitely a keeper!  My Husband didn't even realize it was "diet " friendly!

This is a great base recipe...you can pretty much add whatever you want to the mix and then bake. I made mini muffins so my 1 year old could hold them better, this recipe made 48 of those suckers. I made one batch with one large mashed banana and another with apples and cinnamon. Both came out great. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar to keep them moist. In the apple cinnamon batch I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the mix and then threw in the diced apples.

These were okay. They were kind of tough, and the kids weren't overly thrilled by them, even with choc. chips. Hoping to find one that is a little cakier and not quite so heavy.

Oh my yummy goodness!  I used all Splenda instead of sugar and fat free vanilla yogurt instead of the oil.  I then added a teaspoon of vanilla and one of cinnamon plus 1/2 t. soda (which Splenda suggested).  When I tried the finished product I was fully prepared to shrug my shoulders and say "well,  not bad for a low fat, lo cal muffin"  but this muffin is so yummy and adaptable!!!  My husband has already requested a second batch.

I added vanilla, lots of cinnamon, chocolate chips, and used whole wheat Pastry flour instead of white - amazing.  just make sure you use pastry flour instead of regular whole wheat, or else the muffins come out dry and heavy.

I thought these turned out really good.  I made them almost fat free by substituting the oil with one mashed very ripe banana.  I also added some frozen blueberries, and used half whole wheat flour.  They tured out just great for such healthy muffins!  They rose up really nicely and had a great crust on the outside.  Mine made 9 regular sized muffins.  This will be my new muffin recipe.

Blueberries, white chocolate chips, and cinnamon make a lethal combination, so be careful!  "Absolutely the best muffin I have or will ever taste," according to my roommate.  Made them again using dried cranberries, slivered almonds, cinnamon, vanilla and almond extracts... Topped with a glaze of instant vanilla pudding mix, confectioner's sugar, cinnamon, and a few drops of water...  The reaction?  "These might actually be better than the first ones!"   Sounds good to me.  : )

I had to make 225 muffins for our church Easter Brunch and this recipe was great!!!I scaled it to 36 servings and made it with five different additions. One with MILK chocolate chips, another with raspberries and struesel topping,blueberry and pineapple with coconut extract. I made a glaze with pineapple juice and topped it with a little coconut. they tasted like little pina colada muffins. Everybody loved them!!

These are the best!!!  I have made them many times now, and I must say my kids liked it best with chocolate chips but I liked them best with orange peel and coconut added.  I also made them once with diced apples, that was very good too!  I have given this recipe to friends as they ask for it after having a muffin -- I like to have them made up and ready for my children when they come home from school -- makes a terrific snack!  They are wonderful!  I actually threw out my other muffin recipes!

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made blueberry muffins several times, making no substitutions and adding 1 cup blueberries and 2 tsp vanilla extract.   I am surprised at how much I enjoyed these muffins, since I have been disappointed with other blueberry muffin recipes on this site that use a lot more fat and sugar than this one.

The title of this recipe is so true.  I made three types (apple cinnamon, chocolate chip and blueberry) .  They were delicious.   This will be my goto recipe from now on.

Great and easy to mix up for breakfast in the morning or to go with coffee and share at work.  I mixed in coconut flakes, toasted almonds and a small handful of white chocolate chips.

This is such a great base! I tried Katie's suggestion and preheated the oven to 425 and then brought it back to 400, and it worked out really well. I used 1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup white. And I substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the vegetable oil. I made mine on the smaller size, and it yielded about 20. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these as "muffin tops" to use a fruit topping with.  AWESOME.  Just sweet enough, and soft enough for a little spoon of fruit topping.  I followed the recipe exactly, just without adding a "flavor" to it.  Very good.

This is a great starter recipe.  First time around, I added a cup of milk chocolate chips (I rolled them in a tbsp of flour before adding to wet mixture to prevent them from sinking to the bottom), but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  The next day, I added 1/4 cup of instant cappuchino with an extra tbsp of milk to the recipe (along with 1 cup chocolate chips).  They turned out great!

Fantastic muffin. My favorite variation is chocolate.  I use hot water instead of milk, mix in 1/4 cup powdered cocoa and with the wet ingredients. Add 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I actually baked mine for 20 mins instead of 25.  The kids beg for these.

This is a great and easy recipe.  Thanks, Lori.  I've modified it a bit for my family's tastes.  I add a 1/2 tsp vanilla.  For the flour, I use 1 cup unbleached + 1 cup white whole wheat.  To make the muffins light and less dense, I fold in 2 whipped egg whites.

This is an excellent muffins recipe.  I have used half whole wheat flour and it  still works well.  I have also used this recipe to make a master mix.  I times it by 7 or 8 and store the dry ingredients, then when I make muffins I use 2 3/4 cups dry mix with 1 egg, 1 cup milk and 1/4 cup oil.  I have also added banana one time and cheese and cooked bacon and those were great too.  A simple muffin recipe made even easier.. Thanks for the recipe.

good! I made these into banana/chocolate chip muffins by adding two mashed banana's and chocolate chips before putting them into the pan, the banana was a nice hint but it wasn't too obvious, so adding one or two more wouldn't hurt.

The only changes I made to this recipe is 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. A lot of the comments said that it will burn if you bake it for a full 25 mins but it did state in the directions that you should bake them for 25 mins or UNTIL GOLDEN, so I only bake it for about 15 mins, and it turned out just great. By the way, I make it with 1 cup of fresh blueberries.

I love how easy this recipe is and how much room there is to experiment. I used half white and half brown sugar, added cinnamon and nutmeg and fresh blueberries. Sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking too. Make sure to coat the blueberries in flour before you add them to the batter so that the batter doesn't turn that awful blueish green color. I also had to substitute rice milk for the regular milk due to a whey allergy but it works fine and is lower in fat. I'm looking forward to making these muffins again and trying different variations such as whole wheat flour, wheat germ, apples and walnuts, maybe carrot raisin or banana berry. Thanks for sharing..everyone can make great muffins using this recipe!

Wonderful base recipe! I'm in the process of moving and had some leftover baking supplies around so I threw the following substitutions in: 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. 1 1/2 cups white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 1/2 cup dried cherries, substituted 4oz applesauce for the oil (they are a mite bit dry, so next time maybe oil will work better), and added a mashed banana in. YUM.

This is a great versatile recipe.  I made "pink princess muffins" this morning at my daughter's request, I diced a few strawberries and a mango, tossed them in 1T of sugar and added them, along with a little Wiltons pink gel foodcoloring to the batter and topped them with pink coarse sugar.  I do agree with a few other reviews that you need to heat the oven to 425 and then lower it to 400 as soon as you put the muffins in, they only need about 20 minutes to bake and they turned out light, fluffy and delicious!

I used this as a base for sausage and cheddar muffins.  I did have to tweak it to adjust for savory, rather than sweet, muffins.  I cut the sugar to 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and used just a splash more than 1/4 cup of oil (just to make sure it stayed moist).  I used 1/2 cup of sausage and a full cup of shredded cheese.  The mix was getting a bit too dry so I cut back to 1 3/4 cups of flour.  I baked at 375 for about 18 min.  The result was moist and tasty.  The texture was also perfect for savory muffins - less cake-like and more bread-like.  Would definitely try the recipe as is for sweet muffin recipes though :)

This recipe was simple to make and very adaptable. I omitted the oil and replaced it with applesauce, and sprinkled a cinnamon/sugar mixture on top. These were so good that the dozen that I made was gone in half an hour. Next time, I will have to make double!

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! I can FINALLY make a muffin to be proud of! I added some fruit - the raspberry, blueberry and marionberry fozen berries from Costco... Oh my oh my these are sooo good. I only made 9 so they were nice and big, and took the advice of one reviewer who recommended preheating to 425 and then turning it down when you put them in. Perfect.

i tried this recipe twice.  once with chocolate chips and the second time with chedder and herbs.  i did exactly what the recipe said and they looked delicious but much to my dismay, both times they were dry!  i will have to find some way to tweek it, perhaps add more milk or oil?  I wanted so badly for them to be as tasty as they looked but they just weren't.  no one else seemd to have had this problem, what am i doing wrong???

I followed the recipe exactly and my muffins came out perfectly!!! I stole a suggestion from another review and put the temperature up to 220C before putting the batter in.  A couple of minutes after, I turned the oven down to 205C.  This helped to give the muffins a nice 'mushroom' head.

I made blueberry muffins from this recipie.  Although it wasn't quite as good as from the box or quite sweet enough for me, it was by far the best blueberry muffins I ever ever made from scratch.  I added a splash of cinnimon next time I may add nutmeg too.

These muffins turned out great. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the baking time. If I would have left them in for the full 25 minutes they would have been burnt to a crisp. I took them out at 20 and they were still a little to brown for my liking. I used soy milk and an egg substitute for my dairy/egg allergic daughter. I also added fresh strawberries since they are in season. I have been looking for a good versatile muffin recipe and have finally found one that is not sickening sweet. I am always excited to find a non-egg dominate recipe for breakfast for my daughter. I can't wait to try banana and blueberries when they are in season.

Wow thanks so much for this stupendous muffin base recipe!  I just finished whipping up a batch of green surprise Christmas muffins (I mixed some green food coloring into the egg and milk mixture).  I used half wheat half all-purpose flour, reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and used half brown half white, used mashed banana instead of oil, and dumped pecans, crushed peppermint, chopped apples, cinnamon, rolled oats, and white chocolate chips into random muffins- they came out great!

These were excellent.  I used 1/4 C Maple syrup instead of white sugar.  I put 1/2 C of chopped bacon and 1/4 C of shredded cheddar cheese.  I added another teaspoon of baking powder because I used Spelt flour instead of white flour.  I would make these again. They were very tasty.

I made exactly as written...My variation was strawberry preserves in the middle.  Nothing outstanding about the taste of the muffin..it's the fact that you make them your own by what you mix in..I will be using this recipe a lot and am anxious to try a savory variation next.. :)

Very easy and quick. Added 2 mashed bananas and chocolate chips. Could have been a little more bouncy, but still good.

Ok, I am a nerd.  Forgot to add the egg.  They were still wonderful, just a little rubbery, (but that was my fault).  I added fresh squeezed orange juice from two oranges, and the zest of one, also, I had frozen strawberries so I defrosted about 6 of them, chopped them and added them...next time I will add more.  Yummy!

It's nice! I make it into Orange Muffin. The only thing I change is replace the 1-cup-milk into 1/2 Milk + 1/2 Orange Juice, with orange zest. New time I will use brown sugar to give it a nicer browning!! Thx for the recipe

Fantastic muffin!  I can't wait to try the different varieties.  BUT I don't suggest using this with cheese.  I used shredded mild cheddar and couldn't taste the cheese.  Much better with fruit.

This is an easy recipe, but they don't stay moist long.  I added bacon and cheese and they were okay at first, but dry the next day.  Also, didn't think the sweetness of the muffin was to great with the savory additions.

They really are the best ever!  I had no idea muffins were so easy to make either.  I made strawberry jam filled muffins (just add a dollop of jam to the top of your batter after you fill the tins) and only altered the recipe by using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Definitely the best muffins I've ever had!

These we're very tasty! I'm a film maker and recently take 3 dozen of these along on a week's film shoot. I made three different types, mixed spices and walnuts, mixed berry, and mandarin oranges with rasperry jam. All were good and a huge hit on the set. I think the mixed berry were the BEST! I used frozen berries. Very easy. I also used wholemeal flour instead of white....5-stars! I am looking forward to making (and eating) these again soon!

Pull these out of the oven at the first sign of gold on top - if you get them out before they 'look' done, they'll be so much better.  As long as they bounce back when you push down on the top, they're done enough.  Mine needed about 19 minutes, I baked at 395.  Great with frozen wild blueberries and a 1/4 tsp each lemon and vanilla extracts.  Thank you Lori!

5-Star rating is not nearly enough for this recipe! It is awesome! You can add anything you want to this basic muffin recipe: nuts, fresh fruit, cinnamon, chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, coconut! I have made this recipe many times now. One time, I poured the batter into the muffin pan and then dropped a heaping teaspoon of raspberry jelly on top of each muffin, took a knife tip and swirled it once througout the batter, baked as normal and the muffins came out MARVELOUS! Today I will bake this recipe again and it will be apples and cinnamon! Bravo to the author of this recipe! THANK YOU!  Note: DO NOT OVERBAKE!

This was a super quick recipe to make!  I made blueberry muffins with frozen blueberries and the blueberries clumped somewhat a bit at the bottom of the baked muffins.  So maybe next time I will reserve 2 tablespoons of flour and dredge the blueberries in the flour before adding to the batter.  I also made a streusel topping.  They were yum yum!  Thanks for sharing!

This was the best muffin recipe I have tried so far.  I really like the versatility of it.  I tried it adding 2 cups of fresh cranberries, one chopped up apple (peel removed), cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice and one heaping tbsp of orange marmalade (melted and added to liquids before adding to dry ingredients).  I cooked tham at 400 degrees F but they were done in 20 minutes and were nice and moist and light.  I will definately make these again but am already thinking of other variations.  Thank you for this recipe.

This recepie has been a hit with my family.  Thank you for the basic format.  I have just made cheese muffins, banana muffins and apple muffins.  I made a batch with apples and substituted apple sauce for the oil and it is healthier and yummy.  Pluse we get to use all the fruit that in a couple of days would end up in the trash.

Cinnammon sugar and vanilla extract and brown sugar are nice additions.  I have tried them all and my familu loves them.  Thanks again for a super easy and fast recepy and another healthy addition to my kids lunch box.  Mini muffins need to be cooked for less time and 375.

All the reviewers are right on: this muffin recipe is the best. I replaced half the oil with applesauce and used peanut butter and chocolate chips. The texture of the muffins is super light and fluffy and has just the right amount of sweet. I realize you've read it before, but thanks Lori!

This muffin recipe was great. Not too sweet. Very moist. They taste good plain or with something added. I put in one cup of frozen mixed berries. Delish! Just some cooking tips:  3 teaspoons equals 1 tablespoon, easier to remember. And I treat the sugar as a liquid in a tea bread recipe like this. I add it into the milk/egg/oil and mix. I think you get a better texture this way.

I almost never fail a recipe and this one was pretty easy. So that's not the problem. It tasted like bread, which isn't what I expected. Plain, quite dense soft bread, with maybe a hint of sweetness. I would see that with a breakfast and jam on it or something. But on it's own it's just so plain. I made 3 : maple, raspberries and chocolate chips. All turned out this way. I think adding sugar, and + or - something to make it more light.

Just tried this with leftover delicata squash.  Added about 3/4 of a cup of squash and reduced milk to 3/4 of a cup.  Also used brown sugar instead of white.  Added cinnamon, ginger to the batter and sprinkled cinnamon-sugar on top.  Delicious right out of the oven!

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  This is a perfect base recipe.  We mix up many batches by mixing and storing the dry ingredients in quart ziplocks for a quick fix (just write the additions and baking time on the bag). Every addition anyone has thought to try has worked great.  We most often just toss frozen berries in and they work really well.

Sugar 1/2 cup.  Been baking these for 40 years.  They are always better than good.

Love this! I use it at least once or twice a week. I make minis for my toddler because she can handle them herself. We have tried all kinds of add ins and substitutions. 

My fave so far is the brown sugar almond made yesterday. I substituted brown sugar for half of the sugar in the recipe and added a cup of crushed almonds. Then, it was topped with brown sugar topping. Not very healthy, but so good!

Another add in we enjoy is whole grain oats!

Thanks for the recipe!

I did exactly like the recipe calls for and added raisins to it and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. I baked them at 400 for 20 minutes and they turned out rubbery and chewy instead of soft and moist.

A pretty good basic recipe, although the muffins turned out somehow pale and with little aroma when they were freshly out of the oven. The flavor of my choice were 1/2 cup of walnuts, 1/2 cup of diced butternut squash, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Surprisingly it wasn't too sweet. Update on savory muffins: I reduced sugar to 2 tablespoon, added 1/4 cup of pan-fried onion, 1/2 cup of chopped bacon, and 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese in the dough. Considered the amount of grease, I only added 2 tsp of bacon fat and no vegetable oil. The muffins turned out again a little bit pale and with mild dough taste. I think it would need something like parmesan cheese. It is a much better recipe for sweet muffins than savory ones.

This is a great base recipe when making your own muffins.  You can add literally anything to this to give it your own personal flair!  I made this recipe as is and the only change I would make in the future is adding a little bit more sugar.  Maybe a cup instead of 3/4 of a cup.  I will def be making these again only this time adding some chocolate chips!

This ARE the best ever muffins.
I substituted the oil for butter, but that was just it; these were the most tender muffins I have ever baked, and simple too, too many "dessert" muffin recipes out there, not enough "snack" ones, this one fits the bill with it's simplicity and versatility.
Thank you!

Simple, quick and easy! I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the egg mixture and used almond milk instead of milk (only because I didn't have any). I also added 1 cup of frozen mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries and marionberries). I followed a suggestion of preheating the oven to 425 and cutting it down to 400 when I put the muffins in and this resulted in muffins that rose beautifully. Baked for exactly 25 minutes and they were super moist, light and fluffy - almost cake-like with a crisp outer layer! This is a great base recipe.

It's very easy and fast to make.  The taste is pretty good:)  I followed the recipes as it was the first time, 25 minutes bake time was too long--a little burn on tops and got hard around muffins.  The second time I made this I reduced the bake time to 20 minutes, and it was much better!

I just made the recipe - one batch with vanilla and dark chocolate and another batch with cocoa, almond extract, chopped almonds and white chocolate. The muffins are very moist and somewhat crumbly. I prefer the vanilla/chocolate combination, but it is probably due to the low quality of the white chocolate I used - it melted into the batter and made the muffins quite oily. I am really looking forward to using this recipe with other combinations.

This is an awesome recipe! I doubled it and added apple to batter + cinnamon sugar to one half... strawberries to the second half. Both came out great.
I used half whole wheat flour and olive oil instead of veg oil. This is a great versatile recipe for whatever you might have in your kitchen. Will use it a lot.

I stuck with the basic recipe and added the juice of half a tangelo, the zest of one tangelo, a splash (about 1 tbsp) lemon juice, about 1/2 cup coarsely chopped Craisins (Ocean-Spray variety) and substituted 1/4 cup of flour for 1/4 cup enriched farina (cream of wheat, uncooked - I love the texture it gives muffins!). Baked them in lined baking cups for 20 minutes and they were perfect!  This is a great base recipe for muffins!  I'm excited to try other new combinations!  (I also found that if making mini-muffins, cut cooking time in half)

Love these!   I followed the recipe exactly the first time adding berries I picked over the summer. The second time, I made the batter with 2 T sugar & divided it. To one half I added 4 slices crumbled crisp bacon, chives, cracked black pepper & 1/3 cup cheddar. To the other half I added frozen sugar coated blueberries, more sugar & topped em with slivered praline cinnamon almonds.   The result - everyone was happy! (I got high praise and used up some extra stuff! - YAY)

Thanks for the recipe - I attempted savory style and found the taste way too sweet, I'd suggest cutting out 1/2 sugar if not doing sweet muffins. It would be a great recipe for sweet muffins.

I don't get it. Everyone said they were so good and I was super excited to make them and they were right after I baked them. They had a nice crust, soft inside, etc. Really nice. But the next day they were incredibly dry and almost cornbread-like. I was super disappointed. Oh well.

Great recipe! I followed the recipe, adding raisins and a bit of ground cinnamon. Super delicious! Will definitely be making these often. They cooked up so pretty and golden, light, crumbly texture inside. Beautiful! Thanks for sharing this gem!

This was TERRIBLE. I tried to do Peach & almond with chopped peaches & almond extract topped with slivers of almonds but it was a waste of ingredients. the batter is too wet for muffin batter. I don't know if it is just me, but if i make it again, I would definitely increase the baking time and reduce temp cz by the time the tops were getting burnt, the inside was still only semi-cooked.
Oh and the muffins stuck to the wrapper :(

A little too plain and dry for my taste, I used 1 small package of blackberries.  The blackberries were large and might have been better cut up to distribute their moistness in the cupcake better.  The batter portion was just OK, it's better heated up and smothered in butter.

I love this recipe. It's tried and true! I do however like to mix things up from time to time, and replace the oil with apple sauce or avocado, with shredded carrot or banana, or even half and half. So yummy. And a recent experiment I have just finished was replacing the milk with breastmilk!!! Tastes the same! :P My daughter loves them & my husband has no clue :P lol

Great versatile recipe to use as a base!  I added: 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 3 apricot and coconut logs, sliced, about 1/4 c. coconut, and about 1/2 c. sliced almonds.  I topped some with cinnamon sugar and some with coconut.  I substituted 1/2 the oil with applesauce, and only used about 2/3 of the sugar called for in the recipe.  They turned out FANTASTIC!!  I love this recipe, thank you!

I made these this afternoon, and thought that they were a great muffin.  I made half with blueberries and the other half with chocolate chips.  Both were fantastic.  I used 1 cup of all-purpose flour and 1 cup Ultragrain flour.  I also used 2 TBSP oil and 2 TBSP reduced fat sour cream.  Took the advice of others and set the oven temp to 425 and reduced to 400 when putting the mufffins in the oven.  Sprinkled the tops with raw cane sugar, and they looked beautiful.  Great basic recipe, will use again and again.  Next time I am going to make mini muffins for the kids snacks.

Bland! I don't know why these are quite so popular. Not particularily sweet or flavorful. I added apples, cinnamon and vanilla and they taste like bread with a hint of flavor. Very unimpressed. Needs more sugar to start.

Very delicious, although I'd suggest cutting back on the sugar just a bit... I think I'll only use 1/2 cup next time.

This did raise very nicely, but I wasn't too crazy about the flavor.  I added some pumpkin and vanilla, so I didn't add the full cup of milk.  If I make again I will use a full cup of sugar and mabye butter or chocolate chips.

These muffins were outstanding. I only used 1/2 C sugar and I replaced the egg with egg beaters original (1/4 C). i also used apple sauce instead of the vegetable oil. For the fruit, I mashed up 2 bananas and stirred into the mixture and placed chopped up strawberries on top of half of them. So yummy. Will definitely be making these often.

Great base recipe! I've just now made my first batch, and they look wonderful! I can't wait until the muffins cool off so I can try one. I made four types: strawberry jam-filled muffins, choc-chip muffins, chocolate flavoured with chocolate chips (adding cocoa powder and brown sugar) and cinnamon-brown sugar muffins.     

Edited to add: 

These are the most delicious muffins I've ever made, they are so spongey, and it's so great that you can experiment and make any flavour you want. My boyfriend says that these are the best he's ever had! I've already made these again, and plan to use this recipe again and again! Thanks for sharing this great recipe with us! 

Five stars! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Spectactular! I added a handful of shredded coconut, a splash of vanilla, 2 tbs of raspberry jam, and some lemon. The texture was perfect. I can't believe how versatile this recipe is.     I actually used 1.5c all purpose flour, and .5c self-rising flour because I ran out. They came out fluffy and nice. I'll probably keep doing that. This will be the only muffin recipe I'll ever need.

I find that after baking, the muffin is less moist, therefore tends to stick onto the paper muffin cup. Has tried twice and both results the same.   Although the taste is ok, but don't think I'll follow this recipe...... will try others instead.

Excellent Recipe! I was craving muffins but had no muffin mix in the pantry.  I used this recipe to make cinnamon apple muffins using 2 gala apples cored and peeled and then finely chopped.  I also added 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon and .5 teaspoon of nutmeg to the flour mixture.  They were a big hit and a recipe I will return to.  I look forward to using this basic recipe to make bacon cheddar cheese muffins.

This is a great base. I just got done making them. I substituted peach applesause for the oil. This is what I had on hand. It is the little single serve no sugar added applesauce. I added the whole thing. Then I went to my fridge and grabbed all the half emptied jellies and started putting them in a 1 cup measuring cup. Note: I use Polaners all fruit jelly. I don't know if this would work with the more sugary jellies. I used a mini muffin pan and baked them for 15 min. They are wonderful. I will be taking them to the baby shower I am co-hosting on Sunday. Thanks Lori!

Great muffins. Very quick and easy to make. I made a batch with shredded cheese and bacon that were great. Also made a batch with frozen blueberries that were good, but would add vanilla next time. They seem very versatile, holding on to this one.

it was good , fast and easy . the good thing about it that I can satisfy every one in my family by one recipe , I can divide the batter and mix each part with different fruits and spices according do every one . my favorite is adding 2 cups of shredded carrots + 1 cup of raisins + 1 tbs cinnamon. the next time I`ll add some coconut . I think the sugar amount is good, not too sweet or too bland.

I made these as mini muffins with 1 c. chocolate chips and cooked them for 12 1/2 minutes.  They were ok.  I wouldn't say the best ever though.  A recipe I made in home ec in middle school actually was a little better.  Guess I will just stick with that one until I find a better one.

This is an excellent easy to follow recipe. I added a tsp of vanilla per batch.  I doubled the recipe and made exactly 24 muffins. It is not too sweet which makes it easily altered either savory or more sweet. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These muffins are delicious!  The only thing I changed was adding 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to the mix.  And I had some frozen strawberries that I cut up small (1 cup full) and put in.  They turned out great and will definitely be a regular in our house!

These were very good.:) I would have liked them a tad sweeter, but otherwise, a great basic recipe. From one batch, I made blueberry, chocolate chip, and butterscotch muffins. They all went quickly! :) Will surely make again. Thank you!

I was totally skeptical of this recipe.  I couldn't believe that it was really as good as everyone was saying it was.  But I made it, and now I'm a believer.  I added frozen strawberries that I thawed out and chopped up, and then I also added a mashed banana.  Wow.  I've never had strawberry/banana muffins before, but now they're my favorite!  The changes I made to the recipe were that I used half white, half whole wheat flour, and then I used applesauce instead of oil.  I also added a teaspoon or so of vanilla.  YUM.  I'm actually eating them as I type. :)

I replaced the milk with a cup of strong brewed coffee, and added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Didn't have muffin liners, so I just sprayed the tin with Pam.  Divine!  :-)

These are really good - I added a tsp. of vanilla, some pumpkin pie spice, and I filled the cups 1/2 way with batter, dropped a tsp. of strawberry jam on top, the covered with more batter and they came out really yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

These could have passed for cake and do not have the bread-like consistency of a muffin.  The batter is too runny due to the amount of milk, and I suggest using at least one more egg.  Although the amount of sugar is right, and the flavour is okay if I wanted to make cupcakes.  I'd just add vanilla.

These are great muffins! I used this recipe to make muffins once and then again to make a blueberry muffin cake. I recommend adding blueberries & a little lemon extract, put it in your muffin tin and add a bit of cream cheese to the middle of each muffin... it's SOOO good. :) However, on the savory side of this, I just don't see how it could work unless you omit the sugar called for.

So fast and extrememly easy to make! I used up some leftover grated carrots(about 1 1/2 cups) and added a pinch of cinnamon. This is a great base recipe for any kind of muffin you like! I tried Katie's advice(on the first page in reviews)to get them to dome, but unfortunately it did not work. Still came out great though! Not five stars, only because they are not the "best ever". Did not have that bakery texture I keep looking for. They were a bit on the chewy side, even though I did not overmix at all. Thanks!

The first time I made this, I didn't do any alterations to it.  It turned out looking beautiful..however, it was abit too dry (personal opinion) and there were too much of the taste of the baking powder..i would reduce alittle salt too...what i liked about this is the side of the muffin turned out just alittle crisp while the inside was still fluffy!~
The second time I made it, I changed alittle bit of things. I used 2 cups of self-raising flour (omitting the baking powder and salt simply because I ran out of plain flour and b.p), i put 1/2 white sugar and 1/4 of brown sugar (or maybe just alittle more then 1/4), and 1 tsp of vanilla essence to the milk/egg mixture.  I also changed the milk to 1 1/2 cups instead of just 1 and at the end, I added 1 cup chopped up macadamia and 1 cup white choc chip, as well as 1/3 cups of rolled oats.  This time, it turned out not only looking beautiful, but also alittle bit more moist inside!! (p.s. the mixture might be alittle runny, so becareful when putting into muffin tin)

So easy and quick to make and turns out great! I tried whole wheat flour, but it's not as good as with regular flour, but I do substitute honey for the sugar. When making it with apples, I coat the apple pieces in cinnamon before mixing them into the batter, and sprinkle some cinnamon and powdered sugar on top of the finished muffins as well.

Super fast basic muffin mix. Start to in the oven in 5 minutes flat. Nice light texture. Added 1 1/3 cups of frozen blueberries we picked over the summer. Put them in a preheated 425 oven and reduced temp to 400 degrees. perfectly done in 25 minutes as directed. Used a 12 muffin tin without paper liners but used Wiltons Cake Release (a bakers secret weapon!).

This is a great recipe.  It is so easy and simple--I use it every Sunday for breakfast muffins and change it up each week.  I usually use half wheat flour, and add some flax or wheat germ as well.  I also really like using 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar instead of all white.  They taste great--a really flexible yummy recipe.

These muffins are fantastic and really easy to make! I usually substitute 1 cup of wheat flour for all purpose and no one even notices. I usually make these with a cup of blueberries, but have also tried them with 1/2 cup almonds and 1/2 cup craisins. If you try them with craisins I would add a little extra water to the batter as my muffins came out drier than normal.

Although these muffins were good, they made a mess in the oven. I made 12 as per the recipe and they ran out of the pans and all over the bottom of the stove. They were an ugly shape also due to the spillage. I added apple chunks and cinnamon to them. They tasted fine but what a mess. I will try them again and use part of another tin to finish using the batter up.

This recipe is great!  I added 1 cup of blueberries, 1/2 of a banana (mashed) and some cinnamon.  I also substituted 1 cup of all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour and vanilla soy milk for the 1 cup milk.  The vanilla gives them a little more flavor and with that small of an amount of wheat flour, they are still sweet and tasty.  I also substituted apple sauce for the vegetable oil, which didn't work as I had planned.  The muffins stuck to the liners a little bit.  Maybe next time I will do what another person did and only sub half of the oil for apple sauce.  Other than that problem, they are really tasty!

I like the versatility of this recipe, adding ingredients to suit one's personal taste.  The only change I made to the base recipe was to replace half the amount of oil with unsweetened applesauce.  Other than that, the peach-ginger muffins I made came out fabulous.  Thanks!

Made this recipe and at the end divided it in half.  Added fresh blueberries to  one half and finely grated carrot to the other.  Made mini-muffins for our toddlers with half of each flavor (baked for 10 minutes)and made 6 regular muffins with the rest.  Both flavors came out awesome!

EXTREMELY useful recipe. This muffin can truly take whatever you throw at it.  My first attempt involved shredded pears, raisins, toasted walnuts, vanilla and almond extract - delicious. But the muffins weren't the most attractive things I'd ever baked; they looked pale, lifeless.

Part way through making another batch (cheddar, parmesan, chives, onion salt, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and vanilla extract), I realized I was out of vegetable oil. In a panic, I used some melted down Crisco and butter (I'm *really* new at this whole baking thing), and crossed my fingers. The muffins came out delicious AND looked beautiful. They almost looked like cornbread muffins - they had that golden glow to them.

I'd give this recipe-as-is 4 1/2 stars (losing half a star for aesthetics), but since that's not possible, I'll bump it up to the full 5, because it deserves more than 4 and is SO versatile and adaptable.

This recipe worked out well for me.  I added 1 cup of cheese and it was good, although seemed a little off to have a slightly sweet, but cheesy muffin.  Was good, would maybe add something savory to it next time as well though for cheese (ie. maybe onion powder or something).  I can see it being very good with blueberries or something.

This is a wonderful fool-proof recipe which I enjoy making with my children.  My daughter have been making muffins with me using this recipe since she was 3 years old and now my son, who's 2 has joined in the muffin making.  I have shared with many of my friends this recipe and have gotten very positive feedback.  Works well with apples and cinnamon, bananas, raisins, cheese...

This is an excellent muffin base! Because my family is very heatlh consious I made a couple subsitutions - Replaced 1/2 cup sugar with Splenda, and the last 1/4 used brown.  I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and applesauce instead of the oil. 

I added 2 bananas, some dark rum, slivered almonds, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice and strawberry jam in the middle and they were very tasty with the perfect texture.  The only problem was that since I took the oil out, the muffins stuck to the papers, so next time I will just spray the pan.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a good basic muffin recipe.  I made it with a heaping cup of frozen blueberries (had some leftovers from some other muffin recipe I made a little while ago, I didn't like them that much) but this recipe seemed so easy and I happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  It took 5 minutes to put together and then the baking time.  The muffins came out moist, and fluffy and just perfect!

Outstanding!  I cut the salt in half, added a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla, used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar...a dash of cinammon with cut up strawberries and pecans...topped with a sprinkle of cinnamon/sugar...DELICIOUS!!! Great base recipe!  Definately a keeper.

Addicting...wow!

This recipe was great. I used to work in a bakery and this is very close to the recipe we used there. I used Blackberries and Strawberries with a crumb topping. Amazing!!! Even my 2 year old ate them. The only change I made was that I only baked them for 20 minutes. I think it might be because I'm at a higher elevation.Anyhow...I think everyone should try this recipe. Yum Yum!!!

Absolutely delicious! I added chopped up strawberries and sprinkled a cinnamon/sugar mix on the top to make it crunchy and sweet- everybody loved them and they were very easy to make.
Thank you. I will be trying them again with many different variations.

This is such a wonderful basic muffin recipe... the muffins have turned out nice and fluffy regardless of the added ingredients I've tried, which has included fresh blueberries, fresh raspberries and almonds, and chocolate chips.  My only issue is that they are nowhere near as good when they're day-old, so if you want to serve them at their best, make them the same day.  I haven't tried freezing them yet so I'll give that a whirl next if I want to make them ahead of time.

I used this recipe as a base, subbing 1/2 cup flour with instant oats and adding 4 spice and walnuts. Made a batch of 12 delicious "fall" muffins. The house smelled so good while they were baking! Will definitely use this recipe again!

I made these with blueberries, and they came out sweet, moist, and fluffy.  I ate two right out of the oven, and my three year old loved them too.  The only thing I added was a sprinkling of brown sugar and cinnamon on top.  One caution, though: I used an oven thermometer to make sure the temperature was right, and they still took less than twenty minutes to bake.  Keep on eye on them, or they'll burn.

I am so pleased! Has taken me many years of baking to find a muffin/bread recipe which does nto come out dense! I have actually had this recipe in my box for a longtime, but mis-catorgarized it so I forgot I had it for years in my box! I made blueberry banana muffins. I ommited the salt as I always do in baked goods as I have discovered over my many years of baking salt adds nothing to baked goods. I also do not use dairy in baking and instead use Energy egg replacer & soy milk and it works exactly the same. Since white (refined) sugar is so horrible for the body and is fined through animal bones (YUK!) I always use turbinado in place of white sugar and/or raw cane sugar. Tatses no different and is much much better all around.

These muffins are fabulous! I made sure to not overmix the batter and I added vanilla to it. I added defrosted blueberries to the mix that were lightly coated with flour to make sure the muffins wouldn't get soggy. I will be making these often.

FANTASTIC, light and lovely muffins. I just tried the recipe, using 1 cup frozen blueberries and also reducing the milk to 1/2 cup and adding 1/2 cup whole Greek yogurt...they are wonderful!!!  I also used one of the new silicone muffin pans, for jumbo muffins which made 6), now I'm throwing out all my old metal pans!

I have never made muffins before.  My husband took one bite and said these are the best muffins he's ever had.  I thought he was joking or just being nice.  But he was serious!  I took someone else's recommendation and added about 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 cup blueberries and 1 cup white chocolate chips.

This recipe is great!!! I doubled it, and added 3 small Cortland apples and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe. I think it needed more cinnamon, but otherwise was great! This will stay in my recipe box for sure. Thanks!

This very simple recipe turned out to be surprisingly delicious.  I mixed apples and cinnamon into half of the batter, and the other half I made savory with semi-sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil and rosemary.  Both versions turned out really well.

Texture is great and preparation time short.  Next time I make the savory muffins - with cheese or bacon, or both - I will reduce the amount of sugar, perhaps to 1/3 cup.  Now I'm going to try with the Korean raspberries.

Very, very good muffins. Nice and moist, not too sweet. I added 1 cup of canned diced peaches (drained) to mine. I might drizzle a little butter and brown sugar on the top next time but I will make these again and again. Can't wait to try different add ins.

I also have a recipe "Best Ever Muffins" that my aunt passed on to me.  However, it has 1 3/4 c flour, 1/4 c sugar, 2 1/2 t b.powder, 3/4 c milk, 1/3 c oil, the egg and salt. It is the best basic muffin recipe I have ever tried.  It makes a very rich, dense muffin. I just add more sugar for a sweet muffin and have had no problem when adding fruits or savory items.  Just don't add too much. Enjoy!

The best basic muffin recipe I have tried yet.  You can add anything you want to these or just eat them plain.  Very moist and easy to make. I like to add a little cinniman/sugar mixture on top before baking.  A great breakfast or snack.

These muffins were very good.  I used skim milk and applesauce in place of the oil to make them a little healthier.  I'm glad I found this recipe.

I have a daughter who has severe dairy and egg allergies.  I have tried multiple recipes with poor results.  This one was excellent!  My husband and other daughter even loved them.  I substituted egg replacer for the egg, used soy milk for the milk and added one and a half cups of frozen blueberries.  They turned out perfect.  My daughter and I thank you for a great recipe!

These muffins were O.K.  Not the best ever.  I might try them again after I've tried some other recipes first.

This is so wonderful and easy.  My first batch was cranberry-pecan (Craisins, actually).  Turned out perfect, even in those cheap tin muffin pans from the grocery.  I'll be investing in a real pan because this is so fun to think of all the combinations!!  Thank you Lori!

I eliminated the sugar completely and added applesauce, raisens and nuts to make a very "legal" muffin for diabetics.  They loved them.

Thank You Lori
This is now our favourite muffin recipe.
Do try adding three quarters cupful of frozen raspberries or blackcurrants, plus three quarters cupful of chopped Nestle white chocolate.  The resulting two contrasting flavours just have to be experienced.  If choc melts, try slightly lower temp next time, to retain as bits, if preferred.

This is a great recipe. Because everyone at our house likes different kinds of muffins, I stirred in different items after putting the batter in the muffin tins.  This worked out great, we had a batch of peach-pecan, peanut butter chips and chocolate chips!

These muffins received a warm reception.  I made one batch with cinnamon added and then I added 6 oz. of chocolate chips to another batch.  I also dipped them in melted butter and then a cinnamon and sugar mixture.

2 stars for the ease of putting together. I used fresh blueberries and mine came out dry and sort of rubbery. They're edible but I won't be making these again.

I've tried many muffin recipes and this one has been the best and the fastest! I've used strawberries, blue berries, chocolate chips and banana. All of them came out great. I also used with some, half whole wheat flour and I always add vanilla. Fantastic quick recipe!

I have made these 3 times according to the directions (no changes)  and although the taste was good, they were somewhat dry.  What can I do to correct that problem?

Great basic recipe! I did find, for whatever reason, the dough was a bit too biscuit-y when I had it all mixed, so I added about a 1/4 cup of applesauce. To add to them, I did half the batch with chopped strawberries and sprinkled sugar on top. The other half I chopped up some macintosh apple and sprinkled cinnamon sugar. They browned beautifully and are Soooooo fluffy inside.

I would say that this recipe was pretty good. I made it exactly according to the directions-no alterations! They are a mild sweet, which is fantastic. The only problem I had was that I mixed it in a plastic bowl and some of my dries got stuck at the bottom so I had to stir a bit more than I wanted to.  I was worried that because of that they would've been dense, but they actually weren't! I baked them in a cupcake pan with no liners, just cooking spray. They were done with about 20 minutes. I would recommend setting the timer for 20 min and then testing them for done ness. Then add extra baking time 1-2 min at a time, as needed. And to top some of my muffins off, I sprinkled chocolate chips! Yummy! But in all honesty they are fantastic plain with no toppings, inserts, extracts, etc. Thanks for the easy muffins!

Very good basic recipe!  I used these for mini-muffins, and baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes. I split the batter into thirds, with mini-chocolate chips in one batch, frozen blueberries with a dash of cinnamon in the 2nd batch, and lemon juice, vanilla, lemon zest and poppy seeds in the 3rd batch.  All of them were a hit at our church's brunch!

The cook time is all wrong. They were ready in about 10 minutes, very happy I decided to check them. They came out very gummy and extremely bland....even though I added apples and cinnamon to them...couldn't taste either! I would not rec. this recipe.

I just made these and loved the simplicity.  I followed the recipe exactly and to half added frozen blueberries and half chocolate chips.  I have only tried the blueberry ones and they taste wonderful.  I did bake them at 375 degrees (my oven cooks fast...this time didn't use convection) and they were done in 15 mins.  The tops really rose higher than my usual muffins (thought that would be the opposite w/o convection...but this was a first for me turning off convection!).  Could be the 3tsp of baking powder.  Either way this is a keeper.

Tried many different basic muffin recipes over the years - my favorite so far! I used canola instead if vegetable oil because that's what I had. Used blueberries, chocolate chips, coconut, and walnuts. Also added cinnamon. Awesome! Endless variations to try!

I like the fact that this recipe can be used to make either savory or sweet muffins. Just cut down the sugar to 2 tbsp and add 1/2 salt.Add your favorite chopped veggies, bacon, and loads of cheese. I've made blueberry muffins for the sweet ones. They were yummy. Will make them again and again with different variations. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Um...okay, these are alright. Definitely not the best muffin in the world, but they are easy to adapt into a really good muffin. The issue I have with the recipe is the cooking time though...25 minutes...you have to be joking! If I let them cook for 25 minutes they would have been burnt to a crisp. My oven cooks at a consistent temperature and I use it daily, so I know it isn't off. 12 muffins at 400F for 13 minutes and they were golden brown. Thankfully I checked them and didn't just follow the timer on the stove!!!!

I have been looking for the perfect basic muffin recipe for a long time. I have tried TONS of recipes, only to find something wrong with every one of them. This one is the best. You can add ANYTHING to it!! I found it on Jan. 26th and I can tell you, I must've made them almost every weekend since then. I usually make blueberry(using frozen blueberries), or choc chip.The one thing I changed was, I add 2 tsp of vanilla flavoring. It makes a difference! Also, when making the blueberry muffins, I take about 15 blueberries aside and microwave them for about 40 seconds, mash them with a fork really well, and add to the mix. Brings out the blueberry flavor so much more. I think you could make any variety of muffin with this recipe. This will be my mainstay from now on.  I can't see how anyone can not like these. Oh, I also start checking them at 20 minutes, to make sure they don't burn.

This is the recipe that I always use for muffins and I am baking twice a week for the last month. I make different muffins every time, but our favorites so far are the ones with lemon peel and chia seeds (no milk used only water as I am lactose intolerant) or with orange peel and orange juice and craisins. Excellent recipe to get you started.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe, to me they weren't sweet enough. I wanted a plain muffin to make strawberry short cakes with. It might be better with fruit added. I will not be making this again.

I'm giving this 3 out of 5 stars because the baking time seemed way too long.  I only cooked these for 20 minutes and they were still too dark.  I should have started checking them at the 15 minute mark.  Other than that the flavor was good.  I usually make a muffin recipe that calls for buttermilk but I don't like having to buy a special ingredient just for muffins so thought I would give this one a try.  I made 1/2 of the batch plain, then topped with melted butter, cinnamon and sugar.  The other 1/2 I added chocolate chips to the batter.  I will make again but adjust the time and/or temperature.

Such a GREAT "last-minute" recipe!  I added 1 apple shredded, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon and a good pinch of brown sugar.  I also topped them with melted butter, old fashioned oats and brown sugar mixed together.  SO GOOD!

I have been baking for over 25 years and tried at least 30 muffin receipes.  This recipe is the best base recipe I have ever used.  The only thing I changed was adding one teaspoon of vanilla and the trick one of the other reviewers had of preheating the oven to 425 and then as soon as you put the muffins in reducing to 400.  I only need to bake mine for about 18 mins and they were tender and popped out of the pan just perfect.

This recipe is AWESOME! Simple and easy! I used it to make mini chocolate chip muffins for my kids. They LOVED them! So I have made them several times. I even tried it with bananas and walnuts. GOODBYE to prepackaged mini muffins and muffin mix!! This is WAY more ECONOMICAL!
If you do mini muffins, bake for 10 minutes. I also tried it with substituting stevia for the sugar.

Fantastic muffin recipe that acts as the perfect base for all sorts of flavor combinations. I made a double batch (which made ten massive, over-sized muffins). I divided the batter and added strawberry and rhubarb chunks to one third, sharp cheddar and apple sauce to another, and blueberries, almonds and cinnamon to the third. Cooking time definitely varies depending on how much stuff you've added (denser batter). Keep a close eye on these muffins and you'll be totally rewarded! Thanks for sharing!

This is a very easy recipe and turns out great. I like it just as it is.  I tried a sugar free version for a friend and that works well also. They do need to be baked in silicone if splenda is used, or they will stick.

I've made these several times now in many different flavors (strawberry, blueberry, green tea, chocolate chip). Everytime they are fantastic! This is by far the easiest and most versatile muffin recipe.

These are really good.  Mine had a nice crunch on top and the centers were really moist.  I added some frozen berries to half and the remainder I put a teaspoon of peach and fig preserves in the middle.  Yummy!

Just made these...AWESOME!  We added 3/4 c chocolate chips to the batter and once poured in muffin pan cups we topped with a few additional chips.  Will definitely try with other ingredients.  Thanks for a great base recipe...this makes 12 muffins on the nose!

I followed the recipe exactly using whole wheat flour and soymilk. These came out perfect! I have to bring something to a potluck tonight and I was scurrying around my tiny kitchen trying to come up with something and I happened to have all of the ingredients for these muffins. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and one diced granny smith apple. Voila! Perfect consistency, not too greasy/mushy like some muffins can be. I will definitely be coming back to this recipe in the future. So many possibilities!

I only got one bite of one muffin!  A dozen muffins disappeared in the time it took me to set them on the breakfast table, walk to the kitchen and return. Apparently, they were delicious.  I used a duo of frozen raspberries and strawberries.  From experience I knew these berries to be super tart so I tossed them in some sugar right before I added to the batter.

I made matcha muffins with this recipe as the base. Just add about 1/8 tsp of matcha to the dry ingredients. Next time I'll add more matcha because I like a stronger matcha taste.

Delicious! I just made them now, but added 1 large banana (all I had). I forgot to chop up strawberries and add them into the mix as well (my original plan) so I just smeared homemade strawberry butter over them and it was simply divine :)

Muffins were great!  I changed a few things to make them healthier: used 1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup white (instead of 2 cups white); reduced sugar to 1/2 cup; used 3/4 cup milk and 1/2 cup apple sauce (instead of 1 cup milk and 1/4 cup oil); added 1 cup blueberries; and sprinkled oatmeal on the tops prior to baking.  They turned out well, although next time I'd add another tablespoon of sugar.

I suck at baking, but these turned out perfectly! Was surprised that the batter was as thick as it was - I wasn't really expecting that. But they turned out just fine - had 12 beautiful golden muffins!  I added a half-pint of red currants to mine. They were part of my CSA and I wasn't sure how to use them...voila! Currant Muffins!  Thanks!

SO GOOD. I somehow forgot to add the salt, because I am a derp. But they're still really awesome. Perfect for my roommates and I as poor college students who can really only afford Top Ramen and the basics for baking.

Made this morning with both blueberries and strawberries.  Was tempted to use applesauce in place of the oil, but with only 1/4 cup in question, went with the oil as it seems to make a more tender cake/muffin.  Was afraid it would not be enough sugar for the blueberries, as they were not real sweet, but it was perfect even for them.  Added about 1/2 tsp or more cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the dry ingredients.  As suggested by Katie, started out at 425 and turned immediately down to 400.  Rose to great heights! Thanks for sharing!

This is now my standard recipe for muffins.  I make banana nut and apple cinnamon all the time.  The last time I made the banana nut, I used 1/2 regular sugar & 1/2 brown sugar and some vanilla.  Added the little extra punch in flavor.

Just made these tonight.  Used whole-wheat pastry flour in place of the white flour (we don't use white flour, whole wheat pastry is excellent for breads and muffins etc).  Added in 1/4 cup unsweetened applsauce, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 2 finely chopped apples that I softened in a pan with a little butter, cinnamon and dried cranberries.  Bake time was approx. 19 minutes.  They turned out fantastic.  Not overly sweet, depending on your add-ins.  This is a great base recipe to work with and make your own creations depending on your family's tastes.

Did it twice with a variation with bannana and chocolate. This was the first time baking muffins with my 8yr old daughter. She was amazed with the results and had a great time.

I made these by the recipe and they did come out quite dense as someone else had mentioned also.  I remedied this by only adding 2tsp of baking powder and adding in 1tsp of baking soda.  The next batch (and all that I've made since) have expanded and tasted more 'muffin' like!  Excellent starter recipe to add almost anything into-banana, blueberry, PB&J, cinnamon and sugar, brown sugar and maple, cinnamon and apple, frozen berries-you name it and it works!  Just make that one change by adding in the baking soda and it was perfect for us!  Thanks again!

Great basic recipe, I made carrot cake muffins with 1 cup grated carrots, 1 cup raisins, cinnamon, and little sugar on top.  Could make it more of a dessert muffin with cream cheese icing.

I have been using this as a base for all kinds of muffins and it always turns out great.  We've added all kinds of fruit, fresh and dried, garlic and herbs for pasta night, even M&Ms - blueberry banana is our favorite.  I follow the recipe exactly, still need a little more flour, and I only get 9 muffins, but they're the size we like and always tasty.

I made these last week adding just a little strawberry preserves. The turned out great. I made them again today adding cherry pie filing.  I took as much of the "juice" as I could get and mixed into the batter. I filled the cups and then added the actually cherries in the middle. I pushed the cherries down as much as possible and topped off with extra batter as needed. I followed the suggestion of preheating to 425 then turning it down to 400--loved the dome on the muffins.

I needed an easy recipes for muffins and this was definitely easy. I used 1.5 tsp vanilla, sour milk instead of regular, 1/2 wheat flour.  Something was missing.  I put a little batter in the muffin cup, sprinkled w/brown sugar and cinnamon, then topped w/more batter. Plus, I always top my muffins or quick breads w/cinnamon sugar mix to give it a little crunch.  I will make again, but it definitely needs something to give it some zing.

Great recipe! I followed another reviewers advice to preheat the oven to 425 and lower to 400 once I put the muffins in. I have never had such great tops on muffins before. I added 1 banana to the whole batch and mini chocolate chips to half the batch. I will definitely make these again.

5-star for this super-easy recipe, 5-star for its taste and 5-star for the easy-to-understand recipe instruction! I followed recipe to T. but added 1 cup of chopped fresh strawberries into batter and I got 14 beautiful "Strawberry Muffins" last night (photo will be uploaded later), all in 25 minutes as stated in recipe. Cleaning was wonderfully easy as there wasn't much bowls and utensils to wash and I will try to make "Chocolate Chips Muffin" with this recipe tomorrow. I have also received raves from co-workers as well! Thanks so much, Lori for sharing this wonderful yet versatile recipe!!

This is a GREAT muffin recipe.  Only change is that I only needed to back them for around 17 minutes.   The first time I made them I folded in a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon at the end - snickerdoodle muffins!  The second time I folded in a mixture of brown sugar and chocolate chunks.  Both times, I topped with a simple powdered sugar/buttermilk glaze.  Delicious!

400 degrees is way too hot.  Mine burned in less than 20 minutes.  But I could tell that they tasted good underneath the char.

hmm, I'm a bit stumped as to why there are so many 5 star ratings.  I was disappointed with these even though I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I had added was my own homemade preserves in the middle of the muffin. Coming out of the oven, they looked like they baked up okay but then they totally stuck to the muffin liners and just didn't have a great taste; quite bland actually.  I was so looking forward to a great muffin this morning with my homemade preserves but this is definitely not it.  Sorry for the not-so-great rating but this seemed like a waste of ingredients in my opinion.

This recipe is a terrific jumping off point.  I have made exactly as written; I have used WW flour; I have added blueberries, chocolate chips and even mashed pears and they always bake up perfectly.  They truly are the best ever!

These tasted delicious! I had some trouble keeping them from falling apart, but I think that's because of my modifications, so it still gets a 5. I used whole wheat flour and a little less oil. I lightly sauteed some chopped up apples with cinnamon, sugar, and butter and added that for half, and put a spoonful of strawberry jam in the other half. The apple ones were great but I don't think I'd make the strawberry jam ones again. Thanks for a very versatile recipe, and thanks to the reviewers for giving me filling ideas!

These were great!  I made a double batch of mix and then did three things with it.  First I filled full size muffin tins 1/3 full with batter, then added jelly, then the rest of the batter.  Those came out soupy in the middle but still tasted great.  Next time I will swirl the jelly in the batter first.  Then I added 1t of cinnamon to the mix and filled 24 mini-muffin tins.  I put cinnamon sugar on top.  Those came out good, but a little crunchy on top.  Next time I will put the cinnamon sugar on after they bake.  Then, I poured the rest of the batter in a 8" round cake pan and threw some blueberries in it.  It came out perfect.    I changed the recipe a little based on other reviews.  I added 1t vanilla to the batter and I used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil.  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  Next time I may try splenda instead of sugar to make them more healthy and up the amount of whole wheat flour.    Overall, this is a great recipe that was super versatile and easy.  I will definitely be making it again.

i made this as a savory muffin.  the texture was very nice, however, it was a little on the bland side for us. i used cheddar cheese and jalapenos. i cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup; not sure if that is what the problem was.  i will use this recipe again though for some sweet ones, and perhaps try it again for the savory.  thanks

So easy to make and the ingredients I can easily find in my kitchen.  I gree that it is a good base muffin recipe.  Added chocolate chips in the batter and it tasted yummy.

This is a great versatile recipe to have on hand.  They would be very plain and bland as written, but are meant as a base recipe for you to be creative with.  I made the batter and added blueberries (tossed in flour to prevent sinking) to 1/3 of the batch, and lemon zest and poppy seeds to the other 1/3 and strawberry jam in the middle of the other 1/3 to feed a crowd with differing tastes. People thought I spent hours in the kitchen whipping up different varieties of muffins... and it only took about 20 min to whip up all the batches. (fooled them!)  I may try using melted butter next time in place of the oil to give these muffins a richer taste.  Will also add some vanilla, almond or maple extract to add some flavor.   Overall great recipe that bakes up well, but just requires some creativity to personalize- have fun!

This is a great, basic recipe with so much room to substitute and add to, as desired.  I used about half wheat flour and apple sauce instead of oil.  I then made a batch with a cup of coconut, a cup of crushed pineapple and a maraschino cherry cut into four to make a pina colada muffin... it was great!  The batch of blueberry muffins were awesome, too.  Thanks for such a great base recipe!

My husband told me they are so good, he loves them.  That's unusual because he's very picky.  I only changed one thing: added 1/2 cup fat free milk and 3/4 cups applesauce to replace the oil.  Also, threw in a little flax meal for a health boost.  They're really yummy with fresh bluberries and not too sweet.

Great recipe! I will never buy boxed muffin mix again. I added 1/4 cup sourcream, 3/4 cup mashed bananas, 1/3 cup oatmeal, 1/3 cup chopped walnuts, and vanilla with a pinch of spice. Came out moist and yummy. Can't wait to try many other varieties. And hint try to avoid a dark coated pan if able.

I made these muffins with fresh blueberries, and they were absolutely TO DIE FOR.  The only other adjustment I made was to sprinkle cinnamon and sugar over the top of the muffins before baking, to give them that little crust my kids like, but other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter.  They were absolutely fabulous.

Good basic muffin recipe. Floowed the advice of other reviewers and preheated the oven to 425, then lowered to 400 when I put the batter in. I added two mooshed bananas and 1 tsp of rum extract. Turned out fluffy if slightly bland and not as moist as I like my muffins.

These muffins are delicious!  I added chocolate chips, about a tsp. of vanilla sugar, and a teeny bit more sugar (after reading some of the reviews).  Can't wait to try them with blueberries.  Thanks for posting.

This is a really nice muffin recipe.  Even with a little extra beating of the batter (I can't stand lumps), it came out fluffy and moist and not at all tough.  I filled my muffins with a mix of (prepared from a box) lemon custard and homemade berry sauce.  They're delicious.  I used 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg (had to use 2 yolks for the custard, so it worked out perfectly) and added about a teaspoon of vanilla, just for the heck of it.  Great base for all types of cupcakes.

This is a great muffin base. I made over 100 of these for one of my college classes today. I made double batches of banana & cinnamon, strawberry (these turned out really mushy and barely sweet, yuck! I'd reccomend drying the cut up strawberries on a baking sheet in a warm oven for a couple of hours before adding to the batter and raising the amount of sugar to a whole cup, THEN they would rock!) blueberry and chocolate chip. They were loved by all (with the exception of the strawberry, I'll have to try my suggestion and post the results). I'll put this on the frige for emergency baked goods situations! I love that you can add just about anything to this batter and it's still good!

These had a great flavor & were an excellent way to make a variety of different types of muffins, but they came out a bit hard & not very moist.  I'll definitely make them again, but they just aren't as crumbly as muffins should be.

Made them with cherries and they were super deelish! Works good with caramel too, get the caramel sweets found in stores! (Had my sis bring them back from US) Great for kids. Cherries are the best in my opinion. Thanks for this versatile and wonderful recipe! Definitely will be making more of this. Even my mum loves them and keeps pushing me to make more!

Too cakey for me.  I think I like a bit more fiber going on in my muffins - texturally and taste-wise.  

If you're a boxed muffin fan, you'll probably dig these.

These muffins were great. I made them completely plain and slathered them with homemade strawberry jam before eating... Mmm Mmm! The batter alone was so tasty I licked the bowl clean :) I will try different add-ins next time I make them. Thank you for a great recipe!

Really simple with great taste. I was able to make with a 2 year old helping. I made 6 "naked" ones and we both loved them. The others I added coconut and brown sugar to. I started the oven at 425 then lowered to 400, and baked about 20 minutes.

Extremely versatile, extremely delicious.  I made coconut cinnamon muffins and pineapple muffins.  They were delightful.  

I doubled the eggs and added a touch more oil, but not much.  I used miniature muffin tins and baked for ten minutes at 350F.

Wonderful recipe!  I agree with another review that it's too much sugar IF you're making a savory muffin.  I put bacon bits & cheese in mine, baked them in a mini muffin tin but had to bake them for 20 minutes.  My leftover batter was baked in a cast iron pan that makes triangular shaped pieces.

Good texture and a fantastic base for any kind of muffin you can imagine.  I spilt the batter into 2 and made 6 chocolate chip and 6 jam filled muffins.  Great versatility.  Thanks for submitting this, it's definitely a keeper.

I'm not too sure about this one. I followed the recipe to a T and added 2 peaches since they are in season. I think it tasted similar to cornbread. My two year old wouldn't even have anything to do with them. =/

Great recipe! I doubled the recipe and added 2 cups mashed bananas and 2 cups raisins... in addition to a dash of cinnamon! :) They turned out fantastic. I think the bananas added a bit of a fresh, sweet taste.

Truly a great muffin recipe.  Sort of cakey but not too heavy.  We always make it with berries of some sort and they always come out wonderful.  I love the fact that it is easy and requires primarily pantry items.

I used blueberries in these and they were good. I did add 1tsp. cinnamon but think though that they weren't quite sweet enough. So maybe next time I will add a tad bit more sugar and see what happens. I have some strawberries I want to use so that what I will do next.

This aren't the best ever muffins. Day one they were good, but not fabulous. I put raspberries, strawberries and blackberries in them. By day two they were too dense. I know berries make them more moist but this was sad. Over all I'm giving this one a 3. They rose up ok and looked ok, but my rating is just for taste.

Loved this recipe.  I've been searching for one that wasn't overly sweet - I don't like Costco muffins, for example - and this was perfect! 

I made some changes, but I'm sure they'd be just as good per the recipe:
- Sugar - I did 1/2 white, 1/2 brown
- Milk - 3/4 cup, and 1/4 cup applesauce (for some apple flavor since I didn't have apples)
- Added some cinnamon and nutmeg
- Added about 3/4 cup frozen blueberries
- sprinkled an oatmeal/brown sugar mixture on top before baking
- Baked for 19 minutes at 350 degrees

They turned out delicious AND pretty!

Great basic recipe!  I added 1/4 cup wheat germ to about cup or so of the mix and no one had a clue!  Try using only 1/2 the flour and substitute corn meal for the other half.  Great!

I'm giving these five stars because of how easy they are because you can personalize them to your families tastes.  I have been making these for several years.  My kids like chocolate & peanut butter chips in half and banana & pecans in the other half.  I have also made these with chocolate chips, peanut butter and honey (also a big hit).

These are really yummy- a good basic muffin recipe. I gave four stars because it is very basic, kind of bland on its own- you need to do something with it in order to make it into something exciting and I left these plain.  I am going to ice these for my son;s school party and I think this was the perfect recipe for that.

Here's my problem with these muffins: they are very, very mediocre.  I am not going to say they are inedible, but need major doctoring, and really you might as well seek out individual recipes that are "wow".  I tried these three times, hoping they would serve me, but really in the end they are too plain, and dry the next day.  1st time I added cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. and swirled brown sugar mixture in the middle.  Eh. Second time I added a 1/4 applesauce and chocolate chips.  My kids ate them warm (well, my 2 yr. old picked out the chips), but the next day they were dry.  Not worth it, I am going to move on to another muffin recipe.  Sorry.

It was quick and easy!  I added 1 cup of frozen mixed berries, so I baked for 25-30 minutes at 325F.  It doesn't require any special ingredients and very quick! What a time saver!  Thank you very much.

When I first tried this recipe I made it with blueberries tossed with a little corn starch, to keep them from falling to the bottom, lemon zest and vanilla. I also sprinkled a little sugar on top. They were good.  I was going to give this recipe a three star rating but I decided to try something else.
I made apple cinnamon.  I added a tsp of vanilla and about a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter.  I grated one small tart apple then diced another 1 1/2 apples.  I tossed the diced apples with brown sugar as suggested by someone here and sprinkled the tops with a cinnamon sugar.  I made a mistake this time and baked them at 350 for the first 25 minutes then remembered they should be at 400.  I upped the heat until the tops browned.  They were perfect and moist.  I can't keep my family out of them!  
Thanks for the recipe. Can't wait to find more interesting combos.

I substituted applesauce for the whole amount of oil, used egg substitute for the egg, and powdered milk for the milk (that one I only did because I realized we had no more milk). I also used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar just because I wanted to know what that tasted like. I added 1/2 c of semisweet chocolate chips and made about 15 muffins total. They were so good- and I have to say I was surprised because I pretty drastically changed the recipe. They were even better the next day warmed up in the microwave which is something that can't be said of most muffin recipes. I'm going to make these again and I'll try other variations. I think chopped apple and oatmeal sounds good! :)

I decided to be really different and try something new.  I made these and for the add ins I used Sauteed Vidalia onion, snipped chives and about 1 cup of shredded 2 year old cheddar cheese.  I made 4 HUGE muffins and they were delectable! Before baking them, I sprinkled the tops with roasted Garlic powder.  Next time I think I will decrease the sugar a bit though.

this makes the prettiest muffins. and they taste great.  I used strawberries and bananas.
10/24/08
I made these and used the pulp left over after juicing some apple and carrots and added some cinnamon. Me and the kids enjoyed them and it was a good way to use the pulp left from juicing.

These turned out rather nicely. Crispy tops, tender and moist inide. I'd planned on blueberry muffins but discovered my blueberries were dry and shriveled looking, so I abandoned that and looked in my pantry for ideas and I found some poppy seeds. I added 1 tsp dried grated lemon peel, 1 tsp lemon extract, and about 2 T of poppy seeds. I added the zest and the seeds to the dry mix. These turned out rather nicely and this is worth another try with blueberries next time. Thanks Lori for a great recipe!

These were very quick to put together and were pretty good.  There's lots of potential variations, which makes it fun.  I made coconut muffins by adding one cup of coconut and then used a sugar, coconut, butter, cinnamon topping (from Coconut Muffins - Sue G.).

thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!  the muffins whipped up in no time at all, clean up was simple and they are deelicious!  i used skim milk because that's all we buy but it wasn't a problem.  i was worried because i filled the muffin cups to the top but see the photo i submitted - they turned out perfect.  the tops were crunchy - just how we like them.  the texture was very good.  a lot of the chocolate chips went to the bottom so i will use minis the next time.  am anxious to try this recipe with some fresh fruit i froze.

Thery were at least the best looking ever muffins. In the recipe it says to pour the batter into muffin pan, but I had to spoon the thick, dry, lumpy, sticky batter into the muffin pan. I know I didn't over mix....maybe I'm not use to the way homemade batter looks. There didn't seem to be enough liquid to cover the flour mix. I might use more milk to the recipe.(?) There's definitely tinkering to be done. Good looking, blah taste.

This is a pretty good starting point.  I like to omit the oil and replace it with about a half cup of apple sauce.  I then toss in some cinnamon chips and a tsp or so of cinnamon.  Makes for a decent low-fat apple cinnamon muffin

Decent, but tried it with cheddar and bacon. Even after decreasing the sugar to 1/2 cup, it was still too sweet.

These are simple and delicious.  I like to mix the dry ingredients and place them in a bag with the instructions on how to prepare them.  Then I give them as Christmas gifts along with a homemade jar of jam.

These were very easy to make a they looked great when they came out of the oven. I added a little vanilla essence and some mini chocolate chips and used the batter to make mini muffins. They were a little bland, but overall quite tasty. Might add more vanilla next time.

Pretty good recipe, worthy of my recipe box as a keeper! I added some shredded zucchini, cinnamon, vanilla, nuts, and added applesauce instead of oil, and put a little streusel topping, thanks!

I made these for my kids this morning, and they said it's five-stars! I added chocolate chips and made the recipe as written.  These were moist, and my kids said these are much better than the muffins I've made in the past from a mix.  Easy, too!

These were good not great. I felt the batter was a bit bland even with added spices and mix-ins. Its nice that I can make more than one kind from the same mix just need to add more flavor.

I use the larger muffin size and cook for 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees. I have used every ingredient under the sun and these muffins always turn out.

I also substituted whole wheat pastry flour, smashed banana instead of oil, rice milk, and a combo of brown sugar and zylitol (an all natural, plant based sugar substitute that looks and tastes like white sugar with 1/3 of the calories and low carb). They came out wonderfully, although I'm sure they bear little resemblance to the original, which I intend to also bake. My 4-year old loved them, and I can eat them without guilt! I think adding the brown sugar helped to give them a beautiful golden brown color. They also peaked nicely on top. I got carried away on the blueberries, too many and I had to add time to the cooking.

This worked out great. I used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown, then added 1 t. vanilla, 1 t. cinnamon, and 1/2 cup oats. For one batch mixed-in 1 cup chocolate chips, and for the other batch I stirred in a spoonful of strawberry jam. 

The were very tasty and highly complimented. The only caveat is that the ones with jam spilled over the muffin cups (I am sure I overfilled, but be careful of this). As others have said, they only took 20 minutes to cook. 

Great recipe!

Just finished baking three dozen of these, half with blackberries and half with strawberries and chocolate chips on top, and they are fantastic! I used frozen fruit and it was juts fine. Light and fluffy, though not a sweet muffin. I upped it to a cup of sugar instead for the blackberry muffins and they were better.

This recipe is meant to be a base for a muffin that you create.  I added fresh blueberries and swirled sweetened cream cheese with a struesel top.  TO DIE FOR! Very moist!

My professional chef neighbor pronounced them "heaven", and believe me, he isn't afraid to hold back when something isn't quite right with a recipe.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was extremely easy to make, but the flavor was 'flat'. It needs a teaspoon of vanilla to give it dimension. I found the recipe for Blueberry Cream Muffins submitted by Kim to be much more flavorful.

hmmmmm....the best? I have to be honest and say I haven't made many homemade muffins. I guess I was looking for something (a base) that tasted like my favorite deli's cranberry muffin. I made some plain and then added apple to the others. I did 1/2 reg milk and 1/2 buttermilk. One of the regular ones tasted like the cornbread muffin at boston market, which is definately not a bad thing, a little sweet but not too much. Oh, I also cut down on sugar to 1/2 cup, as suggested, but will probably do 3/4 if i make again. I also added streusal to the apple ones and sprinkled honey butter from the site on each muffin. Overall they were tasty and easy.

This recipe was perfect! I needed a yummy spice muffin so this is what I did: Used 1 cup white and 1 cup wheat flour, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 cup chopped pecans, & 1/2 cup multi grain oats. When filling the tins I filled tin 1/4 way then sprinkled a sugar/cinnamon mixture then filled tin to about 2/3 full. I also added melted butter to the top at the end of baking. DELICIOUS! Thanks for such a great muffin recipe!

Great basic muffin recipe.  Reduced sugar to 1/2c, added 1c partially thawed frozen halved strawberries, then sprinkled just a bit of sugar atop before baking.  Yum!!!  Everyone in the family loved them!  I think if making a savory version, I'd further reduce sugar--they were sweet, but not sickening ;)  Can't wait to make cheese muffins or bacon/parmesan....

This is an excellent base recipe for muffins.  Easy and fun to tweak to your liking.  I recommend replacing some of the white sugar for brown sugar and using unsweetend applesauce in lieu of oil.  Delicious!

I made these for Christmas morning and they were incredible.  I used 7-8 slices of bacon and a little over 1 cup of shredded cheddar as my adders.  The muffins have a slightly sweet taste to them and put together with the cheese and bacon...yummy.  I served with scrambled eggs on the side.

These muffins are great!  I reduced the flour to 1-1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup ground brown flaxseed.  Also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Batter seemed a bit wet, so I then added 2 T additional flour then finished off with 1 cup blueberries plus 1/2 cup blackberries.  They raised nicely and baked golden brown in 20 minutes.  (Try adding ground flaxseed--it adds a slightly nutty crunch and is very healthy!)

These were hands down the worst muffins I have ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, step by step, no substitutions. I'm an excellent cook and have made many muffins before with great results, but I have never seen anything like this. They were as bland as could possibly be, and the cook time was all wrong. My oven cooks things to perfection every time, but I could smell these burning 3 minutes before the time ran out, so I took them out early and they were completely burnt and dry. Horrible.

Absolutely excellent muffins. I've made them a couple of times already and plan to make them again. Lovely texture and very durable- I've made them with chocolate chips and cranberries, as well as chocolate chips and cocoa. They're great! :)

So simple but tastes like you spent hours. I made this with my daughter during one of our baking days. We put it in a 9x13 and decided to add white and milk chocolate chips. When the cake cooled we used a semi sweet chocolate drizzle and cut it into squares. She was so excited, she insisted we have a tea party and serve the cake!

I am giving these muffins 5 stars for their brilliant texture. They are soft and moist. Obviously the flavour is dependant on the particular cook, and what they decide to add, but these muffins will suit most additions. I added apricots, 1/2 pureed and 1/2 chopped. I would recommend being generous with any additions, as mine didn't have enough apricot flavour. However, they were still very tasty sweet muffins.

I really like this basic muffin recipe.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also placed a spoonful of strawberry preserves into the center of the muffin.  Can't wait to try the savory ones.

This is such a great recipe because it's so easy & versatile!  I made two different kinds of muffins, chocolate chip & struesel cinnamon.  I did add a tsp of vanilla, but everything else was exactly to the recipe.  These did not last long in my house!  I can't wait to try all the different varieties.  Thanks Lori!

At last, a cake recipe that I can experiment with. You can add just about anything to the batter, and it comes out wonderful. Two of my favorites are blackberry with dark chocolate chips and apple with walnuts and cinnamon. I love this recipe!

I think this would be a great sweet muffin such as blue berry muffins.  I wanted a savory muffin so I added cheddar cheese, but with all that sugar it was too sweet.  We had sweet muffins with our soup.  It wasn't bad flavored, but best as a fruit or chocolate chip type muffin.

I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't think these were anything special.  I made them twice.  There isn't enough flavor or texture to even call it a muffin.  It is a cupcake.

I guess this might be good for sweet muffins, but I used it as a basis for savoury muffins and even though I reduced the sugar to 1/4C, they were still far too sweet.  I had my doubts about including sugar at all, but wasn't confident the muffins would work if I eliminated it completely.
I may try this again for a sweet muffin.

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! These are the BEST muffins I have ever made! They are very moist, light, and fluffy. I used 1/3 cup oil instead of 1/4 cup and I also added vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, and chocolate chips. And instead of making 12 I made 5 jumbo muffins. Perfect!

Excellent. You could do almost anything with this recipe as a starter. I made 2 batches, one with 1 cup chocolate chips, kids loved them, and the other with a well drained tin of crabmeat and 2 Tbs. chopped red pepper.They were awesome!

Not too bad, a bit dry though.  I followed the suggestion and added more oil, but a bit more would have been better (1/2 cup maybe).  I made mine with chocolate chips.  I will try this again maybe with some blueberries.

I've never made muffins before, and excluding my first attempt (I stirred the batter with a wooden spoon instead of a fork, resulting in a dense goo), they turned out great, especially considering the simplicity of the recipe.  I made a few alterations; I used applesauce instead of oil and vanilla soy milk instead of regular milk and they turned out great, without a noticable difference in taste.  I used frozen blackberries for my addition, and I got very positive reviews from my friends.  All around great recipe.

These were wonderful! They turned out better than any mix I've ever tried. I used "craisins" (about 1 cup), about 1/2 cup of sliced almonds and 1/2 tsp. of pure almond extract. They really were GREAT!

Not normally a baker of sweet things, I tried this recipe for my husband.  I used a cup of white chocolate and the muffins were superb.  Then I tried the savoury ideas and it worked brilliantly.  Thank you so much.  It's brilliant.

I was pleased with these muffins. I put lemon extract and poppyseeds in half the batch and blackberry jam in the other. (I think I may have put too much jam in them though because they didn't rise as much as the lemon.) Thanks for submitting such a versatile recipe!

I was impressed by the reviews but mine didnt quite turn out! I added oats and raisins but they turned out un-risen and dense- like little rock cakes! Perhaps I'll just use self-raising flour next time. I also had to add a fair bit more milk than directed, to accomodate the extra dry ingredients. Because of the great reviews though I will try again.

Holy moly!  I didn't do anything fancy with these (considering the lack of supplies in my college apartment) but the simplicity of the recipe and the absolute TASTINESS are so good!  I only have a 6-cup tin and they got done in about 20 minutes in my  oven.  Deeeeeeelicious :-9

I agree this is a great base recipe.  You can add whatever your heart desires.  I actually did the blueberry the first time and added more than called for and they were wonderful.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I just made this recipe for the first time, adding 3-4 heaping teaspoons of peanut butter to the batter and a teaspoon of grape jelly to the middles before baking...DELICIOUS!!  My 3 1/2 year old loves them and even helped me make them!  I can't wait to experiment more with additions and maybe even toppings!

I've been using this recipe for two years now, trying it with a variety of additions.  My stepmunchkins love it when I make these muffins with just about anything in them, but the latest favorite is cinnamon covered raisins.  They eat them for breakfast and then request them for an after-school snack.  I give this recipe 10 thumbs up (hey, two thumbs for each family member)!

This basic muffin recipe was great. I added half a cup of porridge oats and half a cup of raisins and the result was yummy. I will now try them with walnuts and apples and a slight touch of cinnamon. They are very quick and simple to make

These didn't turn out so great (perhaps because I overbaked them a bit), but I am going to try them again.  I loved the simplicity of the recipe.

I made this recipe with bananas and it turned out VERY well. I'll be trying peaches next with a little of the juice added, but for the skeptics out there, this really is a good recipe - give it a try.

I LOVE this recipe!  I have added a new twist to it for luxurious flavour...  try adding two squares of white chocolate (chopped up) and one cup of mixed berries for a heavenly taste.  My dad loved them so much he wanted to learn how to make them himself!

Great recipe - easily adapted to be allergen friendly! I made this recipe as stated but adapted it to be df/gf. I subbed King Arthur Measure for Measure Gluten Free flour in place of wheat flour. I subbed soy milk in place of dairy milk. I did have to double the milk, which his to be extorted with GF flour subs. This made for a light and fluffy muffin base. To the base, I added 1tsp cinnamon, a cup of grated carrots and fresh raspberries. My df/gf son will LOVE having these for breakfast. I’m sure be making these on a regular basis. Next time I’ll add some other veggies and seeds along with fruit to give my kiddo some good vitamins with his breakfast treat.

I don't understand all the rave reviews. I made this recipe exactly as it was supposed to be (adding blueberries) and it was so flavorless. It definitely needs more sugar. Texture was fine and bake time on point but needs way more sugar.

I’ve made this recipe several times for breakfast events at my church. I normally make 4 dozen, adding 24 ounces of frozen blueberries (2 bags) and the zest of 2-4 lemons. They come out very tender and not too sweet. Great recipe!

I made half of the recipe with cocoa powder, walnuts, a teaspoon of espresso and milk chocolate chunks. 
The other half I did it with matcha and white chocolate chunks. 
It was awesome I will just add a little bit of sugar but  I love the variety of flavors you can make with this recipe, you just have to think of your favorite and its ready.

I made it using the exact recipe, and yes, it turns out really nice! Made it with my four-year-old who insisted to do all the mixing and wanted to add blueberries and jam in the middle. For the next batch, I am thinking to lessen the sugar as I find it too sweet. Other than that, it is indeed a great and versatile recipe.

Easiest ever to make, and most scrumptious!  During the season of fresh cranberries, I add diced candied orange peel. Fruit quantities optional. I love them rich!  
Made like this, they descended from Heaven.

Sprinkled Turbinado sugar on top and made mini muffins, cook time 15 min. Half the batch was blueberry and the other half apples and cinnamon. So tastey and easy.

Added 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/2 cup chopped almonds, 1/2 cup chopped cranberries, and cooked at 400 for 22 minutes. Slightly over cooked... will be cooking less next time, but definitely making again!

This recipe was SOOOO great! It was the first muffin recipe I came across and super easy. I didn't make any changes, and when these came out of the oven, my family tried to steal some right away. I'll definitely make these again, possibly every day if my parents let me. My siblings faces lit up when they bit into these muffins. Loved these! Thanks Lori!

I used butter instead of oil and I did beat it (on my hand mixer's lowest setting), I don't have time to fold all that flour and get it smooth. 

I added a cup of apples and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. I then put a scoop of vanilla frosting on while they were still warm to melt over the top. Everyone loved it.

Easy, basic, yummy.  Followed the recipe exactly and added fresh blueberries.  At first I agreed it was a little bland, then I had one with butter on it and OMG it was delicious in its simplicity.  It’s exactly what a muffin should be and was a great recipe to make with the kids!

Yes I will definitely make it again. I used a cup and a half of blueberries. I use brown sugar instead of granulated sugar for the crumble.

Absolutely perfect! I used 1/4 cup of bacon in the batter, but the muffin by itself is still tasty. to get them to dome, first preheat to 425° and once you put them in preheat it back to 400°. Will make this again!

Very easy recipe, great way to use stuff up in your pantry.  

for those that commented that they turned out dense I would have to say that they probably over mixed the batter. 

Mixing batter until “just combined” means that you should stop mixing as soon as you can't see the ingredient that you just added.  When you overmix batter, the gluten in the flour can form elastic gluten strands – resulting in a more dense, chewy texture.

I thought the recipe was super basic. Why is there no butter? It seems like that would add flavor and richness to these otherwise bland muffins. I added cinammon sugar on top, and I liked that, but I think that without this added kick, the muffins would be very distasteful. It needs something else. Also, I baked mine for only 20 minutes, not 25. The muffins are a little crumbly on the outside and stick to the wrappers. In the instructions, it says the battter would be lumpy, however mine was smooth. Why would lumpy batter be preferable? Overall, these muffins need something added to them, but are a very good basic recipe that anyone can get creative with.

Really like this recipe.  I made one batch with frozen blueberries and a second batch with apples and coconut. I found that I needed just a bit more milk. Thank you for the recipe. I know I’ll be making it again.

These muffins were very delicious, and how fast it took to make and bake was amazing as well! TIP: In a small bowl juice a lemon, add powdered sugar, and some heavy whipping cream. Stir it together. With a spoon, drizzle the "frosting" or "sweet sauce" on top of the muffins and it will taste amazing! Without the frosting the muffins are lonely and nothing to party in your mouth with. But, in other words, the muffins were truly delicious.

Simple but great results. After the first batch I did use a pan of water on the shelf below to keep the tops of the muffins soft. This is my go-to recipe for muffins.

I cut the sugar and salt in half and doubled the eggs. I also made a double batch. I put in a half cup of crushed walnuts per recipe, a half cup of dark chocolate chips per recipe and 1 cup of chopped dates per recipe.
My  husband really liked them.

This was an easy and delicious muffin recipe! My son is a big fan of Panera's Chocolate Chip Muffies, so I added chocolate chips and baked for 12 minutes in a muffie pan... they were a hit with the kids and will be a huge money saver on weekend mornings!

I'm a wreck in the kitchen when it comes to cooking and baking (eating, no problem), this recipe saved my toosh. Had no veg oil so replaced it with coconut oil. Made batch 1 with blueberries and batch 2 with dark chocolate chips... perfect. Honestly, were the best I ever made and ate.

My first try and my husband loves it. The texture turns out awesome. Not dry at all. But I feel  it is not that sweet enough with the amount of sugar required in the recipe.  Other than that, it's worth trying.

Worst Ever Muffins

I took the hype bait and wound up disappointed. These muffins are bland and floury (I don’t overmeasure). I used fresh ingredients. I added a cup of blueberries. A previous review was right, it does need sour cream and lemon zest to taste right.

Love this versatile recipe.  I used one cup of all purpose flour and one cup of whole wheat flour to add more fiber.   Also, I decreased the sugar to less than 1/4 cup of white sugar and added the following: one smashed banana, one big spoon of strawberry jam and 2 spoonfuls of cooked steel cut oatmeal in the batter.  Due to these modifications, the bake time is 30 minutes total.  After checking with a toothpick, I decided to leave the muffins inside the oven for another 5 minutes to use the residual heat after turning the oven off to prevent over baking.  Then I transferred them to a cooling racks and let them stay there for about 10 minutes.  The muffins came out moist and spongy.  I was very pleased with the result.  Although I couldn’t quite taste the strawberry jam but the sweetness was perfect for me.  I love any recipe that can produce a spongy muffin or cake without using an electric beater because I hate washing the attachments.  Bon appetit!

This is my ultimate go to muffin recipe! My SIL and her hubby loved them so much they bought me a muffin pan that bakes 24 at a time to butter me up to give them the recipe! Of course, I would have for nothing because no matter what mix ins I use, they always turn out great! I do start the oven at 425° and then turn it down right after putting the muffins in to get tall, fluffy results. I only use this recipe!

We added blueberries and a banana to the mix and used unsweetened Almond Milk in place of regular milk. It was delicious! Especially right out of the oven with a smidegen of butter!

Love this base muffin recipe!  Whole family love them!  First batch was made with cranberry cast off from juicing. Delicious!  Second, added fresh frozen blueberries, cinnamon, lemon zest. Yum!  Can’t wait to try different additions & flavours.

FINALLY! An easy  very tasty muffin recipe that I can add my favorite ingredients too!  With one batch I made 6 cinnamon maple muffin tops and 6 jumbo chocolate chip, Kit Kat muffins. I used my small chocolate wafers and mini Kit Kat bars. The flavor is just great. Will make this my muffin recipe from now on.

Exactly what I was looking for to use as a base muffin recipe.  Crumb is really light and fluffy and not too sweet - perfect to add other ingredients.  I added some frozen blueberries and they popped in my mouth - delish!

I made these for Youth Day at church and made several varieties using this base recipe.  They all turned out great and were a big hit. It is a great recipe and now my go to. I do recommend the tip about preheating the oven to 425 and then reducing the oven temp to 400 after you put the muffins in. It does make them dome beautifully.  Delicious!

This was the perfect base recipe for muffins. I added in a cup of diced apple (1 apple), a 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts and 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon and they baked absolutely perfect. I will definitely be keeping this at hand for future recipes.

I added a teaspoon of rose syrup, 1/4 cup of unsweetened coconut, and maybe a cup of strawberries and they turned out delicious.  My oven also runs a little hot so I started it at 400 then lowered it to 350 when I put the muffins in and baked for approx 20 minutes.  I think this is my new go-to muffin recipe

They are perfectly fine muffins, not the best ever.  I found they were lacking in some flavor, although they were still worth making since the recipe was so easy.  If you are looking for a muffin that's not too sweet, this is a good recipe.  I would only make these for my household, I would not bring them to an event.

Very easy recipe! I tried half a batch with raisins and another half with coconut shredding. My first time baking muffins and am just happy with their shape. Tastes good too! Next time more variants. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I follow the base recipe exactly plus 1 tsp vanilla extract and a cup of chocolate chips. They were awesome! I made 24 mini muffins, baked them about 16-17 mins. Everyone raved about them. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

Wonderful! Made really moist muffins. I followed the directions exactly, plus put in a half cup of blueberries and chocolate chips and baked for about 11 minutes (I'm in Colorado) . I sprayed my muffin tins with coconut oil cooking spray and they popped out perfectly shaped.

Excellent muffins! I made with raisins (used whole raisins, did not cut them up). They are slightly sweet but not too sweet and perfectly light but filling. The tops have a slight crunch.

A great basic. I made it as written but added blackberries. Made 12 large muffins. This recipe is just right for sweetness and texture for me. Not too dense but not light and fluffy. Sweet enough but not totally sweet so the berries are a nice plus. Will make these again and again. Will have to put them in the freezer so I won't eat them all!

i think it would make a GREAT sweet muffin, but for a savory muffin not so much, i used 1/4 cup sugar and a couple extra pinches salt (i was afraid to add too much), then added sharp cheddar cheese and half a green bell pepper and it was good BUT i still think less sugar and more salt... i might add another egg or something next time too, for a denser muffin? not sure if that would make it denser but lol we will see, but it is a very good starting recipe :)  

Edit: i made these as make ahead breakfast things to freeze, but then i ate them all.... >_> so no easy breakfasts lol

Update: I made these again.  all i changed was 1 tablespoon sugar instead of 3/4 cup, 1 teaspoon salt instead of 1/2 teaspoon, 1/8 teaspoon granulated garlic, sharp cheddar cheese, and half a green bell pepper.  I also kept adding a bit of milk untill the batter was more of a thick batter than a dry tough one.  i baked it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes instead of 25... i think they take longer because im at 2000+ feet above sea level.... and they. were. SOMEHOW. even better than before.... they are like if a cheese god and a pepper god and a muffin god all came together to create one amazing miracle lol

This is a great base recipe. I sub half the flour for wheat flour and oats, and add my extras to the dry mix before adding wet ingredients. This keeps you from having all the nuts/chocolate/fruit/whatever fall to the bottom. This is the perfect recipe to keep on hand for busy mornings when you're sick of toast.

I adapted this awesome recipe to make it Gluten-free and added my own twist to yield a hi-protein, hi-fiber yummy treat the kids LOVE! Quite a bit more work, but important extra steps to yield light & fluffy moist texture when not using traditional wheat flour.

Double Chocolate Muffins: 
1+1/3 c. Spelt flour,
2/3 c. Teff flour,
1/4 c. Ground sweet cocoa,
2/3 c. Sugar, 
1/3 t. Salt,
1/2 c. Chocolate Chips. 
Blend well, make a "well", set aside.

Separate 2 eggs- 
Mix well in medium bowl:
2 eggs yolks,
1 c. Milk,
1/4 c. Melted Butter, 
1 t. Vanilla. 

In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks. Gently FOLD egg whites into liquid mixture. Then, add liquid to dry ingredients, blending gently. Of course, DO NOT OVERMIX! 

Baked 18-20 mins at 400.
Yield: 12 medium-sized muffins.

Thank you, this recipe is definitely a great one! Love them! Very moist only thing I found was it only took about 17 minutes not 25 just keep an eye on the oven.

Everyone loved these muffins! So I made them again with blueberries and coconut. They were super easy and I followed someone's tip to preheat to 425, then reduce to 400 when putting them in the oven. That gave them a nice dome.

By far the best and most versatile muffin recipe. Honestly you don't need another one. I've tried substituting some apple sauce for the oil, yogurt for the milk, etc. and they always turn out great. I've frozen the batter and made later which works just fine (for those lazy weekends and your child is demanding muffins). I've turned this recipe into amazing strawberry rhubarb muffins. Just a fantastic base muffin recipe to grow from.

It's healthy due to the minimal ingredients. I lowered the amount of sugar by a little and it still tasted good.
I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.
I added mini semisweet chocolate chips to 4 muffins, dried cranberries to 4 muffins and left the rest plain. All flavours taste amazing!
Finally, I did not bake for the full 25 minutes, it started turning brown and burning quite quickly. Next time, I would bake for 18-20 minutes as 400 degrees is quite high.

The baking went really well!  I added in 1/2 cup of mulberries to my muffins and they tasted delicious. The recipe is very simple, yet it allows us to mix and add in all sorts of variations. It's great for beginners.

Definitely NOT the best I've ever made or eaten.  I did add fresh blueberries, and I used buttermilk, so these should have been extremely moist, but they weren't.   Probably won't use this recipe again.  Sorry.

I've been using this recipe for approx. 3 years. I put a dollop of batter in the cupcake liner, add a handful of mixed berries, apple butter, banana, banana and peanut butter, fresh strawberries,  etc.  (pick one, they all work - very versatile recipe) , then add another dollop of batter to complete the muffin. . I also substitute a 1/2 cup of oat bran for 1/2 cup of flour, to add valuable fiber to our diet. Definitely a "best ever"!!

Definitely my new go to for basic muffins. I separated the batter into 3 parts. I ended up with 5 muffins in each flavour for variety:

Blueberry-Amaretto-flax (3/4 cup fresh blueberries, 3/4 ounce Amaretto, 1/4 cup flax)

Banana-Chocolate-flax (1/4 cup chopped milk chocolate -chips will do-, half a banana - diced, 1/4 cup flax seeds)

Lemon-Raspberry (1 cup Raspberries, juice of one squeezed lemon and about a table spoon of zest) 

They were delicious. This recipe gave me about 15 medium/small muffins.

Since my search was for a "basic muffin recipe",  I wasn't disappointed. These were quite good, especially with a heaping cup of fresh blueberries folded in at the last minute before baking. I used sour milk because I had to use it up. Next time I make them, I'll put in dried cranberries and walnut pieces instead of blueberries. The recipe yielded 14 of the smaller-sized muffins that we prefer.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the addition of about 3/4 cup of raisins. My husband and I both liked them, but I did find them a little bit dense, almost like a biscuit. The raisins gave a nice, sweet flavour, but I imagine it would have been a bit bland without them. Will likely try it again with other additions.

These muffins came out really tasty! I baked them just as the recipe said. First time I tried with 1 cup candied fruit mix (tutti fruitti) in the batter, came out awesome. Second time I used 1 cup of chocolate chip, they came out moist, fluffy, soft and just about right sweetness, loved them!

I've made this about 4 times now, using various things. I usually replace the egg with banana.  The next time I'm making it I'm using Diet Orange Crush to replace the egg, and I'm also going to put dried cranberries in it.

Because of  allergies I made these using Cup 4 Cup GF flour. I wanted a basic muffin recipe without presevatives  and artificial anything. I followed the recipe exactly and then added frozen blueberries . These were Fantastic! and fluffy!  and delicious ! which is a difficult thing  when making gluten free, wheat free and soy free  foods. 
I can't wait to make these again with different add in combinations.  This recipe is a keeper!!!!
Thanks!

I could not find my recipe for muffins so I decided to look on line.  I found this one, sounded easy to make with ingredients I had at home.  Made them this morning and added some Craisins to the batter. Couldn't wait to taste them and they live up to the "Best Ever Muffins."  Yum

Added a tablespoon of orange zest for flavour and half a cup of raisins was plenty. 
Easy recipe and accurate baking timing. Will make again!

I like this recipe. I used honey and maple syrup instead of sugar. They were a little bit dry, but not bad whatsoever. I made them for my daughter's school snack to share with the class, and I added chocolate chips and very finely shredded carrots for some secret nutrition :)

I agree, totally the best ever. I have tried so many recipes for basic muffins. this one had only 1 egg and oil, never seen a recipe for muffins like that, but when I tried it - wow, the muffin tops came out perfect, the muffins were moist and delicious. thank you for this recipe!!

I made it just now for breakfast for my family and it was nice. To me it makes a dozen but maybe that's because I filled it a little bit to much but they were ok. LOL right now there in the oven so I'll show my results in 5 minutes. Thank your for such an easy recipe. It helped a lot and I might make this again but definitely triple the recipe and add vanilla or nutmeg or cinnamon.

New at baking and first time to make muffins. This was really easy to make and adding different ingredients was a breeze. I made carrot, cheddar, peanuts, orange and plain to try. Next batch will be fruits and chocolate... Yum!!!

I used Hershey's cocoa powder, vanilla extract, & milk chocolate chips for a flavor combination in these muffins. 

The flavor was okay, not sweet enough for us, but I won't try this recipe again. They turned out quite dry & heavy & hard.

Reading others reviews, perhaps I over-mixed these too much (approximately 90 seconds), or baked them a few minutes too long? (25 minutes as directed). I expect I made an error, not the recipe itself.

They were easy & quick to prepare. But there are other muffin recipes that I have found to be much more moist & light & delicious & reliable, that are foolproof! (For a person like me who rarely bakes... I really need foolproof & reliable when the Muffin Mood strikes haha!) (banana crumb muffins on this website are my go-to & are flawless for a non-baker like me FYI)

So good. Just don't over cook. And don't over mix. Adding fruit makes them even more enjoyable.

These were very good, I just thought they were a little dry without anything else in them and with some blueberries or chocolate chips, they'd be better. Good recipe though, the batter can sit a day or two and will only taste better.

This was very disappointing. I expected a tasty muffin base, but it was extremely plain (even after adding vanilla). I added a cup of blackberries hoping for some beautiful blackberry muffins but the blackberries ended up being the only flavourful component of this recipe. More importantly, there is TOO LITTLE OIL. My muffins baked up beautifully but they got stuck to the paper muffin holders and eating them, or even peeling them away from the paper was a chore and a mess. For those who insist on this recipe, I'd increase the oil to about 1/2 cup and add at least 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Good luck.

I made this recipe one night at 2am because I couldn't sleep. I absolutely love it. I added 1 and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla and it was perfect. So good by themselves, buttered, or with coffee. I also used instead of milk (because my milk was expired and I couldnt go to the store being that it was 2am) a half cup of water with a half cup of evaporated milk and it tasted just the same! Exactly what I wanted.

These were OK, but I liked "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" better. I left out the blueberries and strudel topping to just compare that recipe to this one, and it was better. It was fluffier and tastier. This one was flatter and just not quite as good.

Wow!  I've been making this recipe for a while, but today I did a few things differently.   These muffins were amazing! 1) Use whole wheat flour 2) Cut back on the sugar (I used 1/2 cup, but next time I am going to try 1/4 cup.). 3) Omit oil 4) Use 1/2 cup of milk 5) Mix two mashed bananas (1 cup) in the wet mixture.   6) Add 1/2 of nuts (I used almond slivers.).

Not great for savoury muffins. I made it exactly as written, and added grated cheese. There is way too much sugar in this recipe for a cheese muffin. I'd try it for sweet muffins, but not cheese, which was one of the suggestions. Also, I baked them for only 20 mins, and they were still dry. Probably won't make again.

I absolutely loved these muffins.  I added a cup of raisins and a tablespoon of cinnamon, and baked them until they were golden on top, and removed them from tray right away as I learned that keeps the middle fluffy.  I also substituted the sugar for 18 packets of splenda since my dad has diabetes and is always looking for something he can enjoy.

In the photo I took: back left are khalua muffins (used premade khalua drink mix), right are vanilla raspberry, bottom are savory green onion sharp white cheddar. I didn't have cups so I think they got kind of dry. Otherwise fun mix to play with!

Good flavor but these were a little bit dry. I added cinnamon and vanilla extract to the batter and folded in a cup of chopped cranberries. I topped off the muffins with cinnamon sugar before baking. I want to give these another try in the hopes that they won't be so dry next time. Thanks!

A super easy recipe and it's quite good. I added cinnamon, chocolate chips and hazelnuts. The only problem was that I only baked them for 20 minutes and they still came out slightly overbaked and a little drier than I had expected. Maybe it's just my oven or they might need a little more olive oil. Also, it made only 10 small muffins instead of 12.

I've tried it a few times. First time I added blackberry/cherry puree. It worked great and I used it more. I also Tried it with strawberry puree, that's in the oven now... I bet it's gonna taste good!

I use this recipe as a base and then add other ingredients to it: cheese and onion, apples and cinnamon, etc. I'd have to say that it is almost a no-fail recipe! It is fantastic!

Not bad as some have said. Don't know what they did wrong. I used Splenda instead of sugar. Not the greatest tasting muffins but very edible and cheap. Better than paying $1.50 for one in the store with a million calories. Quick and easy to make. Time a little long, they were done in like 10 minutes. I plan to use some choc chips or blueberries or whatever next time I make them. I also plan to keep batter in fridge and make 1 or two when I feel like it and add fruit or choc chips as I feel like to base batter.

I tried this recipe, and the muffins were really dry. I made them a second time, and I increased the oil to 1/2 cup and increased to two eggs. Also, I added in bananas. They were very good.

The muffins were great!  The muffins were really light and fluffy and had a great texture.  They were golden brown on the outside and crispy yet soft.  I added chocolate chips and fruit.  The flavor with the added ingrediants was amazing.  I recommend this quick, easy, and great recipe

Really great recipe. The muffins were really tasty and had a good texture. It was soft and yummy. I put chocolate chips and jam in the muffins which made the recipe even better.

these were ok, baked up a little dry for me - but very disappointed that I followed the recipe and then did a variation with cheese and bacon.  The sugar really spoiled it for me.  I had made them quickly so I could share some with my neighbor who turned 80 today, then felt like I had to apologize for them. Didn't have any more muffin papers or bacon, so I went with them.  Why I didn't think about the combination as I made them, I don't know but with all the rave reviews, I just didn't think about it.  :-(

This is my go-to for basic muffins. I usually add cinnamon, sometimes ginger and cloves. Never tried to make the savory muffins with this recipe but if I did, I'd cut way back on the sugar. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe that can be the base for multiple muffin options. I added 1 tsp of banana flavor and 8 ounces of chopped pecans to one batch and vanilla flavor to the other and they were both delicious. Although the recipe says it's for 12 muffins, it's 12 of the smaller muffins. I use a bakery muffin sized pan so the recipe, as is, made 6 large muffins.

I feel a little bad rating this because I didn't try it as written, but I'm mostly rating for my own benefit. I used white whole wheat flour and subbed almond milk for the regular milk. The muffins were moist and fluffy. I added blueberries, and they were just scrumptious!

Great recipe, I've used it twice. The first time I made the muffins as written, and added about 1/2 cup blueberries and 1 mashed ripe banana. They were good, but not quite sweet enough and a little on the tough side (I think that may have been my fault, I overmixed the batter). The next time they turned out perfectly, and here's what I did: instead of all white sugar I used 1/4 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I used two mashed, very ripe bananas, and I think those added some moisture and reduced the "toughness". I then poured the batter into the cupcake molds, almost filling each one (I had leftover batter both times). I shoved about 1/4 of a strawberry down into the batter of each one (left a little showing on top). Then I placed some sliced almonds on top of each. I baked them for about 15-20 mins at 375 (I live at high altitude, so this is always different for me). My picky family agreed that these muffins were absolute perfection, thanks Lori!

Other than the cooking time, these muffins are AWESOME!  I know my oven is hotter than most so I reduced the heat to 375 instead of 400 and checked them after 12 minutes.  In 15 minutes they were totally done.  25 minutes and they would have been dried up prunes in my oven.  Now, having said that, the muffins were GREAT. I added cranberries and the zest and juice of one lemon (added the milk to the lemon juice to make one cup - which curdled the milk and made like a buttermilk).  This will be my "go to" muffin recipe for adding fruit and candies from now on.

These turned out delicious. I had to substitute peanut oil for vegetable oil (as I ran out of VO yesterday) but it worked fine. My choice of filling was raspberries and coconut and it turned out delicious! My son, who is a picky eater, ate two full muffins which is almost unheard of! I look forward to other variations on this muffin in the future.

The recipe is perfect, I just added an egg yolk, 1/2 cup of yogurt and 1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the mentioned ingredients to make it more tender and tasteful. My muffins came spongy and moistened then.

was looking for a basic recipieso that I could modify it for my health-nut ingredients.  This recipie fit the bill perfectly.  I  subtituted whole wheat flour but less 1/2c which I used almond meal instead.  Used Flax meal for egg substitute but doubled the amount to equal 2 eggs just to be sure. Applesauce instead of oil. Vanilla soymilk instead of milk.  Sea Salt (about 1/2 the amount) and honey instead of sugar.  Added  berries. Tried PB but that didn't work.  Want to experiment with maple syrup instead of sugar soon.  Anyways, They are great healthy breakfast muffins!  i agree with others who say they are versitile and as fun as you make them. Also, I do in toaster oven so I lower temp just a bit and have to watch. 2nd batch got a little too brown for me.

I added two ripe plantains, toasted coconut and chopped pineapples and I also added a crumb topping. They were moist and VERY delicious!

Delicious, quick and simple muffins.  I did add chopped strawberries and vanilla.  They have an excellent texture and taste.  I'll be making these often with different variations.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Lori.

Tried this recipe with blueberries added in, and the flavor was absent. The texture was okay, which is the only reason I gave these three stars instead of one. They had a nice crusty top and a fluffy middle, but were a bit too dense and doughy. I followed the recipe exactly, and know not to stir the batter too much, so that isn't the issue. 

I think these would be better with certain add ins, but does that really make the base recipe any better? I don't think so.

Well named recipe as the result was delicious. Nice crusty top and just right for 12 muffins. I added sultanas and used 1/2 wholemeal flour. Very successful.

Followed this recipe to a "t" and these have to be the worst muffins I've ever tried! I've made some other muffins using different recipes in the past but this recipe is terrible. Would not recommend it at all.

I loved this recipe! I baked it with blueberries, and sprinkled some brown sugar on top. My whole family loved them (including me)! 
 It was fun and easy. The only part my mom had to do for me was to put them in the oven, and take them out.  

                                                               You should try them too! :-)

Not 'the best ever', but ok.  I added 1/2 cup of cocoa to make chocolate muffins.  3/4 cup of sugar is not enough in my opinion.

Amazing recipe! I used 3 tbsp of mayonnaise instead of the egg (only because I was out of eggs). I added white chocolate chips and pumpkin pie spice, perfect for Fall! So moist and not overly sweet. I will be using this as my base recipe for all muffins from here on out!

Wow. Very easy, very tasty. I made 24... I made several different "flavors"...cherry ice cream topping, strawberry preserves, cheese, chocolate chips, and plain. May I say plain with butter while still warm is absolutely delicious. The kids chose the chocolate chip. I can note...I simply spooned both the runnier cherry topping into the muffin and also the thick strawberry preserves. The thicker preserves baked much more nicely. I wont use thinner add ins next time. Very happy with this treasure of a recipe.

I think this is an excellent base recipe which can be easily modified to make it more healthy and/or have different flavors. I add cocoa powder and chocolate chips for choc muffins, substitute 1 cup of white flour for wholemeal flour, substitute sugar for stevia baking crystals and so on and they always turn out great no matter what I do with them. Other muffins recipes always call for more eggs or sugar and seem way more unhealthy than these ones.

It was the first time I made muffins and it did come out very nice and risen. But I have to say it was really very plain eventhough I added the raisins.  I should have put in some of the substitutions.

WOWweeee!  My newly-vegan husband loved my spin on these:  Used 1/2 c. almond milk, no egg, no oil, one cup applesauce instead.  425° for 3 mins, then 400 for 22 more!  I put frozen berries in the batter....DELISH!

My family absolutely adores this recipe. So far we have made cranberry-orange-almond,apple raisin, blueberry lemon, and banana-peanut butter chip-almond, the possibilities are endless. A very quick go to, running out the door during the week and they do not last more than 30 minutes on the weekend.

Absolutely delicious!  I made these exactly as written except added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 cup of halved, frozen cranberries.  They rose beautifully and they are nice and moist and delicious!  This is my new go to muffin recipe!

Delicious, and easy to alter for different flavors.  Today I added raisins, cinnamon, and some vanilla (also some wheat germ for nutrition).

Had to try them because of the lower cal count... not sweet but that could be because I used tart additions. Did a double batch with 2 tsp lemon extract and a cup of cranberries cut into 1/2's. First tray came out and hubby and I each thought they needed something sweeter and some more flavor. The next tray went in with the zest of a small lemon and a 1/4 of a cup of amber agave nectar and drizzled the tops with some more agave. Also watch your oven while cooking them... I had to lower the temp on the 2ed batch to 375F because they came out almost burnt on the top and batter in the very middle at 20 mins. My 2ed tray came out much better but I think I will have to bite the bullet and just go with a higher cal count muffin for the AM.

I'm undecided on these. Somethimes they're pretty good other times, decidedly rubbery.  I like how easy they are to make but they're definitely best right out of the oven.  Don't keep well at all for the next few days :(

These tasted really good.  Even better the next day, (stayed moist in a container).  I added 3/4 cup frozen blueberries to mine.  Fabulous!  These are very inexpensive and easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe.

The first time I baked this, I followed the recipe to a T, and it came out tasting more like cornbread than muffins. I knew it wouldn't come out right when the batter was lumpy, as described. The second time around, I made some small tweaks, and it came out tasting like muffins! I used 1.5 cups of flour instead of 2, and I didn't have milk, so I used vanilla soy milk instead. Because of that, I cut down the sugar a little. I also added some chocolate chips into the batter.

This is a good base recipe for muffins, so I'll def use it again. Next time I'll try either adding cranberries or blueberries. I would've given it five stars if I didn't have to make any tweaks to the original recipe.

This is a basic recipe, I added in blueberries and a bit of banana in mine. I also added in a bit of vanilla and almond extract. I will add more sugar next time, I did not think they were sweet enough. What I like most about this recipe is that you can add or delete based on your familys preference! Thanks for the recipe I can't wait to try other variations:-)

I've never made muffins before and found this so simple and delicious. I added dark chocolate chips, 1 tsp almond extract, and sprinkled the tops with large crystal decorator's sugar. Delicious!  I can't wait to try a million other variations. Thank you so much for the recipe!

I made this recipe twice first time they were great, I made a half batch and they were gone in hours.  The second time I made a full batch, I added a little bit too much milk (I think) and they were doughy. The next day they were hard.   I might give it another try as one of the best qualities these had were they were so easy to make, really fast.

I agree with the others.  A good base recipe that you can add just about anything to.  Easy to do and it tastes good... it's just not a 'wow' recipe that gets 5 stars from me.

this is great!  I made this recipe into a breakfast bread rather than muffins and it is divine.  I love a recipe that is flexible and uses simple ingredients that I always have on hand.   This one certainly fits the bill.  If you want to add some easy flavor just put in your choice of extract.  I put in some lemon and this was delish!  I have another loaf of blueberry bread in the oven right now.  No one can hardly wait til breakfast!

This is simply the best bacic muffin recipe I have found sense my Mother gave away all the recipes my Grandmother gave me when she passed.  Everyone is asking me to make them as they are not overly sweet and the berries are not masked by sugar.  Thanks again for a simple and first rate recipe.

I did two varations of this recipe.  The first one I did the recipe exactly as written except I added chocolate chips.  The second recipe I got really adventurous, I added a diced mango and subsituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour in place of the white flour.  Then I made a coconut struesel topping.  They turned out very tasty.

I made this exactly as said adding a little vanilla, and flax seeds. They turned out perfect! If your muffins are turning out too brown put some water in a pan next to or underneath the muffins while baking. Also I think you could try less sugar maybe a 1/2 a cup instead.

These were good.  I used banana in mine.  I always use applesauce intead of oil too.  I had a little leftover batter after 12 muffins, so I made mini muffins too.  They cooked about 10 min. with the mini ones. Yum!

great tasting muffins on their own, but I especially loved them as a base for anything else. chocolate chips, fruit, I personally put carrot and raisins in them and they were perfect!

Simple and easy.  Tried with raisins that I had lying around.  I only got 9 muffins but I might have overfilled.  It only took 18 minutes with my oven.  I would watch your muffins closely.  Will be trying other variations soon.  This one is a keeper!

Added in a few extra ingredients: yoghurt and subbed all except one tbsp of oil for applesauce. Threw in half an apple and it tasted great! I like how this recipe is really simple and easy.

This recipe was really good as a basic recipe for muffins! I reduced the vegetable oil by a little bit and only used a quarter of the sugar called for since I don't like to eat food that's too sweet. For my muffins, I added raisins. Would definitely make it again! Next time I will try apple and cinnamon.

Delicious, easy, and versatile.  I make this recipe virtually fat-free by using skim mink, orange juice instead of oil, and egg beaters.

I made mini muffins with this recipe and they turned out great. I tried putting in mandarin oranges, but they didn't taste too orangey. Next time I'll add some orange flavoring or some juice. My nine month old loves them, the mini muffins are just the right size and shape for his hands. Whenever I give him one he gets so excited! I think he's eaten more of them than anyone else in our family!

I cooked the mini muffins at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes and they came out perfect. They taste great warm with a little sweet cream butter on top. Yum!

These are okay. Very bland...even with additions...would take a lot of work to make them really good, but it's do-able, overall an okay basic base recipe.

Have made thhese twice; once with blueberres and once with strawberries.  The strawberries were exceptionally good, and made wounderful muffins.  My bf doesn't like most fruit aside from strawberries.  He thought there were too many blueberries in in the muffins.  Come to think of it, he still ate 1/2 of them.  Can hardly wait until Peach seashon!

I thought that this was a very good recipe. I added a cup of strawberries with a cup of strawberry yogurt and a half cup of oatmeal. Instead of milk I used vanilla soy milk. It was a true hit!

these were okay... they were not like "WOW", but still fun to play with: I was looking for an easy, versatile recipe that I could use to make several different muffins: from one recipe i was able to make carrot muffins, apple-cinnamon, chocolate chocolate chip, banana coconut, and oatmeal raisin. that was pretty cool, but the overall plain muffin was just okay... dont know if i would try it again, maybe i'll use another muffin base. But, it was fun making all different kinds from just ONE recipe! Check for my picture!

Ok, the ONLY change I made to this recipe was that I added mini chocolate chips.  They were beautiful, had an amazing texture, but the only flavor came from the chocolate chips.  Definitely VERY bland.  But, because I liked the texture and look so much, I will try different variations.

These muffins have an appropriate name.  They are awesome all-purpose muffins and it's fun to think of new ways to make them.  Once I just added mashed bananas, and another time I added chopped, frozen cherries, chocolate chips and some almond flavoring.  They are perfect.

these were the first muffins i ever baked and they turned out pretty good. i didn't exactly stick to the recipe since i only made 6(so i kind of guessed the 1/2 egg and i think i put in a little bit more than that) and i also used soy milk and put fresh raspberries in each muffin. It was definitely a good taste- not too sweet!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I love to make muffins and this is a great base recipe for whatever I need.  I made my first batch with a frozen berry blend and really enjoyed it.  I am excited to use this with a savory recipe as well.  I will be putting this into my collection.

This was a really good recipe.  I added chocolate chips, coconut, and some nuts it turned out well.  I ran out of regular flour and used whole wheat flour and it was still very good.  Great base recipe.

Very good muffins! I didn't have anything to add to the base except for some cinnamon and they were still fantastic!

I used this recipe to use up some gooseberries and although I thought the muffins were rather tasty (especially when still warm) they were a bit thicker & more bready than I expected. Still a good basis, though, and I may try them again with some other fruits.

I've used this recipe twice now, and both times my muffins have come out perfectly.  I added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips and 2 small mashed bananas the the first batch, and I added a loose handful of chopped strawberries and a handful of blueberries to the second.

Excellent recipe! I made the blueberry variation and it was fantastic. I plan on making chocolate chip muffins and I thought I would try shredded carrots and see how well they will turn out. Thank you!

Pretty good. Mine were a bit tough, though. Maybe I overcooked them? Or I possibly stirred the dough too much. Oh well, either way, my family enjoyed them. I'm sure I'll try this recipe again soon!

These are a great starter muffin.  Sooo versatile and They come out very moist and fluffy. The Cinnamon/sugar are my favorite.  Hubby really enjoys chocolate chip and chocolate chip w/ strawberries (just thinly sliced frozen strawberries into muffins).  Can't wait to try  other variations.  Thanks

Oh my gosh! These muffins are delicious! They are so fluffy! I used melted shortening in place of vegetable oil, and I sprayed the muffin cups with butter-flavored cooking spray instead of using paper cups. The muffins are great, and I will definitely make them again!

These muffins turned out very good! I made 9 chocolate chip muffins and 3 cranberry muffins with raw sugar on top. They look very impressive and are super easy to make! Plus, no special trip to the store to get the ingredients, I have everything I need already in my home. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made these with 2 cups of stone ground wheat flour, a little wheat germ, 2 TBS oil and 1/4 cup sugar.  Healthy and good.
I also did another batch with 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour, then ground up some walnuts/chopped them and added them ot the dry ingredients with some brown sugar and then once I had the muffins in their tins I piped soe nutella into the center of each one.  SO GOOD and EVERYONE loved them.

I'm going to try these again because my turned out pretty tough. Instead of using vegatable oil, I used apple sauce because I didn't have any apples! I'll try this again.

Huh, these came out very dry. I did substitue 1 cup whole wheat flour and used Splenda for half of the sugar, so maybe that made the difference. I also added some vanilla, cinnamon, about 1/2 cup of frozen blueberrieis, and some lemon zest, but even with the additions they were a bit bland. Oh, and I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on the tops. They did puff up to a nice muffin appearance, although I only got 7 good-sized muffins out of the recipe. This is a handy muffin recipe, as it is simple and uses ingredients that I always have on hand, so I will continue to try tweaking it until I get them right. And I like that it uses a full cup of milk. Am always trying to get milk into my kids. Next time I'll try adding more fruit--I think a few mashed bananas and some applesauce would moisten things up. Oh, just realized that I used nonfat milk--that might have added to the dryness as well. Will try milk with some fat in in next time!

I tried the bacon variation, and sadly, these muffins didn't turn out as I expected. They were cakey and too sweet for me; they overpowered the slightly smoky bacon I used.

These were really good.  The fist time I made them exactly as recipe says, and added a bit of rhubarb strawberry jam in the middle.  The second time I added a tsp of vanilla and halfed the sugar for brown sugar and added craisins, mmmm...They were only in the oven for 20 minutes both times.

Good, easy to make and adapt to your preferences.  I was surprised by the texture of the batter - it was closer to cookie dough.  I added 1tsp of cinnamon to the batter, and made 6 muffins filled with Nutella, and 6 peanut butter chocolate chip muffins.

I made these muffins with whole wheat flour instead and maybe that is the reason they were not THAT great. I also added blueberries. I found they were missing taste. But this is a very easy recipe and the texture is great (moist inside and crispy outside). I will try to adjust to give it more taste.

Great recipe.  We have some food allergies so we used Ener-G's egg replacer and Rice milk in place of cow's milk.  The blueberry muffins got rave reviews by everyone!!!  This is a keeper!

Made this one again for Teachers' Back to School breakfast tomorrow....added strawberries in one batch and blueberries in the other....:)  Great Recipe!

I love this recipe. It's not too sweet, not bland. The tops come out *perfect*. I like to add chocolate chips and white chocolate chips.

These were so extremely good! i recommend added blueberries to them if u want blueberry muffins, or add cranberries and orange juice to them if you want cranberry muffins (just estimate how much orange juice, i used about 1/3 cup). this is a perfect template for any muffin recipe.

I have been searching for the perfect muffin recipe, and this is it! I did make some healthy substitutions as follows: 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup unbleached flour for the all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup Splenda for the same amount of sugar, still using 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also used egg substitute, and light olive oil, (no olive taste that way) and added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla. I made the recipe with 1 cup frozen blueberries, and sprinkled the tops before baking with a cinnamon/sugar mix. (1/2 tsp to 1 tablespoon.)  They were very tasty, and my family devoured them!

A good basic recipe, but very bland as is.  Make sure to add seasonings with whatever your add-ins are.

A good starting point...I added 2 mashed bananas, 1t cinnamon, and 1t vanilla to make 24 mini muffins (for the kids).  There was leftover batter to which I added chopped pecans to make 5 regular muffins (for the adults).  My kids are already coming up with "add ins" for the next batch...

These were only ok. I liked that they were moist and easy to make, but I'll try something different next time due to the lack of flavor.  I added some vanilla and blueberries and  they were still too bland.

This recipe has made me a star at my husband's place of employment! I have made loads of different kinds of food for him to take in, but this is what they consistently request.  I usually make the cheddar cheese AND bacon muffins in the oversized muffin tins, which are a tremendous hit.  Only modification, of course, is to bake them longer.  Easy to make, they look spectacular, and are great food for on the go.

Great, Versatile Base Recipe!  The cooking time is too long though.  I cooked them for around 16-18 minutes, and they were golden brown.  I am adding this recipe to my recipe collection to make again!  Everyone gobbled them up!

Very good.  I seperated the batter into thirds and made banana nut, huckleberry, and strawberry jam muffins someone else had suggested. I also made streusel for the top.  Everybody really liked them and having a variety, without having to make 3 dozen muffins, was nice.

I use this as a base for my muffins, but I substitute a little more applesauce for the oil.  They turn out nicely even when I use all whole wheat flour.  They're good, but not great.

This is an excellent muffin recipe.  The only addition I make is a tsp. of vanilla and the baking time - it never takes 25 minutes for these muffins - 18 tops, sometimes 16.  I've put chocolate chips and walnuts in them.  They're wonderful.  Thanks for this recipe!

Great recipe! To counteract the large amount of sugar, I added 1 tsp vanilla and  1 tsp cinnamon which made them utterly delicious with just the right amount of sweetness. I tried many different batches: one with a banana and a cup of nuts, one with 1 1/2 cups of fresh blueberries, and another with a cup of chocolate chips. All of them were awesome.

Pretty Good. I would only give them 3 stars for taste and texture but 5 stars for speed and versatility. I mixed up the basic recipe and then divided it to make 6 chocolate chip muffins and 6 blackberry lemon muffins. Great for a quick weekend breakfast or an evening snack.

Maybe it should be cooked with a little less of salt (10 g per 12 servings would be fine). Otherwise, these muffins are supreme.

I think this is a pretty good base, but I did not think they had the "crown" that is the signature for a really good muffin. My baking powder was just purchased the day before, so I know it was fresh. The second time I made it I omitted the salt and that seemed to help some. I will keep playing with it until I get it perfect. A good base to go off of and very easy! Thanks!

These were good. I added fresh strawberrys, walnuts, cinnamon and nutmeg.They are light and fluffy and taste good. There is something missing though on what I added.. I think next time I'll add more cinnamon to give it more flavor.

I like the versatility of this recipe but think 3/4 cup of sugar made it way too sweet. I will try it again but reduce the sugar by maybe half. Other than being too sweet, good muffin!

I used whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cup of mixed berries.  The berries were frozen, so I defrosted them a bit before adding to the batter.  Very delicious!  I might use a bit less sugar than the recipe called for next time.

Very easy and very fast! I use apple sauce instead of oil and subtitute part of the white flour with whole wheat flour (about a third). I doesn't alter the taste and gives a healthier version.

Good base!  Altered flour to: 1 1/4 C. all purpose flour and 3/4 C. Whole Wheat Flour.  Added  1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, mixed berries and chocolate chips to mine.  Sprinkled tops with Wheat Germ for a crunchy topping and an added nutition boost.  Very good!

I baked this with my 22 month-old as part of our "KITCHEN EXPEDITION" and she loved the experience.

As we were cooking for a toddler, I've used 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 wholewheat flour - the texture came out as I'd expected but it wasn't too great.

We baked 2 batches - one with raisins/shredded carrots; and another with choc chips and mashed bananas and we liked the second one better.  Next time we'd try with less wholewheat and it'd probably taste less chewy....

I bake muffins at least once a week and I am so excited by this recipe. It is WONDERFUL! I totally agree that these muffins are what you make them. Of course they will be bland if you put nothing in them!! I tried the blueberry, white chocolate, cinnamon variation yesterday, and they are already gone! I'm going to try the apple one today. These muffins are definitely not dry. Do not overmix, the directions are very clear. The only change I made was I baked them at 350 degrees for 30 minutes (which is what I usually bake muffins at). Turned out perfect! Thank you for a very versatile recipe Lori.

My son had just picked some blackberries, and besides pie, wanted me to make some muffins.  I chose this recipe, added plenty of blackberries, and also added 2 diced peaches that were starting to get too ripe.  These muffins were outstanding, so needless to say they disappeared quickly in our house.  Thanks for the recipe - it's so versatile!

I thought these muffins were great with bananas and chocolate chips.  My only problem was that I could not get the muffins light and fluffy - by the time I get the dry ingrediants mixxed in completely I think the batter must be over-mixxed.  Fortunately my family doesn't mind a dense muffin, nor do my daughter's 12 year old friends who start salivating if they know I am baking these!!!!

These muffins were so easy to make. Great Recipe! Very delicious and moist. Even after a couple of days they still tasted great!
I added chocolate chips, next time I think I
l'll try blueberry's I'm sure they will be just as good.

Good, but not as sweet as I thought they would be.  The presentation is great though.  I used blueberries (about two cups).  I will try again and experiment with different ingredients.

These muffins were good. It is important you use the liners or your muffins will stick to the tin and burn (as my did). I even sprayed the muffin tins. I added apples, carrots, wheat bran, cinnamon, cocunut, and peacans to my batch. Yummy!

These were so easy to make and so yummy.  I made two batches and gave them to our new neighbors only leaving a few for us, and my husband wants me to make more.  Loved the suggestion of adding 1 cup blueberrys, 1 cup white chocolate chips, and 1t cinamon.  I didn't think I  would like it, but I ended up loving it.

I made these with cinnamon, white chocolate chips and blueberries, and they turned out AMAZING! I also sprinkled brown sugar on top for a nice crust. I've made them twice so far, both times they were absolutely delicious and the best I've ever had. Definitely make sure not to overmix though (just like the recipe states ^_^), or the texture will be more dense.... Thanks so much for this recipe!

Everyone was right - these are the best ever and so easy.  I had buttermilk in the refrigerator from a previous recipe so I used that instead of regular milk and it was great.  This is a no brainer delicious muffin recipe.

These are so good!  And easy, too.  I use 1 cup of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat, and cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup, and they are still nicely sweet.  I make these with blueberries and ginger powder...a nice combination.  May try them with chocolate chips next time!

This muffin recipe is pretty good. I added a cup of chocolate chips and they didn't turn out too sweet. I think I overmixed mine because the texture is light and fluffy; they are more dense.
Overall a good base recipe for muffins.

This was good,,,I liked the easiness of the recipe. I added apples, cinnamon and vanilla. My on problem was that the muffin stuck to the bottom of the paper liner....I don't know why. But, nonetheless. the muffins were great,,,spread some butter on them from right out of the oven,,,yum!!! My 7 1/2 month old daughter loved gumming them LOL

unfortunately my muffins burnt a little on the bottom.  I think I might have left them in the oven for too long. Although they were only in there for 15 min. at the most.  All in all with the bottoms taken off they were pretty good. I made them into milk chocolate chip muffins.

This was a good basic muffin recipe but nothing spectacular. I added 1 cup of chocolate chips to the batter which the adults and kids both enjoyed. They were a little dry after the first day but great warm out of the oven.

To me, this was an excellent basic muffin recipe. I added a heaping cup of chocolate chips to my batter, and they came out great! They were soft and moist, just the way I like my muffins. Throw in the fact that they're so fast and easy to make, and I don't think I could ask for a better and more versatile muffin recipe.

I added three fourths a cup of chocolate chips and used applesauce in place of oil.While these muffins are good, they were no where near the 'best'.  The texture was more like that of a cupcake. I may continue to use this recipe, but only untill I find something that better fits my taste.

These are great!  Added chocolate chips to mine, but about 1 1/2 cups instead of just 1 cup.  1 cup seemed too bare.  I should've kept a better eye on these, as they got a little dark, but they still got eaten right up!  Can't wait to try them with other add ins! Thanks for the great basic muffin recipe!

Very versatile recipe that my whole family loved. I divided the dough in half, added dried cranberries and orange extract to the one half, and grated sharp cheddar cheese to the other...so everyone was happy.

These are great muffins..I added chopped apple & cinnamon, but they're good plain as quickie dinner rolls.  Next time I might throw in some herbs and cheese.

These were pretty good.  I made them today with my 6 yr old and let him put whatever he wanted in his half.  He did milk chocolate chips with cinnamon in them and said they were really good. I did mine with frozen cranberries, pecans and a touch of almond extract.  I think my favorite part was being able to let my son have his own free reign on what he wanted to do.  Thanks for the great recipe and very cherished family time that I will always remember.

I love these muffins! I didn't add anything to the recipe and they were wonderful. I enjoy baking but nothing turns out right...these muffins came out perfect.
