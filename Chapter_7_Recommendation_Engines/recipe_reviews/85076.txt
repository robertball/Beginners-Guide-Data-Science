Wonderful crab cake. Not too salty or spicy.  They were so good we had a hard time getting them to the table before they were all eaten.

Not bad ... Never made crab cakes before, but these were pretty good.  I did need to add just a little more mayo to make the crab stick together a little better; also this didn't take the whole 10 mins under the broiler.

This crab cake recipe was easy, fast, and good.  ...But it didn't blow my socks off.  I substituted Old Bay for the McCormick seasoning, and they were a little salty for my taste.  I will definitely make it again, but next time, I'll use less.  Also, I agree that 10 minutes under the broiler is probably a bit too long.  I feel like the cakes, while they held together nicely and had a nicely browned exterior, were a little dry.

These were so awesome.  If you are looking for a recipe for non-greasy crab cakes that aren't loaded with fillers, this is it.  You have to be a bit gingerly when putting them together on the broiler pan, but they did stay together and turned out perfect.  They are pretty rich.  I could only eat one medium sized piece.  YUM YUM.

I needed a simple last minute crab cake recipe for some left over crabs we picked. I usually only go for the recipes with 5 stars the highest quantity of reviews.  Boy am I glad I decided to try this one anyway! I used Old Bay instead as my seafood seasoning.  DELISH! We loved this recipe and it will be used often.  As a Marylander I am proud to add this to my recipe box!

I enjoyed this recipe, had just the right amount of all ingredients.  I used fresh crab meat and it turned out  delicious.
