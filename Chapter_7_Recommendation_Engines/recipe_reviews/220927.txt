I make these and send them to my vegan son for birthdays and Christmas. He loves them. I use cashew butter and brown sugar as substitutes for the cashews and turbinado sugar.

Very Very bland, with a lot of texture. Why do vegan recipes always call for random ingredients? I would suggest either using sweetened coconut OR use 1/2 cup of white sugar. The sugar in this recipe is harder to find and raw, so it's not sweet at all. 
I will try them again substituting the sugar and also adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and review at that time as well.
