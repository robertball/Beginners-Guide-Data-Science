Awesome salad!!! But please, do not use the 2 tbsp. of butter to toast the nuts & noodles. It is completely unnecessary and simply adds fat and calories. If you have peanut oil, substitute it for the vegetable oil too. It has a more complementary flavor for this recipe. Also, this salad is really good without chicken as well. I served it as a side dish to roasted chicken instead of tossing the chicken in it. I used less of the dressing this way, which cut down on fat and calories too. Overall, great recipe!

Very good salad Xing Jin (cool name)!  I changed it up a bit but with really good results.  Instead of using bok choy, I used a package of pre-shredded cabbage, a handful of bean sprouts in place of the snow peas and slivered almonds instead of the sunflower seeds.  I added a splash of sesame oil to the dressing for extra flavor.  The dressing was really good.  I only used 1/4 cup of oil and that seemed ample enough.  Mine did get a little soggy after sitting a while so I suggest using the dressing over individual servings if you don't plan on eating it all in one sitting.  Will pass this one on.

WOW! This dish is delish! I needed it to be especially easy and quick, so I used fully cooked rotisserie chicken from my supermarket deli and cut it up while the noodles and nuts were cooking. Instead of a 1/4 Cup sugar, I only used 2 TBS. and it was just right. I also added about a cup of shredded coleslaw. Adding 1/4 Cup each of sesame and peanut oil, instead of 1/2 Cup vegetable oil, made the dressing very authentic. My husband loved it. I'll be making this again. Thanks! :)

This salad was unique and delicious! I didn't care for the bok choy idea, so I used shredded Nappa cabbage. Eliminated the melted butter and used 1t sesame oil for a more authentic taste. Yum! Thanks Xing Jin.

I just served this salad at a potluck and everyone loved it.  I substituted pre-shredded cabbage and carrots which made it faster and slivered almonds for the pine nuts (a little cheaper).  It was very crunchy and the dressing made it tangy!!

This is a delicious, more "authentic" ramen salad recipe. However, the flavors tend to weaken quickly, and it isn't nearly as tasty the next day. My solution? Eat it all and don't save the leftovers.

Soooo Tasty!  Uses a combination of napa and bokchoy for the greens and added packaged slivered carrots.  Reduced the oil to 1/4 cup for the six serving recipe and toasted the noodles without any butter.  Was wonderful and lower in fat.

This is soooo good!! My whole family loved it and my friend at work made me trade her lunches when I brought some in (She had Subway). I did use cabbage instead of bok choy, lessened the sugar a little and added a couple splashes of sesame oil for some extra flavor.

Great recipe! Makes a great lite dinner.  Also good for an outdoor get together.  THe bok choy was a nice change from a traditional chicken salad using lettuce.  I don't even think my husband realized that it was cabbage!  I used almonds instead of pine nuts...yum!

I made this recipe again, but this time I added 2 teaspoons of sesame oil.  The dressing was good before, but the sesame oil makes it great!    ================================== I made this recipe for a potluck and everyone enjoyed it.  Don't skip baking/roasting the noodles and nuts since that is what made the salad flavorful.  I would definitely make this again!

Great entree! I mixed in ramen noodle/seed mixture after adding the dressing. I don't think this is a salad that keeps well until serving (do not make ahead and refrigerate). I think the salad needs to be assembled (all parts can be ready to go) at the last minute and served crisp. Crisp is really important in this salad; otherwise it is kind of old-salad bar.

I (nervously) made this for lunch for a Japanese friend, and she absolutely LOVED it! I used sesame oil for the dressing as others suggested. It tasted wonderful! I also cut back on the sugar, but wish I hadn't. This is really REALLY good - and I think any salad leaves would work (like a lot of the other ingredients, bok choi is a little spendy).

This is my kind of recipe!  Crunchy and interesting!  I loved the combination of seeds, bok choy, chicken, noodles and pea pods.  I did find it difficult to shred or grate the bok choy, so I just cut it very thin with a sharp knife.  I also cut down on the oil and sugar a bit, but think I will try it full strength next time.  Served with rice it made a nice meal.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken.  So good!

This is an incredibly delicious salad and very healthy too, if you make a few modifications.  I don't toast the seeds and noodles in butter, and find them just as yummy. Plus, I replaced the bok choy with pre-bagged broccoli slaw.  It's delicious and so easy, I eat it for lunch every day!  My kids love it too, when I leave out the onions and pea pods.

This salad is always a favorite at pot luck parties! I always add lettuce to make it more of a "salad" and cut the oil in half to save calories. I saute the chicken in olive and sesame oil for flavor. And for the dressing I use olive oil instead of veg. oil. Yummy!

This recipe was FANTASTIC.  We cut the dressing in half and it still had tons of flavor.  We also substituted red leaf lettuce for the bak choy since we didn't have any on hand - worked wonderfully.

Yum!  We had this for dinner tonight.  I made it according to the recipe, except for the water chestnuts (didn't have any in the pantry, and didn't want to go to the store!) and used slivered almonds instead of the sunflower seeds and pine nuts (toasted w/o the butter).  I added the dressing right before serving, as one reviewer suggested, but I think I will add it earlier next time, and just toss the salad frequently so the dressing will permeate the greens (but will add the nuts and noodles right before serving to keep the "crunch".)  Thanks for the newest addition to the rotation!

Wonderful recipe!  I altered it by using one bag of cabbage cole slaw mix with carrots instead and substituted sliced almonds for the sunflowers and pine nuts.  Also used slivers of green pepper instead of snow peas. Will make this again and again.

This was great. I did this without the chicken and it worked fine. One important note though is to mash up the ramen fully--otherwise, you get large chunks that can hurt the teeth!

This was an awesome salad recipe!  I used  prepared salad lettuce (to make it easier) and it was great.  Loved the blend of flavors and the dressing is great on lots of other salads, etc.  Definitely a keeper.

I'm addicted. I would give it ten stars if I could.  I used  slivered almonds instead of pine nuts and didn't use the  snow peas, too expensive. I used  about two tablespoons sesame oil and the rest vegetable oil. The sesame oil really made  it good, don't skip it.  It was even better the second day, the flavors melded beautifully. I kept going to the refrigerator and taking a fork full the next morning , I must have done that 20  times.   I had more chicken so  used about two cups, but you  wouldn't even need the chicken. It is not overpowering with the soy sauce .  You gotta make this one, its a keeper.I don't know how some people could say it is bland

my oh my!  I had NO idea I would like uncooked bok choy so much! This recipe is just perfect as it stands (is that really me saying that?? lol) Toasting the noodles, sunflower seeds and pine nuts was inspired! I considered spraying them with butter flavored nonstick spray but didn't do it (this time). There are lots of variations that would be fine with this salad, using left over bbq pork, or sugar snap peas instead of the snow peas, adding a few bean sprouts, or some shredded carrot or as other reviewers have done substituting cabbage. I made sure to use fresh lemon in the dressing because it makes such a difference in the brightness of it. All I can say is YUM.  Now I'm wishing I would have doubled the recipe because they practically licked the bowl haha

Excellent recipe with a few changes!  I use shredded cabbage instead of the bok choy.  I use Oriental Ramen Noodles and then add the seasoning pack to the dressing, which gives it a wonderful flavor.  I  omit the pine nuts and use sliced almonds.  Today I threw in some roasted sesame seeds and it was fantastic.

DH doesn't normally like salads, so I made this one night while he was out and loved it! He had some for lunch the next day and actually called me at work to rave about it and move it to the top of the favorites list. We both agreed it is a wonderful meal served with some jasmine rice on the side. Thanks for a great recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a few changes to the original recipe.  I add two cups of cabbage, one less of bok choy and didn't add as much oil to the dressing.  I will use this over and over.  Thank you for this nice alternative to traditional salad.

I was nervous about using Bok Choy because I have never prepared anything with it before, but my husband and I thought this dish was FANTASTIC!  My kids were not quite as enthusiastic, but I will definitely be making this one again.

For the most part this went over well. The only criticism I have was that I personally feel there was a little too much dressing for the salad even though I added extra vegetables, a beautiful summer squash that I slivered and toasted for 3 minutes in the oven. If you eat it the first day and don't give the salad time to rest it will taste too much like the dressing. The overall flavor was pretty good. (I had some of this salad the second day and it was much better! the flavors seemed to be fully incorporated and it all came together. Even if it is hard, wait to eat this the second day!)

I've made this a few times now and really like it with my adjustments, which is just a matter of taste. Chow mein noodle crackers instead of ramen & butter, slivered almonds instead of sunflower seeds and pine nuts, romaine instead of bok choy. I also like to throw on some raw orange bell pepper. And I make the dressing with brown sugar, sesame oil in place of half the veg oil, and mandarin orange juice in place of lemon. Even better: throw some sesame seeds in there as well! Even made as is, I think this recipe is a keeper, though I'm happy with my adjustments now.

This stuff is awesome!  Rather than plain chicken I used some left over chicken breast from a Hawaiian Chicken recipe.  My suggestions:  Use marinated chicken - it just bumps the flavor a bit, double the chicken and just about everything else because this makes a ton of extra dressing.  The leftovers are a bit soggy, so if you want some left over, seperate some out and save some dressing for later.

This was a great recipe! I used some olive oil to toast the sesame seeds and noodles instead of the butter.  Also I had to use shredded napa cabbage because bok choy was not available at my local grocery store- it was great!!

I love this recipe!  I have made it with and without chicken.  To make it easier on myself, I used pre-packaged coleslaw mix.  I also decrease the amount of oil.  I alwasy get rave reviews every time I bring this to a get-together.

I left out some things I did not have available or didn't feel I needed: seeds, nuts, water chestnuts; and I decreased the oil and used part sesame oil.  Makes a great refreshing lunch for work.  I think it would be almost as good without the chicken, too.

Fabulous salad!  This was a huge hit at our house.  My husband absolutely loved it.  I do have to disagree, however, with the prep time of 15 minutes noted on the recipe.  It took closer to an hour to prepare.  I was horrified at the calorie content, too.  But still, a great recipe!!

i saw this recipe and i had to try it. although I didnt have all the ingredients on hand. So here are my modifications. I use red and green cabbage instead of bok choy. I also used frozen peas instead of pea pods. i seared my chicken with  little salt and pepper. I used lime juice instead of lemon. and I didn't ha no pine nuts or sunflower seed so i used lightly salted peanuts. i didn't have red wine vinegar so I just omitted it. Still turned out healthy and delicious. Happy fooding.

I really wanted to like this recipe and I can understand why the ratings are high.  My 9 yr old thought it was weird with the noodles, and I really was banking on him liking that, since he loves those nasty top ramen.

The salad dressing was good, but nothing spectacular.  My bf ended up eating it and liking it, but probably wouldn't make again.

Wonderfully filling salad.  I actually didn't use the dressing.  I simply bought asian dressing.  I was running late and just needed something fast.  Having never created a salad with mentioned veggies, I wasn't sure how it would be received.  My husband loved it and my 14 year old daughter too.  11 year old son, picky eater ate the peas.  4 year old found his way too.  It became a great flexible meal that could satisfy all.  I was worried they would not be full, but it was filling!  Next time I do it with the actual dressing suggested.

This is a weekly dinner item at our house with fights over who gets to take the leftovers for lunch the next day!  We skip the pine nuts & snow peas(too expensive), use Napa cabbage instead of bok choy, and sometimes use chicken and shrimp.  For the dressing we cut way back on the sugar to just a spoonful or 2 at the very most, but we also add some crunch peanut butter to make it kind of Thai-ish.  Delicious!!!

Fabulous, I don't add my noodle in the bowl. I use them as croutons so they stay crunchy.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I wish I could give a 3.5 stars, cause I think this was decent recipe, but not quite 4 stars.  I've made it 3 times, and each time I adjusted slightly to get it where I liked it.  Most notable change was adding a bit more vinegar to give it more twang.  I also chopped the bok choy instead of shredding it.

Wow!!!! what flavour with that dressing!!! Didn't change recipe except to add a little sesame oil to the dressing. First time I've used Bok Choy - interesting veggie... I think substituting bagged coleslaw is a disservice to this recipe.

This came out great...better than other Asian Chicken Noodle Salad recipes I've tried.  I didn't have any pine nuts and forgot to add the chestnuts...but will next time.  My wife gave it the thumbs up as well.

Wow! This salad is awesome. I had to substitute few things because of what I had on hand. I used baby greens and cabbage instead of bok choy. I left out the seeds, nuts and green onion. I added some onion powder to the dressing and used white vinegar instead of rice. Oh' abd I also added some julienne cucumber. Delish!

The first time I made this I used a food processor to cut the bok choy, big mistake since it made the salad all soggy. I gave the recipe a second chance and cut the bok choy by hand this time, and wow, so yummy. Worth a try if you like healthy and unique tasting food.

This is a great salad.  It's sweet, crunchy, and offers a wide variety of fresh vegetables in the mix.  This a salad that goes great as a side dish to any entree or alone in a bowl.  My wife and I have made the recipe with and without the chicken and preferred it without chicken as simply a side salad. We changed the recipe a little by decreasing the dressing by half (we noticed there was a lot of dressing pooled in the bottom of the bowl when fully prepared) and replaced pine nuts with slivered almonds (pine nuts are just so expensive).  We've shared this salad with family and everyone approved.  We will be adding it to our recipe box.

I don't like crunchy noodles and we don't need the butter so I cooked 2 pkgs. of Ramen noodles per pkg instructions (no seasoning pak)and drained them. Used 1/4 cup EVOO, 1/4 c. water in place of 1/2 c. veg. oil, 1T. Sesame oil, scant 1/4 c. sugar, 1/4 c. sliced almonds. I used leftover Rotisserie chicken. Tossed it all together and it was lovely. I'll make it again. Thank you so much for sharing this with us.

Next time I would double the amount of bok choy and reduce the amount of sugar.

Delicious! My husband loved it. A few changes: olive oil and splenda instead of veg oil and sugar. I added craisins for colour and more deliciousness.

Great recipe to play with!  I substituted baby spinach for the bok choy, and pumpkin seeds instead of pine nuts. I also added a tablespoon of sesame seeds to the nuts and 1 tsp of sesame seed oil to the dressing which I poured on the hot noodle mixture immediately after taking it from the oven.  I have also tried it with jumbo shrimp but like the chicken better.  It’s a meal in itself and a favorite in our house!  Thank you Xing Jin.

I used 5 cups of the traditional cabbage instead of the bok choy, 1/3 cup of each of the nuts and only 2 green onions.  I thought it would be too overwhelming to use all that was originally suggested.  But, the recipe turned out great, the dressing was easy and terrific.

A big hit at a pot-luck picnic.  Keep the oven
baked noodles and nuts separate from the
rest of the salad until ready to serve.
We substituted pumpkin seeds for the
sunflower seeds and bagged shredded
cabbage for the bok choy. It seemed like
there was way too much cabbage, so we
halved that and it worked fine.  A unique 
and yummy recipie.

I have been using this recipe since 2000. I often forward the link to friends and family who just love it.  I like to toss the seasoning packet from the ramen noodles in with the noodles, nuts and seeds after they brown.  This gives the flavor a little kick.

I added the spices from the Ichiban noodles to the dressing it added a bit of pizzazz, I made the rest of the salad as recipe stated, my hubby loved it and it was a hit with the girls at work at our Tasty Tuesday lunch we have every third  thursday of each month.

Fantastic!!!  I substitued slivered almonds for the pine nuts the second time I made it and it was equally delicious!!  Didn't change a thing otherwise.  I wasn't sure if I would like raw bok choy, but it was really really good in this recipe.

This recipe is very bland.  I also think it would be tastier with about half the amount of chicken.  I skipped the pine nuts and the water chestnuts (family doesn't care for those), but I am not sure those would have really that much flavor.  If you double the sauce (but keep the sugar the same), it will taste better I think.  Since it was so bland I actually ended up spooning some into a tortilla and adding a tiny bit of cheese- and made an Asian taco.  That worked pretty well.

Excellent! I did the chicken on the grill which made it taste even better. The dressing had quite a strong vinegar taste, so I added additional vegetable oil, soy sauce, a clove of fresh garlic, and about a teaspoon of freshly grated ginger. It was much better! I would agree with others to keep the dressing on the side and only add it when you are ready to eat the salad. I will definitely make this again. Very easy and tasty.

This is a fantastic salad!  I don't use all of the butter it calls for and my family loves the dressing so we always make a little extra-but if you really want to make this salad fabulous....add CRAISINS!

This is my new favorite salad meal!  I didn't have everything so had to do the followign changes - but we loved it!:   Slightly cooked broccoli and coli-flower instead of snap peas / shredded lettuce and carrots instead of bok choy / a little peanut oil and powdered GINGER!!  added to dressing  / white wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar.  I made it two weeks in a row. I will definitely make this for our next get together!

I recently made this for a friend who was restricting Vitamin K since she was on blood thinners.  Bok Choy and Pine Nuts both have a lot of Vitamin K so I made the following substitutions:  Slivered almonds instead of pine nuts Corn and bamboo shoots instead of bok choy  Also, other comments gave me these ideas for changes:  1/8 cup sesame oil and 1/8 cup peanut oil instead of 1/2 cup vegetable oil 2 tblspn sugar instead of 1/2 cup Put in more chicken than called for  It was a HIT and now I have to make it again for my husband!

Delicious even without the water chestnuts and snow peas, which I completely forgot to put in!  Lots of compliments. I did use cabbage instead and actually used 2X the amount. I think you need to let the dressing sit a little longer with the cabbage though to marinate it just a bit, maybe 10 min or so. I also halfed the oil and didn't use butter, as suggested by others. I also sauteed the cubed chicken in a marinade of veg. oil, soy sauce, fresh garlic, fresh ginger, honey and chayenne (I was out of crushed red pepper). It was a little more work but very tasty after added to the salad! Esp. the ginger, I thought, added some zing.

A friend made this and it was so yummy.  She gave me left overs I had the next day that were even better.  her changes: "When making dressing, add a touch garlic,mustard, salt,some sesame oil, honey, and thicken w/ almonds. Veggies- add shredded carrot,a little red oninon,cilantro? chopped bell peppers, chinese cabbage, radichio. Use buckwheat soba noodles-cook ahead-drain, use some sesame oil to keep them from sticking together."  subbed. in orange juice for lemon.

This was good last night when we made it, but it's SO much better today for lunch!  I didn't put the cruncy mixture in the salad, just sprinkled on top of each serving.  I'm not a huge fan of the bok choy so I'll probably try using romaine lettuce next time.

This meal was delicious!  This was the first time I had ever used Bok Choy and was surprised at how pleasant the flavor.  I ended up with too much dressing; I used a slotted spoon to dish it out so that the dressing wasn't overbearing.  I will definately add this recipe to my regular meals.

best salad ever. i made some adjustments though. in the dressing i used half the rice vinegar and i also used o.j instead of lemon. i used pumpkin seeds with the pine nuts cause that was all i had. i also seasoned the chicken with some dragon rub and cooked it fresh. you could get away with not using the noodles and using less sugar in the dressing. i also used bamboo shoots and sugar snap peas instead of snow peas. the flavors just went beautifully together. even my kids liked it!

I made my own version with baby corn, green beans and spinach.  The sauce had a lot of sugar in it so I used agave nectar instead.  It got great reviews from my guests.  Next time I will try to find a healthier replacement for the ramon noodles.

This was a hit with 4 teens and one old guy.  :)  I did not use the butter for the nuts and noodles.  Had made some of the dressing early and marinated the chicken in it before cooking.  Tossed the noodles and nuts with the leftover marinade and then baked for 10 minutes.  Did not have bok choy so I used 1/2 cabbage and 1/2 lettuce.  Since we had 4 differet dinner times tonight, just added the dressing and the nuts/noodle mix to each plate as I dished them up.  Everyone loved it.  One 16 year old son suggested leaving out the chicken next time but he did like it as made.

Great salad! Ramen noodles and nuts give it perfect amount of crunch- they're almost good enough to eat on their own as a crunchy snack. My husband liked it as well as my 2 and 3 year-old. They actually cleaned out their plates!

It was ggod - but not great.  I think it needed a bit more greenery to match up with the other ingredients - it seemed like all nuts and grains and not enough salad to me.

Very good.  I thought I had pine nuts, but didn't - tasted good anyway and pine nuts are so expensive, I'll probably leave it out next time, too.  I used the bagged, shredded cabbage as some suggested, though I used an extra cup and tossed in some bagged shredded carrots for color.  I used the ginger soy sauce.  Great summer recipe.  Thank you, Xing Jin.

Wonderful!! I am vegetarian so I substituted fake chicken for the real thing. I also had a bag of shredded carrots that I needed to get rid of so I added those. Absolutely delicious.

I made this salad for the family and we all loved it!  I left the dressing on the side so that the leftover salad would keep for another day.  Very yummy!

This was a great salad!  We left out the chicken and didn't put the sugar in the dressing.  We found it didn't need the sugar at all- the soy sauce cut down the tartness just fine.  We also put the dressing on as each person wanted it.  We have plenty of dressing left over and will make less next time.

The salad dressing is so delicious and so easy to make! I didn't use the pine nuts and used slivered almonds instead. Might want to add mandarin oranges next time!  A great salad, and very versatile, I think you could add or subtract ingredients and have a great salad!

I have made other versions of this salad before and all are similar.  I liked the sunflower addition in this one.  However I didn't feel the dressing had much flavor.

Really good!  I subbed almonds for pine nuts to save $$$, used poached chicken breast and left out the water chestnuts...also did a mix of cabbage and baby bok choy- delish!  Not the quickest salad to mix up, but worth the time!

Very tasty - was a hit with my 16 month old and 3 year old even.  Just dry toasted the seeds and noodles without the butter.  Put lime juice instead of lemon juice as I had the bottled stuff.  Other than that, stuck to the recipe and enjoyed it.

This was a delicious, easy salad. I had it for lunch today. I subbed two cups of spinach for bok choy using only 1 cup of bok choy, added green peppers and left out the snow peas and water chestnuts as I was out. I also didnt want to waste the seasoning that came with the noodles so I mixed it with the melted butter and poured over the noodles. I will definately make this again!!!!

AMAZING is the only thing I have to say to this. I made it following the recipe exactly and it is the best salad I've ever made. (it also introduced me to water chestnuts, which have become a favourite ingredient of mine)
I would try following the recipe the first time you make it, and decide any modifications you want to make after you've tried it. I read through most of the reviews, and I still think the original recipe is best.
The only complaint I have is that it takes a lot longer to prepare than it says. A quick and easy meal this is not. (though the work is worth it!)

Served this at a Super Bowl party and EVERYONE loved it. The only thing I did different was no water chestnuts since the store ran out. Thanks for such a great variation to Chinese Salad

This was delicious!  I used cabbage instead of bok choy, and since I am vegetarian, I also skipped the chicken and added garbanzo beans (chickpeas) for some protein.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Now, right after I made it, I could not stop eating it.  The next day it was quite soggy. Someone else mentioned maybe putting the dressing on individual servings instead of mixing into the whole salad -- I would definitely recommend this if you aren't going to eat the whole salad at once. I can't wait to make it again!

This is a GREAT salad!
Not too heavy.  I did everything exactly as the recipe stated, but I cut the sugar just a bit -- we prefer our asian salads not quite as sweet as most.  I think next time I will add another cup or two of the cabbage -- It helps even out the taste with all the nuts etc.

Great taste! Needs more bok choy, try 6 cups instead. Otherwise perfect.
