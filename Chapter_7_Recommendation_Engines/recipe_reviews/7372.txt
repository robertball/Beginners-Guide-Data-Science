I thought this was a good cake but I think the directions lack a lot.  After reading the other reviews I didn't think I'd had much trouble making this cake.  But there were a few things I would have appreciated knowing.  When making the filling make sure that the flour mixture cools completely.  I did not and my filling was very thin.  I put it in the freezer for about 45 minutes and it thickened up a bit.  Also after layering the cake with the filling if your cake seems to look like the layers will slip apart put wooden skewers in the cake and cut off the top of them (you'll frost over them and then find them as you cut the cake - they're easy to find as long as you're not cutting huge pieces).  With the icing make sure that you beat it well (after cooking it) so it gets thick.  I put the icing in a bowl after it boiled for a minute and beat it with my electric hand mixer for about 5 -10 minutes.  It's a great icing.  I had to spread it on the sides a bit but you have to be quick because it gets hard.

I had very high expectations after reading the reviews but found it not worth the effort. For some reason the sugar never really dissolved for the fudge sauce so it was grainy other than that it turned out exactly like it should have.  I used recipe to the letter and thought filling amount was fine.  I used 2 8" pans they cut great. It was attractive and tasted okay but again not worth the effort.

I made this cake today and it is very good and rich.  The filling kind of reminds you of a hostess cupcake, which I love.  They are my favorite junk food.  Next time I make it I am going to use 8 inch pans instead of 9 inch pans.  Since the recipe calls for you to cut the cakes in half, they were kind of thin to be cut in half.  Also the filling was very generous for those thin layers.  I think it would be better if the cakes were thicker, and this would also make the whole cake taller, which would'nt hurt.  Also, I used real butter in the cake.  But when it came time to make the icing, I was out of real butter, so I had to use margarine, and I did'nt read the recipe good enough when it says to let the icing boil a minute without stirring.  I was stirring away.  Anyway, because I stirred too much or because I used margarine versus butter, the icing did'nt get thick enough.  Learn from my mistake.  It did get thick, just not thick like a hostess cupcake.  When I poured and drizzled it should have been thick enough to stop at the bottom of the cake plate, but some of it ran off.  Kind of made a mess, but it sure tasted great!!  This one is a keeper!!!   Aunt Pitter Pat from PB

Mmm!  Followed advice of others and only made 1/2 of the filling which was a perfect amount.  Did it in 2-9" pans and next time plan to make it in 2-8" pans as others suggested.  The 9" layers were almost too delicate (thin) to handle after splitting them; plus, I like a higher cake. Still a wonderful recipe, though!  If you have more time, make the cake from scratch for a truly "homemade" taste.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday.  He said it was O.K.  I didn't quite like this recipe.  I was hoping that the filling would be creamier and not harden up so much after being refridgerated.  The chocolate sauce didn't cover the cake as much as I hoped it would.

I was hesitant to make this cake after I read on some other reviews that it tasted like a some giant mass produced cupcake ding dong thing that you could find at a drugstore because I really wanted a cake that would be impressive. Yes, it does taste similar to those little hostess cakes but this cake tastes better. The chocolate glaze on the outside makes it look like the whole cake has been dipped in chocolate. Its great for writing on with the cream frosting(because there will be alot left over), but candles with cause the outer chocolate layer to crack and look less impressive. Once you've had a bite, you won't want to stop eating it.

20 years ago a coworker made and shared a cake similar to this, I have been looking for the recipe ever since.

I have 6 - 12 teenagers to lunch once a week and they are brutally honest about what I serve. They loved the cake and started in on it before the icing had even set

This was probably the best chocolate cake we have tried in quite some time.  I did, however, bake it in three 8" pans (to save myself from trying to cut the layers).  Admittedly the filling was very thick, but it was great anyways!  I will also look for an alternate frosting.

"Awesome cake mom, make this again!"  I used 2 cakes mixes and doubled the filling and icing which was not necessary.  One very important hint, make sure the flour/milk mixture is COOL or you will not be able to make peaks in the filling.  Also, the chocolate frosting part does take a while to thicken and does not get very thick... it all tastes great though!

Filling was a little tricky.  The chocolate sauce topping is a keeper...we love it as sauce over cake as well as a hot fudge topping for ice cream!  Delicious!

Wow! LOVE this cake!! I thought there was a perfect amount of filling for nice thick layers between the cakes. I did add a little extra vanilla in the filling. Thank you so much for sharing this one!!

This cake is not only great tasting, it is great looking. Everyone loves this cake. Just be careful you don't cook the frosting too long because last time it did not cascade down like the cake like it was supposed to. But it still tasted great. Thanks

This was a very good cake! I think I would cut the filling in half though. It was a little too thick for in between the layers. I will make this again with that one change!

This was a wonderful cake.  I followed the recipe exactly, using a Betty Crocker Devil's Food Cake mix, but I did use a different chocolate icing.  It was a HUGE hit for Father's Day, both with my husband and his teenage son, who's not normally a fan of chocolate cake.  I will definitely make this again.

Sweet fancy Moses!  This was an incredible cake.  I made it last night and we all loved it.  My brother in law said it was "possibly the best chocolate cake he has ever eaten."  I agree!  I used a Betty Crocker chocolate fudge box mix for the cake and sliced one layer in half and left the other one whole-so I had two layers of the yummy white filling.  This cake was so good and I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe-I will enjoy this one many times over again.

WOW!  I made this cake last night using Duncan Hines Devil's Food cake, and it tastes just like a HUGE Hostess Ding-Dong!  I followed the instructions to a T and the ganache and filling came out perfectly.  Great Recipe!

The rating is for the sausy stuff. It was great, considering it is mostly butter and such, I was dissapointed that most of the ingredients were topping and not the cake itself. Next time I will be making it with a cake from scratch. otherwise it was good

I have made this cake for company and showers many times.  I love how impressive it looks with relatively little effort.  Just follow Joyce's directions, and you will have the best chocolate cake you've ever had.

I'm really sorry to give this two stars.  The filling was not tasty.  I think next time I'm craving a layered fudge cake I'm going to just make a chocolate cake with my own frosting recipe.  I'm still looking for a good filling to put inside.

Wow considering that I didn't have any butter when I made this and had to use all margarine, this turned out fantastic! When I made the filling i knew the margarine would never form peaks so i didn't even bother for the flour/milk mixture to cool properly..It didn't even matter.  I got it on there and my family said it was one of the best cakes they have ever had.  The chocolate frosting was very good, and really added a lot to it.  I didn't have enough cocoa powder so I just stuck in a square of semisweetened chocolate and it still turned out fine.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

I served this cake to my husband for his birthday and he and all our guests raved about it.  It is very good and yes, it does remind you  of a Hostess cake.  I took another user's advice and used  8" cake pans and it turned out great and was a very attractive cake.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! This cake is wonderful! I made it for my Nana's birthday this weekend and everyone was really impressed. Of course, I didn't follow the directions and cool the cake and the filling, so it wasn't as pretty as it could have been, but we did not care. My mom and Nana said that the fudge sauce was just like the one my Nana used to make when my mom was little but much easier to make. They both went home with the recipe in their pockets. Thanks Joyce!

This recipe is great - even better when made with "from scratch" chocolate cake

I have made this cake alot of times and its very good but my family loves it when I make them cupcakes. They are better then any store bought cupcake! When you make this cake or cupcakes make sure the flour mixture is room temp. I usually make this mixture and then the cake. So the are cooled at the same time.

Awesome cake recipe.  I followed the recipe as written. I baked the cake for my daughter Ella's fifth birthday.  I did let the cake come to room temperature before serving to let the glaze and filling soften a bit.  Everyone had 2 slices, even my "I'm not a chocolate guy", brother.
