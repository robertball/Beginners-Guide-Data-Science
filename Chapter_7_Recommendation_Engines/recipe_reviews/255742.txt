I added extra cocoa and cinnamon sugar. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. There was no difference in this recipe and previous recipe for fried chicken tenders I have in the past. Donâ€™t get me wrong! They were good just not special .

I was skeptical of this but I am here to tell you that these turned out excellent! The breading came out super fluffy and had a restaurant quality look to it. Very impressive! I used chicken breast tenderloins to make it easier on myself (no cutting required) and I also used my deep fryer to make it easier on myself too. These were excellent as is but while eating them I had a thought. If you were to use peanut oil instead you might end up with a more Chick-fil-a taste. I'm not sure but it is just a thought.
