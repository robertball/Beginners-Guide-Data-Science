OMG! I love apples and cheese, but never would have thought of the two in a sandwich! This was a great for lunch. I used whole wheat bread and and a Granny Smith Apple. I also subbed some mild cheddar cheese as I thought it would pair better than American. This is definitely a case of don't knock it 'til ya try it!

Very yummy! I used wheat bread, instead of white, and Tillamook Cheddar cheese rather than American. Totally hit the spot...with some added nutrition! I know what I am putting in my kids lunches tomorrow!

What a surprise!  This was really good.  We did need to add another slice of cheese to "sandwich" the apple slices inside.  I will make this again & again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My kids thought this was great. I used whole wheat bread, a large organic Granny Smith apple and sharp cheddar cheese. As soon as I served up the sandwiches, I swear they were gone. Then, they wanted two more!

Wasn't terrible, but really nothing extrodinary.  I love all the individual components (apples & cinn./grilled cheese)  but together wasn't a masterpiece.  I'd prefer a traditional grilled cheese sandwich with cut up apples on the side for lunch.

I really didn't think this would be good but it was delicious! My only suggestion would be to make the apple slices very thin so they don't fall out as your flipping the sandwhich. Personally..I loved this! Thank you!

This was very good!  I didn't add the full amount of cinnamon but wish I had.  I put two slices of cheese on the bread as suggested by a previous reviewer but I think it would have been better with one.  Will definitely make this again!

This was quite tasty.  I used provolone cheese and a red apple. My husband remarked that it almost tasted like an apple fritter and next time wants to add bacon.

To be good grilled cheese has to be toasted on all 4 sides.   I hink the additions are wonderful I have added thin sliced ham for years.   I like all cheeses that melt good.   The addition of bacon and apples sound wonderful.   Since I toast on the inside sometimes I heat the ham a little.   Also real butter is the only thing that toasts a grilled cheese like we like it.   There are wonderful ideas here that's what  I enjoy about this site I can use parts of 4 or 5 recipes and come up with the ultimate end product.   Thanks for sharing your delicious ideas. ACE

I used whole wheat bread for this sandwich.  I loved the apple and cinnamon touch to an ordinary grilled cheese sandwich!

hmmm...it's different. Not bad, but I only took a couple of bites and my son only had one. We just weren't too fond of this combo. Sorry, it wasn't for us.

This was pretty good.  It was a slightly different take on the typical and I enjoyed it.

Apples and cheese go nicely together as a snack so why not in a sandwich? I really enjoyed this and would never have thought of it. I've always used 2 slices of cheese when making grilled cheese so I did no different this time.  Thanks for posting this!

I was looking for something easy, quick and just a little bit different for lunch, and this sandwich hit the mark.  It was a nice twist on a grilled cheese.

This was good. I used 2 slices of cheese so that the apple slices were in between each slice of cheese. Used Land O Lakes cinnamon sugar butter.

Well, that was good! Cheese goes good with apple pie, so why not apples with grilled cheese? I didn't have any American cheese (I live in Canada), so I subbed old cheddar. Next time I might try gouda. The cinnamon was a nice surprise in a grilled cheese recipe - I used freshly ground Mexican canela entera. And I didn't peel the apple. I really enjoyed this sandwich. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great tasting sandwich!!  A delicious change from the plain grilled cheese.  Slice the apple very thin and cook on low heat -- I used hoop cheedar slices.  Delicious.
