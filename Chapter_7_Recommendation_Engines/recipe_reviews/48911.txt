Very nice & simple recipe for "kielbasa biala" (white sausage). I usually do two little things in addition:
- add a bit of marjoram (personal preference)
- let sausage rest overnight in the fridge before boiling (to let flavors mix)

Always include Marjoram spice, along with lots of fresh, crushed black pepper.  When hand mixing you should SEE the Marjoram flakes as well as the black pepper.  After stuffing into casings, prick a couple holes every foot or so with a tooth pick.  This alows the trapped air to escape.

Thanks this is as close to my dziadzia's as I can get. I know he always added marjoram and more garlic. I will be trying this one for Thanksgiving.

Nice...but I like a little more bite to mine. When you prick the sausages, it also stops them from turning darker quicker. There is a sausage pricker you can buy, which sausage makers use to do this. Polish sausage to me has lots of pepper and garlic for flavor. In my sausage, I don't like it too salty, so I usually use 4 tsp per 5 lb. About  a tbsp and a half of black pepper, and half a tsp of white pepper. 6 to 8 cloves of garlic. 2 tsp of marjoram. I usually grind this into a powder at this point. I have a coffee grinder I use. Then I add about a tbsp of mustard seeds.
