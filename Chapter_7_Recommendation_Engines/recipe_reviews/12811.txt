This is by far one of the best scallop recipes I have ever tried.  It was so easy to do and taste great!

4.22.18  We know that we also eat with our eyes and, visually, this dish was not appealing, simply anemic looking, unfortunately.  Taste was pretty good,  but I think this would greatly  benefit from the addition of some snow peas or some thinly-sliced red bell pepper, anything to give it a pop of color.  Followed the recipe except for using fresh ginger root (just because I had it on hand) instead of ginger powder.  I  used small bay scallops instead of large sea scallops and served over basmati rice.  Certainly was super easy to make, and Iâ€™m going to give it one more try adding some additional vibrant/colorful veggies.
