I suggest watching the video. I'm surprised there aren't more reviews on this one. :) My slight changes were: I added the honey to the yeast/water mix, and added the salt in lastly while adding in flour to make a soft dough. Also used salted butter, didn't seem to make a diff. Only thing is, if you get 3 dozen rolls their going to be pretty small. I got 18 and they weren't that big. 1.5 oz or so each. Seemed I needed to add in more flour at the end then called for but I did use bread flour instead of A/P. However, the end result turned out fantastic. I used my 10" round Superstone (for deep dish pizza) to bake them and 15 rolls fit perfectly. Nice fluffy rolls. I will stress DO NOT sub dry for fresh Rosemary. You will probably leave a bad review if you do that but it will be your fault (just saying). Thanks CJ. My go to roll recipe here on out. :) Man, so simple yet delicious.

I searched and searched for a dinner roll recipe that was easy and sounded  good to make for Thanksgiving. I went with this recipe because it came with a video, which I suggest watching if you've never made homemade rolls before.  I made a test batch today to taste them and this recipe is a keeper. They are very good and the rosemary added a great flavor that wasn't over powering. This is my first time ever at making homemade bread and I am no Betty Crocker in the kitchen. These rolls were easy to make. I followed the directions completely. It seemed I did use a little more flour then called for. I just added very small amounts until the dough balled up and pulled away from the sides of the bowl like in the video. Be sure to have a thermometer on hand so you can get the proper water temperature so not to kill the yeast.

Super easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I made half the batch as per CJ, putting them close together on a baking sheet to "pull apart" and the other half in muffin tins.  Both were equally good and presentation wise, both pretty.  This is going to be my go to recipe for dinner rolls and substitute herbs to along with my menus.  Also, I made the lemon herb butter on this site and the two were great compliments to one another!

I prepared these rolls on short notice and despite not giving them the proper time to rise, they still turned out wonderful. My wife wasn't a huge fan of the rosemary, but I thought the light hint of it added to the flavor in a great way. Delicious!

Let me first start out by saying that Chef John is the bomb!  I discovered him when I tried his meatless meatballs and anyone who can conquer something like that was worth following.  In the past I have not had good luck with dinner rolls, they were either too heavy, didn't rise, or didn't have good flavor.  These rolls were beyond amazing.  I couldn't believe the flavor that came from these.  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I instead used 1tsp of dried rosemary and doubled the honey.  I thought it was going to be a flop because I needed much more flour to get the dough to pull away from the bowl, but I was patient and it worked.  I strongly suggest following the video instead of the instructions.  They are slightly different, and the video will keep you on point (as well as make you laugh)!  These were easy, and worth the effort!!!

I've been following Chef John on Youtube for years, everything I've made has turned out pretty awesome. This recipe is no exception. Yum Yum.
One thing I will say is I only got 24 small rolls, any smaller might have been a little ridiculous. 
I made the rolls to act as burger buns and my burger became tiny sliders.

These were awesome! I used a stand mixer because I'm useless at kneading by hand. I made them for Thanksgiving, but the grocery stores were sold out of fresh rosemary by the time I was able to go shopping. Instead, I crumbled up some dried rosemary and mixed it with the milk and butter while it was heating on the stove so it'd rehydrate. It really incorporated the rosemary flavor throughout the bread. I think I'd do this even with fresh rosemary. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I was only able to get 18 very small rolls out of this recipe, so I would definitely at least double this recipe for a crowd. I'd love to try this with whole wheat flour.

I made these using 23 grams as the size of my rolls, and that produced 30 luscious rolls!  Thanks so much for another great recipe, Chef John!  The people at my dinner party thought they were great!

I had a little problem with the yeast and my mixer so i told myself i wasn't going to be making this again any time soon. But when i started baking, the aroma alone was so rewarding! And 'as always' with all Chef John's recipes i have tried, it turned out perfect! My husband says thank you, Chef John. Now i am sure i am going to be making this every weekend.
Of course, i didn't even attempt to make any changes to a 'Chef John's recipe'. I only used my favourite herb instead of rosemary. I only know its local name here (i am in Ghana, West Africa) so i might just post a picture of it later to see if anybody can help me with the name.

I have made these several times now and everyone loves them.  This recipes makes a large batch and more than we can eat, but these freeze well.  I wrap in foil and reheat.  The smell of them baking is wonderful.  Enjoy!

If you're not experienced with making bread, remember:
1.  The amount of flour you need will depend on the type of flower, the particular wheat (or other) used to make that flour, the amount of humidity in the air, the time of year you are making it, the temperature in your kitchen, etc., etc.  In other words, it will vary from one time to another, even if you use exactly the same brand of flour.   So follow the video - use only 75% of the flour called for at first and then just add about a half cup at a time until the dough just pulls away from the bowl.
2.  Always add a small spoon of sugar to your yeast when you start to 'proof' the yeast.  (Proofing is testing the yeast to make sure it's alive.)   Yeast 'eats' that sugar and begins producing carbon dioxide.  This produces that foamy look that you want to see.
3.  Follow the chef's recommendations in the video for ensuring even roll size.   It makes it all very simple.

Yum!  I love Chef John recipes, and this one certainly doesn't disappoint.  I made a chicken stew and needed an easy dinner roll recipe to go with it.  You need to plan ahead for these since they take about 3 hours with all the waiting, but they are incredibly easy and really tasty.  Don't change a thing in the recipe.

A minor fault in this recipe is that to start the yeast you will need to add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar to the warm water otherwise this is a fantastic recipe and the texture of the rolls is perfect.

I just made this recipe and they turned out pretty perfect. I made the mistake of forgetting to punch down the down after the first rise, so i had some surface bubbles on the roll. But regardless they turned out surprisingly well especially considering how simple they are to make. I doubled the size of the rolls and they baked in my oven and were done in about 15 minutes. Instead of using rosemary, I substituted poppy seeds  as a garnish because I didn't have any fresh herbs on hand. All in all it is a fantastic recipe, even for beginners

I followed the recipe except used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour. I ended up with 18 usual sized rolls. They were a good side and impressive coming out of the oven.

I tried this recipe, and it turned out great. I had to put a little more flour than what the recipe called for, but otherwise everything was as simple as chef John showed us. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious buns made special with the rosemary.  Did mine by hand rather than machine.  Used 25% whole wheat flour in a separate batch - very nice flavour.

I've made this recipe several times now (thank you, holidays, for providing ample practice). They turned out wonderful exactly as written! Just make sure you use enough flour- this step is so dependent on your kitchen conditions.  The dough really does need to pull away cleanly from the bowl if you want to end up with the beautifully domed dinner roll tops. 

I did tinker after the first couple of times, making 24 rolls instead of 36- it's all personal preference but I found the rolls were on the very small side when I made 36. 24 was perfect (about the diameter of an English muffin diagonally, corner to corner).

As stated in the description, it's easy to change these up too. I added two eggs and doubled the butter and the result was a heavier bread with flatter tops. They've been perfect for making ham and egg sandwiches with Christmas dinner leftovers. 

This latest time I added one egg and an extra cup of flour. I think these were my favorite. Super light and fluffy, but noticeably "heavier" than the original.

I have made this recipe countless times. They turn out perfect every single time. I usually don't add the rosemary when I am doing it through out the year. I feel like it fits with more foods that way. I have also tried making it with half whole wheat flour and half white, and they still turn out awesome. My kids absolutely love these (without the rosemary), and will eat the whole batch in one meal if they were allowed.

First of all thank you Chef John for all your great recipes they never disappoint. These rolls were very easy and really delicious...I read  reviews that mentioned a video but there was no video on the All Recipe app so I looked it up on YouTube, I'm glad I did. I'm a beginner baker and needed to actually see what the dough should look like. Like other reviewers I too had to add way more flour than what the recipe called for so it was nice to be able to see the video to have a reference. just a heads up if it looks like the dough isn't coming together just add more flour a tablespoon at a time and be patient and it will work out. I Will definitely make these rolls again in fact there's no stopping me now, I'm going to try Chef Johns sandwich rolls next!!

These were AMAZING!  The only changes I made was to add the honey into the water/yeast mixture, the salt in with the flour and I made the rolls bigger than Chef John.  Making them again, I would probably reduce the rosemary from 2 tsp to 1 tsp.  They were wonderfully fragrant and full of flavour but the rosemary was a little over powering.

These rolls were delicious!  I first made these for Thanksgiving 2015. The recipe produced 24 rolls, that seemed small at first - even after shaping and  2nd rise - but the oven spring was amazing!  I gave the oven a healthy spritz of water just before adding the rolls and then after 2 minutes of baking.   Soft, light, buttery and super easy.  Needless to saw our family devoured all 24 and the next day I had to make another batch because everyone wanted fresh rolls for leftover mini-turkey sandwiches.

These were excellent! 2 things that I did differently was one I didn't add the rosemary and they still were good and 2 I should have added the full two tablespoons of honey instead of just one. They're a little small but it makes more than enough for a family of 6 to 10 people to have more than two rolls each. Will be making again soon.

These were so tasty!  I served them at a wine and cheese night and they were amazing with garlic butter and blue cheese.  I followed the recipe but ended up needing quite a bit more flour- maybe up to half a cup!  I also mixed and kneaded the dough by hand and they turned out great.  Next time I think I would add a bit more Rosemary and experiment with adding things like parsley, sun dried tomatoes, or bacon bits!

These are great rolls.  Very soft and fresh!  I made the dough in my bread machine and then made them into rolls and let raise for the second time.  Made the work so easy.  Next time I will add a little more rosemary because I love the flavor and wasn't quite enough for me.  Great recipe though!!

Update: March 2016: Watched the video this time and used 4 cups of flour and they were just perfect


March 2105: Let me start by saying I have never made bread before and the thought of it has always been rather intimidating. These were so easy to make and very tasty. I was hosting a chili competition and I really wanted to try my hand at making dinner rolls.  WATCH THE VIDEO FIRST! I didnt watch the video and so I had to go back and a fix my batter when it was too sticky but they still turned out great. I needed at least double the amounnt of flour

Did not use a stand mixer. Used a chopstick to gradually blend wet ingredients into dry ingredients..starting with milk mixture, then yeast mixture. Remember to ensure the wet ingredients are not hot enough to kill yeast..Used regular butter and skipped the addition of salt. Added extra flour until a pretty workable dough formed..a little more than the extra 1/2 cup of flour the recipe called for. Kneaded for a couple minutes.  Skipped the egg, and brushed melted butter mixed with garlic powder mixed with chopped cilantro (or any addition of choice) . Could cut the dough into balls and stack them a centimeter apart or bake as a whole, whatever you choose. Baked at 350 until golden brown at edges (or however you like). Take out and brush another layer of butter. Let cool before serving. Results were fantastic! Thanks soo much for the recipe!

I served these yesterday at Christmas dinner to our grown kids & young grandkids.  Everyone knew I prepared the dinner, which was yummy.  After dinner, my daughter said she couldn't get over how good those rosemary rolls I served were -- talking as if I had ordered them from a bakery.  It turns out my DIL also figured they came from a bakery.  When I told them "NO, I baked them," they were blown away.  MANY thanks to Chef John for this great recipe.  So...  I'll be making them often this year and sharing them with family and friends.

I didn't tweak anything.  Perfect as is.  I added the very final additions of flour very little at a time (less than 1 Tbsp at a time at the end).  Finally I found the point where the dough didn't stick to sides or bottom of the bowl.  Voila.  Just follow the recipe.  You'll be happy you did.

Made this for thanksgiving and was a great side. Small size was perfect and were fluffy on the inside. You can taste the rosemary but its not too overpowering. It seemed stronger tasting the day after. For kids I might reduce the herb and add parmesan.
|| 
Recipe was easy since the mixer does the work. I ended up adding maybe 1/2 c more flour but turned out well.  My trick (learned from SmittenKitchen.com) for portioning rolls is to take advantage of the uniform round shape after the first rise. Don't punch it down but flip it onto a cutting board then cut it like like a pie. First down the middle, then quartered and so on. The number of cuts makes this technique a bit harder but its still doable and easier to portion in my opinion.

Okay so they are amazingly delicious, so why only 4 stars? As written they wouldn't come out, they needed a lot more flour, about 3 cups+ instead of 2 1/2 cups+. Maybe it has to do with the flour I was using but who knows. And please, ONLY use fresh rosemary before giving a bad review, you really need the fresh stuff! It's so good!! Thanks Chef John!

I just took these out of the oven and there are already three gone! the only thing I changed was adding about a teaspoon of lemon zest to the dough and sprinkled a little extra flour over the top before I baked them. Mmmmm! Thanks Chef John!

These are delicious! I made these to take to a pasta pot luck dinner for my daughter's high school swim team last night, and they were the first to go of all of the bread choices. I followed the recipe, except that I just pulled small amounts of dough off, forming and panning them as I went. I got 20 medium sized rolls from one batch. I've added this recipe to my Thanksgiving menu this year. Love the rosemary flavor!

I only get 23 or so smallish rolls with this recipe. It only uses 2 1/2 cups flour so I’m not sure how you can expect a whole lot more. Very tasty. Extras freeze & reheat just fine. If I’m going to the trouble to buy & chop fresh rosemary I’m definitely using more than 2 tsp, used closer to 1 1/2 TBS total. I sprinkled some on top with the salt.

Even though I adjusted the last half a cup of flour to a full cup i am still giving this recipe a 5 because it had such a strong finish all in all! Im not a fan of rosemary so naturally i didnt have it on hand and it was not included in my bake. Just at that extra 1/2c of flour at the end and you should be golden. I used my stand mixer and dough hook. I did not make 36, they would need to be pretty dang small for that. I ended up with 24 and they were perfect. 18 minutes in my oven, not 20. I'll add garlic salt to the top next time. Not just salt :)
Thank you Chef John

Beautiful and tasty.  Soft interior with just hard enough exterior.  I made the dough in a bread machine and used the microwave instead of the stove top. Plan to make again for Thanksgiving.  Don't skip the egg wash - it is essential to their lovely appearance.

I hate to rate having never made these, but I think I would like to make them for Thanksgiving this year.  I won't have time to start from scratch on the day, so I'm wondering if I can make ahead and freeze and/or refrigerate prior to the final bake?  Any suggestions?  I'm not  a baker (in case my dumb question didn't make that obvious).

For a dinner roll this had surprising good taste and texture.  The one thing we added after baking was additional honey with butter on the rolls which actually worked very well with the salt covering on the rollsl.  My grandkids who are very picky eaters loved it as well with the honey on it.

Made on a snow day, and was disappointed in the results. Everything seemed to go along fine, and it wasn't bad, but my bread loving family didn't love this one. I made like the recipe, except added 1 tsp sugar to yeast, and added a bit of garlic powder to top it at the end because I love garlic and rosemary. The rolls were puffy, but full of air and the texture was just off. I'm not sure if it was me or the recipe. I will likely try it again as I have high hopes...

These rolls are so incredibly good. Only thing I did differently is I didn't have rosemary so I used a dried Italian seasoning, and sesame seeds on top.

I made these for Christmas dinner in 2017 and made a double batch. I did use salted butter and had to add a lot more flour until it wasn’t quite so sticky. Fresh rosemary is a must in these turned out wonderful and I got a lot of compliments.

I made these for a Christmas party yesterday and everyone loved them.  It was my first time making them.   I watched the video and then made the recipe as directed.  They were delicious and the first to go of the three rolls I made.  I have already had friends ask for the recipe.  I will definitely be making these again.

i was uncertain on the amount of flour to add after the initial 2 cups. i added the 1/2 cup but the ought was still very wet.
They taste delicious and are light but didn't rise much perhaps my yeast was too old.

This recipe seems to be pretty forgiving. I forgot to brush egg before baking, and it still taste great. Ended up making eight Sandwich buns out of it instead of dinner rolls. Used my bread machine to make the dough. Or use the measurements provided, and  did end up adding another tablespoon of flour to bring it all together during kneading.

These rolls were OK, but I think I would have liked them more if they were bigger (make 18 instead of 36) and add a little more honey--they were a bit sour tasting.

Made these tonight! So Good!! I think mine needed a bit more time to rise the second time; the rolls were super tiny! I also used more rosemary, because I had some extra, which I really liked! Will indeed make these again.

i made this recipe and they didnt turn out that good. i think its because there are no sugars in the yeast water substance which can throw it off.

I made these today because I saw them in the AR magazine. I have been searching for a "go-to" dinner roll recipe for a while now and this is it. I didn't have any fresh or dried rosemary so used dried Herbes de Provence that I had in cabinet and topped with Maldon sea salt flakes that I just received from KAF.  I used bread flour and baked 20 minutes. The crust was slightly crunchy and the crumb had the perfect texture! I made some Make Ahead rolls from Food Network website for thanksgiving dinner a few weeks ago and the texture was like muffins. Very disappointed. I should have gone to AR website. I don't remember a time when an AR's recipe let me down.

I followed the directions.  I didn't like the texture of the bread.  Dry and stiff.  Edible but I'm disappointed and won't try this recipe again.  Glad I didn't make it for company.

These are excellent! I added an add'l tbs of butter to the dough before letting it rise. Next time, I will add more sea salt and rosemary. I used dried rosemary, so I halved the amount to account for that, but I prefer a more pronounced rosemary flavor. These take some time, as so most breads, but they are tasty!

Well, i must confess i ve just learnt our house has a kitchen!! 
So ya, i did go and find all ingredients and try this one out. You make it look super easy (must be for most people), and i braved it. But my rolls were very hard on the outside. Any idea why that is? I am keen to learn, so please feel free to tell me what ALL you think i could ve messed up!!
thanks!

I have never made bread before, but the video made it seem so easy that I had to try! It was delicious- I halfed the recipe but my  roommates ate it so quickly that I wish I had made the full batch. 
Using the same ingredients to make more tomorrow!

I only made half the recipe using some whole wheat and some all purpose white flour and  dried rosemary. I made and kneaded the dough by hand.This made 18 small, delicious, irresistible dinner rolls. We had them  with beef stew.
I will add more rosemary next time, the flavor of it was barely noticeable. Also, it only took 15 minutes to golden brown in the oven.

Really easy and yummy, too. My family scarfed down about 8 of them before I could even snap the picture. We LOVE rosemary around here, so next time we'll double the amount. I also added an extra egg and an extra shot of honey.

I used two tsp dry rosemary and soaked it in hot water to rehydrate them
I also added an egg to make it richer and added more flour to form a dough ball
My whole family loves these rolls!

I tried this to substitute for my normal crescent rolls for Easter dinner. Half the group thought they were great, better than the crescents, very redolent of rosemary. The other half, including me, preferred the regular crescents, finding these dry, needing salt, and just not tasty. I will not save the recipe.

This was great! My daughter even passed on the extra mashed potatoes (her fav) to have more of these! I put a little too much sea salt on the top, but the rest was bang on. These will definitely get a special place in my recipe book.

Made it for thanksgiving and they were amazing-no substitutions. Well I did add the honey with the warm water to activate the yeast rather than after, but I consider that more of a personal technique not an alteration of the recipe.

With the video these were super easy to make. I ended up needing to add some floud after rising when I went to knead and portion the rolls. I ended up with 32 rolls. Maybe they were a little small but no one complained. I'm always looking for ways to use my rosemary bush!

Great recipe, and the video is really helpful. I did have to add rather a lot more flour than called for to get the correct texture, but the rolls turned out fabulously.

I made these yesterday for our Thanksgiving dinner. I followed the directions exactly but I omitted the rosemary only because my turkey was heavily herbed and didn't want overkill. I used "best for bread" flour and not AP as noted in the recipe. I need way more flour...like almost a cup more. I did just like the video said and add gradually, stop and scrape...it just wouldn't pull from the sides. It was still pretty sticky when done but I oiled it and let it rise. I was a little concerned but it rose fine.  It was still super tacky when I laid it out to cut to make the little balls...we just floured our hands. The buns turned out great though! Fluffy and light. Next time I will make them bigger though for sure.

I'm always on the search for new roll recipes, and man these ones were good. These rolls partnered with beef stew were a match made in yummy food heaven. I highly suggest these rolls with hardy meals, it complemented it perfectly. Will be saving this recipe, and using it again.. Very soon :)

I made these rolls last night and baked them this morning.I divided the dough into two equal parts.Each dough yielded 20 small rolls(pingpong ball size)I put blue cheese in the other half and plain rolls for the other half because my husband doesn't like blue cheese and I love it.Also I used a cup of whole wheat flour and a cup of bread flour and added vital gluten.The dough rose high first but after I shaped the rolls, and let them rest overnight, they flattened and didn't rise even after baking.Yet they were delicious but a little dense.I will make them again but I will add eggs to add more protein.Thank you Chep John...Neri Kawashima Kawasaki City ,Japan

Followed it all exactly. I was really impressed with how the dough turned out. It was the perfect amount of flour. I was just mixing everything in a bowl by hand, and it came together so easily, and rose beautifully. The rolls weren't mind blowingly amazing, but they were still good and I might try them again, doubling the recipe and making bigger sized rolls.

This recipe came out great the first time.  The video is easy to follow and makes home made rolls easy.  Any Chef John recipe is a keeper.
