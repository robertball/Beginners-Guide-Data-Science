Although preparing the grapes was time-intensive, this can't be avoided, and it was definitely worth it.  This is SO delicious.  I didn't have enough grapes for a whole pie, so I rolled the dough and cut it into small circles.  I used these in a cupcake tin to make open topped-tarts.  The 12 of them lasted about 1/2 hour once they cooled!

I didn't have Concord grapes, but a very large container of dark seedless grapes that my DH bought at our warehouse club. There were more than we could east so I decided to make this pie.  I cut each grape in half lengthwise and squeezed them as hard as I could into the pan, skins included.  Then I followed the recipe as provided.  The pie turned out delicious!  I was surprised at the flavoring as it had almost a rhubarb hint.  I had never heard of grape pie previously, but now I have a new recipe in my book!

This pie was superb.  I was nervous about eating a pie made out of grapes...but I was pleasantly suprised.  It was tart like a rhubarb pie. Loved it.

I found a shortcut that saved me a lot of time: I did not prepeel or individually separate the seeds.  Instead I put the entire bunch of whole grapes into the pan and mashed down on them some and turned on the heat.  I stirred in part of the sugar to bring out the juices and cooked down the grapes.  Between the sugar, continuing to mash the grapes, and cooking down, it released most of the liquid.  Furthermore, by not removing the skins the color of the grapes were brought out without having the skins in the pie.  I then strained everything through a strainer (leaving behind seeds and skin) and added the remainder of the sugar to taste.

I made the filling into prepared tart shells instead of a pie and the flavour was wonderful. I am withholding one star because of preparation- separating the grapes and skins is time consuming and I became VERY frustrated separating the pulp from the seeds. I might have had exceptionally seedy grapes, but I was ready to give up when my husband suggested putting the pulp/seed mix into the lettuce spinner. Two rounds of that separated everything and I continued with the recipe. 

So- fantastic result but some frustration getting there.

I can not tell you how many times I made this pie, and everytime I did everyone loved it!  The removing of the seeds is a little time consuming, but you would have to do that no matter what.  I would definitely reccommend this recipe!

I made this with grapes I acquired from a local winery. (acquired - haha!) and it was amazing...  Watch your pie crust so you don't over bake it, will try this next time with a scratch pie crust and see if I like it even better...

There is a "Grape Jamboree" near the town I grew up in that sold grape everything, including concord grape pie.  I LOVE IT! This recipe is far from difficult and really, no more time consuming that an apple pie. I did add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious!  It has the wonderful sweet/tart similar to a strawberry rhubarb pie.  I thought it was a snap to prepare.

Very good reciepe, unfortunatly living on the north west coast real concord grapes are not easy to come by here. I had to use seedless concords, and these are rare here as well. If Id had the grapes from Naples NY where Im from this would have been perfect. Thanks for the reciepe

This pie was great! I used black seedless grapes, halved them and cooked on the stove top for 10 minutes. Super easy and delicious! I'm going to try green grapes next time!

Good pie! I mashed all the grapes and then picked out the skins.  It was still a lot of work but it seemed easier then separating the grapes one-by-one. I won't be making this very often, as it took my quite some time.  A nice tasting pie in the end!

When working with grapes, an alternative is to boil them with 1/4 cup of water (stems included).  When soft, mash with potato masher (gets the stems separated).  Remove the stems with tongs.  Then strain or process through a food mill.  

I personally think this is less frustrating than removing the grapes invidivually from the stems/skins. 

I freeze pie fillings as I make them in the summer, then defrost in the winter when we're ready to make a pie.  Great contribution when travelling for a holiday; take filling from freezer to car, put in fridge when you get there.  Frozen pie crust travels well or can be purchased upon arrival.

Another great idea for your harvest is Concord Grape Sorbet.  Stores great in freezer, reprocess with blender a day before you want to serve.  Makes a stellar contribution when you are a dinner guest!

Last summer I was lamenting that one could not buy Concord Grapes it seemed, my favorite from my childhood. Literally the next day on Craigslist a man was offering a couple of boxes from his garden, he just couldn't use them. I had never made Concord Grape Pie before, but CG's + pie = how could it go wrong? I ended up making four using this recipe, and sharing them. SOOOO GOOOD. A little time consuming to remove skins and seeds, but if you are a Concord fan, it is worth it. The only change I made was I use Tapioca in my pies instead of flour...Try this!

I had a good size package of large seedless purple snacking grapes that were getting old so I quartered them and added sugar and a little grape juice (out of lemon) and hey, it turned out okay. I probably won't make it again, but for the record it wasn't bad.

I followed this recipe to a "t". I found it was way too sour. It was quite time consuming and messy. I made sure that I  put the pie on a cookie sheet first and I'm glad I did. The filling ran out all over the place. The smell was amazing, but the taste just didn't cut it!!!

Definitely a lot of work to make, but it had a very welcome and unexpected flavor. It feels like eating cherry pie, but has the nice tang of strawberry-rhubarb. It is heartburn-inducing, so take it easy on the eatin'.

This is a "wowzer"! Flavor knocked us over! So delicious and unexpected. Don't shy away from this because you have to separate the skins--it is so worth the effort! I use both hands to move things along. I do a lattice crust, and the gorgeous color of the grapes bubbling out all over the top makes it look as fabulous as it tastes! My compliments to the chef!

I don't think it's the recipe's fault, but this pie was not loved.  the skins add flavor and color but are not fun to chew on.  The pie is pretty sour.  It also takes a TON of time (took me 1.5 hrs) to get the seeds out (I didn't have cheese cloth).  If I make another grape pie, I'll definitely mix it with something else (apple?) to tone down the flavor.

Wow, never heard of a grape pie. My daughter had picked a bunch of Concord grapes, on a trail close to our house, and said she wanted to make a grape pie. What the heck, lets check allrecipes.com. This recipe was fairly simple, and really delicious. About the same as rhubarb on the tartness scale

We love this pie.  I do it a little differently.  After preparing the pulp, I add to the skins, then run it thru the food processor to chop up the skins some.  I also add a cup of chopped walnuts.    It is a very delicious pie.

Loved this!!! I bought concord grapes by mistake forgetting they had seeds, so I looked up a recipe for grape pie. While it was a bit of a pain to get the seeds out , and I probably won't buy concord grapes again, this was a terrific way to use the grapes we had. My hubby loved it too, and he's hard to please!!!

I really did not like this pie.  It smelled & looked wonderful, but the flavor was just too much, and could have used a lot more flavoring.  I made extra pie filling and used some of it combined with extra sugar and fresh pears to make a crisp and it was divine.  So 3 stars for the base of a lovely recipe, but not actually for the pie!

I made this because someone gave me a basket of concord grapes and I didn't want them to go to waste. I followed this recipe exactly never having even tasted grape pie before. It was a little bit of a pain but I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I couldn't wait to try it so I cut into it too early I think because it oozed out but still was really good.

4 cups of grapes does NOT fill a pyrex 9" pie crusted plate. I also felt the amount of sugar was somewhat too much for the 4 cups of grapes, but my grapes may have been a little bit towards older, so they may have been sweeter. Other than the fact that it was a smaller pie than I was expecting and sweeter than I would've liked (but I could've tasted it before just stirring in the entirety of the dry ingredients) it was very good! I didn't notice any weird texture from grape skins. I did end up with a few seeds, probably because when I was squeezing the grapes I didn't check if any seeds accidentally got left in the skins.
