Raising Cain's dipping sauce is just like this! This is great on chicken and French fries. A splash of vinegar makes it a bit more tangy.

Oh my, just really liked this sauce.  Have seen Zaxby's restaurants in both Florida and Georgia but have never eaten there, so I don't really know whether or not  this is close to their sauce.  We had this with some breaded chicken fingers, and I will say that we devoured it. I can see this on a good old grilled hamburger, as well.  And it just doesn't get much easier to mix up than this.  Franny, thanks for sharing your recipe.

Yeah, That's pretty darn good. One thing though. Everybody says Zax sauce or Zaxby's sauce, but Zaxby;s actually copied it from Guthries. In fact, they even copied their main deal.  Chicken, fries and a piece of toast. That was Guthries, before Zaxby's was even created. Now I don't know if Guthries stole it from somebody else, but they had it before Zaxby's

Excellent recipe and very close to Raising Cane's sauce, if you would like to make it a little spicier and more like Zaxby's sauce I would swap out the mayo with horseradish sauce.

Yummy!  Love Zaxby's, love this sauce!   All four picky kids devoured it with Parmesean chicken strips.   Easy to make and easy to love!  The "ready" time is wrong.   This takes two minutes to whisk up. Great quick dipping sauce.

This is quick and easy to make.  My son said its not exactly like Zaxbys but it is still really good. This is also makes a great dipping sauce for fries.

My husband fixed this for a snack with chicken finger. It was very mild flavored. A good 4 star sauce, but we like bold flavors. After talking it over we're going to use it as a base and add horseradish, or chipotle and just have fun with it. Thanks for sharing.

I have never tried the zaxby's sauce, but we enjoyed something different to try with our chicken tenders and fries. I followed recipe as written and let it sit for 2 hours.

Great dip! My 10 year old asks for this all the time and my in-laws always take the leftovers home for their sandwiches. We not only like it with chicken but love it on our rosemary/olive oil baked fries!

Pretty good, found another recipe exactly like this except it adds 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice and 1 1/2 teaspoons molasses and it made it a little better. Still tastes a bit like it's missing something, but a good substitute for the real thing. Though, I personally prefer to make things myself so I know exactly what's in it. Also, step 3 is very important, it's definitely better after it's sat in the fridge for a while.

I added a little onion powder, tumeric and paprika to make it more sour and tangy since the catsup makes it on the sweet side.  I find Zax sauce is more salty and tangy than sweet

Never had Zaxby's sauce, but I like Cain's. This was similar but lacked oomph. I added a healthy sprinkling of colatura de alici ( a salty extract of anchovy) since Worcestershire sauce seemed to be the ingredient that gave this sauce the most interesting flavor. So much better, both more savory and complex! I will definitely make this again.

Solid dipping sauce.  Not bad!  I've never had Zaxby's, but I have had Cane's.  Very similar to Cane's dipping sauce - not the same.  This sauce might have a little more tang and less spice than Cane's.  It was great though!  Worked for the chicken tenders I made.  Will keep and make it again no doubt.  :)

My 10-year-old granddaughter loves Zaxby's chicken fingers but, more importantly, the "Zax Sauce".  Unfortunately, I live no where near one of the restaurants so I used this recipe to give her the sauce to dip her chicken tenders in.  She loved it & said "Papa, you got it just right".  Therefore, as far as I'm concerned, this is the real deal.

I have never been to the restaurant. I was just looking for a different dipping sauce for vegetarian chicken nuggets. It was definitely okay, but I think it would be better on a sandwich than nuggets. Not sure how it would be on French fries I’ll keep looking for a new dipping sauce.

This is a very good base! I liked the recipe as written quite a lot. However, the second (and third and fourth and fifth, etc) times I made it I added a splash of vinegar, some paprika, and some cayenne pepper and I liked it a little better. It's closer to Zaxby's with the extra zing.

Pretty good! It would be better if I hadn't gone into it with Zax sauce expectations.  I didn't do the measurements exactly right, I didn't let it chill, I added vinegar, practically doubled the pepper, and ended up with too much Worcestershire sauce.  In comparison it doesn't taste exactly the same, but by itself it is a formidable sauce!

This didn't taste like Zaxby's Sauce (in my opinion), but I don't even care!  This sauce is delish and versatile.  Thank you!

I was a little skeptical at first if I was going to like the sauce just by reading the ingredients but I absolutely love it! I grilled up some chicken and used this sauce to dip it.  I want to try the sauce with shrimp next! This sauce sort of reminds me of Chipotle mayo. Yummy!!

I made this, but I would alter the ingredients as to our cultural likings. This recipe is a winner otherwise, my friends really dug into it! I myself enjoyed it too, thank you for it.

Very good.  I thought this  was identical to the Zax sauce! I did make one mistake: used garlic salt instead of garlic powder.  Made it way too salty!  Ate it anyway, just had to to go easy.  I'm wondering if  this would work with greek yogurt in place of the mayo?  I think I will give that a try.
