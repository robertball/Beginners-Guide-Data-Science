I thought I liked spinach, but the taste is pretty overwhelming in this recipe.  If you really love the taste and flavor of spinach, you should like this.

This was a huge hit at my house on Christmas Day.  With two of our 6 attendee's being vegetarian it was a life saver... very quick & easy to make and absolutely scrumptious.  I was a little worried by the review which claimed the recipe had a strong spinach but was pleasantly suprised.  The salsa idea is terrific, I use a medium-hot salsa for an extra kick. I must admit the recipe said to 'rain' the spinach and I wasn't sure whether this was a spelling error (meaning 'drain') or whether I was meant to wash the spinach under running water and squeeze dry, I opted for the later and was everybody was totally impressed and elighted that there were second helpings.

I was pleasantly surprised when my husband liked this.  He loves spinach, so I tried it.  He said it tastes like a vegetarian lasagne!  I'll definitely make it again.  I did not really taste the salsa though.  Might want to do the add it on the side.

As a new vegetarian, I'm always looking for good main dish recipes. My husband, also newly vegetarian, and I both really liked this! I used hot salsa and I also added some black olives. I thought the flavors blended very nicely. It's also very easy and doesn't require a ton of clean-up. Plus, it's filling and makes great leftovers! I'll recommend this one to friends.

My husband and I both enjoyed this...not so my 14 yo son...oh well no accounting for taste.  However I did modify the recipe to lower the fat:  using part-skim ricotta and 2% mozzarella.  Next time I'll try substituting the light cream for ½ and ½ cream.  I think the additional salsa to pour over the wedges counters any "strong" spinach taste. Great meatless meal!

I thought this was really good, cheap and easy!! My hubby loved it too. I did add a bit of crushed garlic and a sprinkling of cumin to the mix. I also didn't have ricotta on hand, so I substitued cottage cheese...still turned out well.

The filling was OK the day that we made it, but was delicious as a leftover. We will make it again, but I will make the filling the night before to let the flavors blend together.

The tortillas became very, very soggy and slimy during the cooking process. The spinach filling, however, was yummy and might work well with lasagna noodles and such.

This was fairly easy to make and quite tasty.  M husband really enjoyed it.  My only problems were that (1) it was FAR more filling than I had expected, so I had lots of leftovers, and (2) it became rather soggy after being stored in the fridge.  It maintained its tastiness, however.

I didn't find that the spinach flavor in this was to strong. There was hardly any flavor at all, bland and boring. It might be better with hot salsa but I didn't like it enough to even bother trying again.

Very quick, easy and tasty. I used fat free ricotta and fat free mozzarella. Surprisingly, it was very good, even with the fat free ingredients. The cream adds some fat, so next time I am going to try using milk in place of cream. I don't think the cream added much to the pie. Yummy!
