I used a mixture of butter and EVOO to brown the meat in and I used beef stew meat instead of round steak only because it was cheaper. Because I used stew meat, I simmered this longer than the recipe asked for......over an hour. I didn't really time it, I just simmered it until the liquid in the pan reduced by half. I also added 8 ounces of sliced fresh mushrooms to stretch the meal a little. This would have been really good BUT I think there was too much wine and I think it needs more spices. The meat was perfectly tender, the sauce was thickened and looked beautiful and it turned out like it should.........I'd like to try this again but cut the wine in half and maybe add more spices. Maybe basil and oregano? Maybe a bay leaf too?

Was hesitant about trying a recipe that wasn't rated but decided to make it anyway.  No one in my family liked it.  The beef was too tough, maybe with a different type of beef it would be better.

This recipe Is my go-to stroganoff recipe. It's so delicious that I make it when friends and family come over and they end up begging me to make it again next time. So good, so tasty (and how)!

Great recipe!  I used sirloin, cabernet and light sour creambecause that is what I had on hand.  Plus the ever present "better than boullion" beef base that I always have on hand.  I added about a half cup of water and covered the pan for the 45 minute simmer just to make sure it didn't dry out.  Added a bit of kosher salt at the end.   End result was velvety smooth and rich!
Shockingly enough my two kids (age 11 and 8) also loved it and I did not have to pull out the emergency chicken nuggets for them!  :)

Don't  use cheap meat - period!  You can't use stew meat.  Use good round or even sirloin cut THIN.  Try it without the thyme and burgundy, adding lots of portabella mushrooms for a different taste treat.  I add more beef stock than the recipe calls for and instead of flour I prefer thickening at the end of cooking with a little corn starch mixed in water, before stirring in the sour cream.

I love this recipe.  Of course, I had to modify it.  I used a Cabernet and not burgundy. I also used pre-cut beef stew meat. And instead of beef broth, I used bouillon cubes. I basically eye-balled this one and didn't follow the measurements exactly. Super-tasty.  Just like my Mom's.

The meat was tough and the sauce wasn't quite what I was expecting.  Keep looking.

I mean, I didn't measure much and I'm sure I went off the recipe but that's not important. I wanted a noodley, beefy, wine-infused savory dish, and this was fantastic. I viewed other stroganoff recipes before this one, but I wasn't looking for easy, I wanted taste. And this delivered.

Tastes much better than it looks!! It was pretty good. I added mushrooms as well thankfully gave it a little extra flavor, it was kind of on the bland side in my opinion which I tackled with some salt. Felt like it was missing something though... Anyway I'd make it again! Definitely go with the better cut of meat too, it wasn't tough at all.

I made this with chicken instead of beef and it was so good. I made a few subs tho. I used Cab instead of Burgundy wine and olive oil instead of butter. I only used half of the recommended flour and added 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic.

This recipe is amazing. I added a little more broth and wine and used New York strip sliced thin instead and added a little red pepper and garlic and salt. Also 1/4 cup more sour cream, but this is an absolute must have recipe. I made this a few years ago but was excited to find this recipe! Thanks for sharing!!

Following the recipe and only adding pepper and salt, we still found this to be a little lacking in flavor.  I cooked it in a crock pot for several hours so the flavors should have been well blended.  I think it can be amped up a little more by adding a few more things like a bit more thyme, salt, pepper, and a few other spices that go well in a stroganoff.

Loved this recipe, however, I did change it due to missing ingredients. I coated the beef (round roast beef chunks) with salt, pepper, and flour, then browned in a frying pan. I omitted the wine (must have drunk it up last weekend) and added just a little more broth, and added some fresh sliced mushrooms. It did simmer for at least an hour.  I added a few cut up carrots to the noodle water for color and health.

While delicious, this finished dish was not at all what I expected. My own fault, I usually do a better job of reading through and thinking through a recipe before I begin. It's clear that this is less a stroganoff with a splash of burgundy and more an attempting to marry your boeuf bourguignon and your beef stroganoff. To that end, the dish is a success. A few adjustments: I used a thin cut sirloin and butter; sautéed onions and mushrooms BEFORE adding the beef; simmered the broth, paste, Shiraz (in place of burgundy), and thyme together before adding to the beef & veggies. Also used double the flour and the broth mixture (broth, Shiraz, thyme, paste). The original amounts just didn't seem to be enough to sustain the 45-minute simmer without complete reduction and potential burning. Even after doubling I still added 2 cups of water. It just looked entirely too thick to "simmer" that long. Could explain why some reviewers ended up with tough or dry beef.  With the noted adjustments, definitely a dish I'd make again; just not when I'm in the mood for stroganoff, lol.

I used cubed venison loins soaked in water for 3 days. Changed water daily. Used butter instead of margarine. Added a can of mushrooms with the onions.  Used Cabernet wine and a whole 14.5 ounce can of chicken broth (no beef broth in the house). I didn't have any tomato paste so added a can of stewed tomatoes drained and about 2 Tbsp of ketchup. Still tasted bland so added a little soy sauce and tsp of spicy brown mustard. Had great flavor and was very smooth. I loved the sauce and the venison didn't taste gamey.

This was great! I did substitute the margarine with real butter. I really like the burgundy twist with the classic stroganoff recipe!

Main modification was using a Pinot Noir and I used a little more beef broth and water to thin the sauce while simmering. I added about a teaspoon of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomato paste which seemed to mellow the bite from the paste. I will def make this again and simmer for the full time. Meat was a little tough because didn't simmer long enough but certainly was tasty and didn't affect my opinion of the recipe. Next time I will added mushrooms and prob use a fuller bodied red wine maybe a Cabarnet. I hope you enjoy it as well!

Very good!   We didn't have the four hours a lot of the other recipes called for.   We found this ti be quite tasty, and will be preparing it on camping trips some time.   (Ok, yes, we eat really well on camping trips).

Just an absolutely great recipe. Thanks! I followed the recipe for the most part - but I used Stip Loin as that's what I had on hand. So tender and so tasty! Next time I'll be adding small button mushrooms.
