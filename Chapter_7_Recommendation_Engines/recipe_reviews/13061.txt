I decided while cooking this that I'd tweak a few things to both add flavor and make it more "cheeseburgery".  First I added Lawry's seasoning salt to the meat while it was cooking because my mom always added it to her homemade hamburger patties when I was growing up. I threw in some minced garlic with the meat and veggies as well. Since I didn't have celery (and don't eat it on my cheeseburgers anyway), I just added some celery salt for the flavor, as well as chili powder.  Used cream o' chicken soup and frozen veggies since it's what I had. Went lighter on the velveeta and milk (about half), but added some shredded mild cheddar (which I also put on top w/ the sour cream/chives for garnish).  And since my idea of a really good cheeseburger includes dill pickles, I added 4 teaspoons of PICKLE JUICE for an extra tang.  I personally think this was the perfect touch.  So yummy - thanks Charlotte for the great idea for a recipe!

This was a nice filling soup for a cold night.  I threw in 3 cups of rice instead of two and the soup was very thick and chunky.  I also had to sub cream of chicken soup for the cheddar cheese soup, but it still turned out nicely!

I was really nervous to try this and boy was I relieved when it came out absolutely terrific!!  Subbed Rice a Roni (without the seasoning) for regular rice and canned corn for mixed veggies.  Coupled with a salad, what a great meal!

I loved this soup. I made some changes based on what I had on hand. I substituted the can of mixed veggies with a can of rinsed and drained black beans. I added a clove of chopped garlic, deleted the celery and added twice the carrot. I used a can of papper jack cheese soup rather than chedder cheese soup. I also added about a tsp of chili powder because I think it needed a little extra kick. Great recipe and I will make it again! Thanks!

I was very disappointed in this recipe after the rave reviews.  It wasn't horrible but we felt the soup was very bland and runny.  I'm not even sure its worth trying to fix up.  Sorry

This was deeeeelicious!  Made a few changes, though.  I love Johnsonville Italian sausages, especially made as a "burger" with cheese dripping from it.  So, I used mild Johnsonville Italian sausage in place of the ground beef in this soup.  I also chunked my celery, carrots and onions instead of chopping them.  Oh, so good!  If you love sausage, try it in this recipe.  YUMMY!!!!

Made this for an ill friend, he liked it. He's not a fan of chicken noodle so thought  this might sub well. Did not change much, just no carrot, because he isn't too fond of it in things because of the sweetness. I did throw in the frozen vegetable soup mix ( carrot, peas, etc..) My daughter wasn't overly thrilled because of the Velveeta and canned soup mix... but that's OK I was looking for comfort food for someone else. Thank you!

I followed the recipe as is other than using frozen peas and corn. I don't like canned vegetables. The soup is good although I think next time I will use cream of chicken soup instead of the cheddar cheese soup. I also added grated cheddar cheese rather than Velveeta which is too expensive here in Canada. It was a nice easy soup to put together.

I was looking for something simple and filling to bring to work (and make use of a bunch of ingredients I had lying around), and this fit the bill. Delicious!

I made a LOT of changes based on the ingredients I had available.
I sauteed the onion separately, then substituted 2 cups frozen peas & carrots mix and a 12oz can of whole kernel corn in place of the fresh carrots and canned veg mix in the recipe. I left out the celery entirely. I also threw in about a teaspoon of minced garlic.
Velveeta costs more than real cheese in my grocery store, so I substituted 250 grams of shredded cheddar and an 8oz brick of cream cheese.
Used 3 cups cooked rice instead of 2.
Added 1 tbsp Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp liquid smoke, and 1 tsp crushed chilies for seasoning.
I ran out of room in the pot when it came time to add the milk, so that got left out.
Made for a nice, thick, incredibly cheesy soup.
Only thing I would change further is to increase the amount of ground beef to 2 lbs.

Will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the recipe, Charlotte!

A quick, easy, tasty comfort meal! I did try a couple of time-saver steps - I used my handheld grater to shred my carrot, celery, and onion, and I started my broth with veggies while also browning my beef. I also made my ruce and kept it separate, just ladeling the soup over a bowlful to serve.
Feel free to add your own favorite seasoning.

Excellent!  Instead of mixed veggies, my son chose green beans and carrots.  Otherwise, no changes.  Delicious!!

This was really good.  I did make a few changes: I left out the celery(as others have suggested) and the sour cream. I tasted the soup before it was time to add the sour cream and thought it was great without it, so I never added it. Next time I will leave out the peas and green beans as well.  I will definitely make this again!!

This was delicious! I didn't follow everything exactly, cause I didn't have some of the ingredients. I pretty much put all the veggies, beef, and broth. I used frozen veggies, I didn't use the processed cheese, or the cheese soup. I just added a few cups of cheddar cheese. It was still delicious! I don't like all the processed foods, but great idea!

Fabulous recipe! My four kids and husband loved it!  I used italian sausage in place of ground beef, brown rice in place of white, and only 1 1/4 c. milk.  Instead of sour cream on top, we used croutons.  I plan to make this again and again!

The kids all thought the soup was great.  Neither my husband or I liked it very much.  It was very bland.  The flavors of the meat and cheese didn't have a chance to become incorporated in the soup.  It needs more seasoning.

very good soup. I am able to get vegies into my family without any complints. I wish I could find a recipe that did not use velveeta so as not to have that fake after taste but otherwise a great soup and I have had many compliants and have been asked for the recipe.

I thought this was very good. I used Italian sausage in place of the hamburger, just to add a little zip.  I also added some garlic and I cut back on the milk a little bit.  We like our soups a little thick.  Would make again.

My kids asked for seconds when I made this soup!  (I had thirds!)
