This was really good. If you want it thicker you can add a few spoons of instant mashed potatoes-it gives it a yummy help. I also used canned evaporated milk and dehydrated chopped onion and it still came out great! Last, I added a bit of chopped parsley for added color right towards the end of cooking.

This is a good soup recipe... However, I did use chicken broth in place of water and it required more than the 1/2 cup stated. I probably used about 1 and a half cups. It needed a little bit of salt and LOTS of pepper. Overall, it was quick and easy and quite tasty.

Great recepie!  I doubled the recepie and used 2 cans of creamed corn and 4 cans of whole corn.  To thicken up the soup I added a wee bit of flour and 2 cups of heavy cream (it was too thin.  I also try added celery and carrots.  Mine tasted GREAT and my family LOVED it. I used h

Not a bad recipe, but just average.  Spiced it up with some cajun seasoning and used a whole pack of bacon.  It was simple and not hard to make but the family was only so-so on it.

After reading all the great reviews, I was really looking forward to having this on a dreary day.  It sounded so good.  What a disappointment.  It was so bland.  Like one reviewer said, it did taste like watered down creamed corn.  I even tried adding a touch of garlic, that didn't help, so I added a little ceyenne pepper..no help.  So, I tried letting it simmer thinking the flavors might blend...wrong.  Finally I added more bacon.  All that did was make me waste bacon.  It just didn't improve.  I won't make this again that is for sure.

Good grief, I love this recipe! It's super easy and reheats well - I'm a college student and time is scarce, but this one is *definitely* worth the effort! The only change I make is that I add a bit more milk and sometimes cream.

It was easy and pretty good, but the broth holding the ingredients together was a bit thin for my tastes.  I added 1/4 cup of milk with 3 tablespoons of cornstarch in it to thicken, and a pat of butter.  I think next time I'll add some celery.

This chowder has a wonderful flavor!  I didn't use the entire 2 cups of milk.  I'd also let everything (after you add the corn) simmer about 15 minutes to thicken it up.

Like a lot of opinions in here, this chowder did turn out a bit thin. I made it the night before to serve for the next night's dinner,hoping it would thicken up, but I still had to add a little cornstarch to get the consistency I was looking for.  It tasted fine in the end, but my kids weren't as thrilled with it as they are with the one in the restaurant.

UPDATE: MUCH BETTER THE NEXT DAY (SOUP THICKENED NICELY). This is very comforting, filling & perfect for a chilly night, but... it's pretty bland as is. In it's favor, you can really add pizzaz by adding s&p to taste (beware... you MUST add a LOT of both to this basic soup!). This is a nice recipe to build off of, but as with any new recipe I try, I hesitate to make "major" changes b4 giving it it's rightful chance to win my approval "as is." Having said this, I do think the addition of any number of spices, celery, carrots or cheese (melted into the soup) would enhance this considerably. Adding chopped scallions & a GENEROUS sprinkling of pepper to my bowl helped somewhat. NOTE: Many reviewers complained about "watery" soup. Yes, this soup is thin. I ended up adding a few spoonfuls of instant (garlic herb) potato flakes & that seemed to do the trick. Draining your sweet corn (at least partially) also helps. And despite other's comments about the corn / potato ratio, I felt both were spot on. My only other changes were subbing a 12 oz. can of ff evaporated milk (was out of skim) & chicken broth in lieu of H2O (to add flavor). For those of you who skipped the bacon... of course your soup was bland!!! I sauteed my onions in bacon grease as directed & STILL felt this seriously lacked flavor! If you are going to skip the bacon to save calories, you should probably try another recipe. All in all, this was "OK," but I doubt I'll make it again. Thanks anyways, Ellen. :-)

I love this recipe.  I made it for my in-laws and I am back printing the recipe for them.  I must say, I did doctor it up a bit with more pepper and a few more potatoes.

I made this twice in one week at the request of my family. The first time I kept it the same. The second time around I cut fresh corn of the cob and added a cup of half and half. It's great for a fall day in Maine! Thanks!

A amazing blending of a corn chowder .It is bright and cheery and oh so deliscious. Wouldn't change a thing except perhaps increase the size of the finished product cause what I made went way too fast!

I used to love the corn chowder in a can when I was a kid, but now I like to make all my soups from scratch (a lot less sodium and more flavor that way). I used this recipe as a base. I didn't use any bacon because I don't eat pork products, but my husband and I thought this was amazing. Since some reviewers said it was too thin, I used 4 potatoes instead of 2, and used only one can of creamed corn. I topped it with a splash of hot sauce and some freshly snipped chives and it was wonderful! Really comforting and definitely brought me back to my childhood with the same delicious flavor.

I wanted to like this due to the positive reviews, but was disappointed.  Two cans of creamed corn makes this too sweet - my husband asked if I had added sugar.  Aside from the sweetness - it was just too plain.  Next time I'll try the "Corn Chowder - Fast and Great" on this site that uses a chicken broth base.

This recipe looked good but I wanted to add a little spice.  I added a can of green chilis, some cilantro, and a couple thick sliced zucchinis.  It was awesome and definitely a keeper!  It's one of my favorites!

I liked this recipe a lot. I added green onions for garnish too, but because I didn't have 2 cans of creamed corn, I used one can, half a can of niblets, and only 1 cup of milk. I didn't halve the other ingredients, and the recipe still turned out. I used 1% milk, but for a richer dish, I'd use cream.

Not bad, but a little bland for my taste.  I added a little dried rosemary (maybe 1/4 tsp) and a LOT of cinnamon (maybe 3 tbs), plus some freshly ground nutmeg.  
I also put a stick blender to it to get the consistency I wanted.  I left a little chunkiness, in mine.  In the end it turned out really well, but I had to modify the recipe.

Delicious! This is a real nice comfort food. I added bits of ham, crispy crumbled bacon and used half and half. I used chicken stock in place of water. I also used half of an red onion, chopped and two red potatoes, cubed, with skin on. I added four ears of fresh corn along with one can of cream-style corn. I let it simmer for a while to thicken up and seasoned with Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. I served this with homemade, "J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits," also from this website.

Great easy recipe for corn chowder. Made a few adjustments: I used chicken stock instead of water, used 2 cans of corn instead of just one and omitted the bacon to cut down on the salt content (but WILL try it next time WITH bacon). Overall, a good recipe :) And it's great for the budget, too!

This was a tasty recipe. However, I added about 2 teaspoons of chicken boullion and it really increased the flavor. Will definitely make this again.

I have made this chowder several times. I used 1 cup milk and 1 cup 1/2 and1/2.  I also added about 2 tbsp of chicken bullion paste.  I quadrupled the recipe for a Labor Day Party, everyone loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  It was quite bland and not very creamy.  I had to add some cajun seasoning to it to give it some flavor.  Even then it wasn't all that great. Not horrible but not that great.  I will not be making this again.

Overall this chowder was ok. To me, it tasted like creamed corn mixed with bacon grease, which is essentially what it is, but with a few other ingredients mixed in. Just not what I was looking for.

The very first thing I did was saute the onion in butter (not bacon drippings) along with half of a red pepper that I had leftover from fajitas.  Then I added cubed sweet potatoes and sauteed that for about 5 minutes.  Then I added in the half cup of water with a chicken bouillon cube.  Brought that to a simmer for about 20 minutes.  Then I added the corn, creamed corn, salt, pepper, and ONE cup of HALF AND HALF (not milk).  It tasted bland so to it I added about 4 dashes of hot sauce and 2 teaspoons creole seasoning.  It was almost perfect . . . but not quite.  I remembered the best corn chowder I ever had - had a lot of cheese in it.  So, I shredded a combination of colby, monterey jack, and fontina cheese that I had - about 1 1/2 cups and slowly stirred that in.  (You can use just a mexican blend of shredded cheese found at any grocery store too!)

IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.  I mean the most perfect thing I have made from this web site!  My husband who isn't ever excited about any recipe because he isn't a big food critic totally loved it!

So basically the changes were this:  Sweet Potato (although I doubt this had any impact on it), added red pepper to saute, half and half instead of regular milk (1 cup instead of 2), hot sauce, creole seasoning, and grated cheese.

Wonderful soup!  I served this for lunch for a group of women today and everyone LOVED it.  My husband was happy, too.  I substituted Land O Lakes Fat Free Half and Half for the milk but kept everything else the same.  I will definitely make this many times.

I thought this was really good.  I cooked the potatoes separately and threw in a chicken bullion cube for some added flavor.  I also sauted some garlic with the onion, added some extra milk and 2 tbs of corn starch to thicken it up a little.  I finished it of with a splash of liquid smoke and boy was it good.  My husband is not a soup fan but he liked this.  I will definately make this again.

My mom has made this soup for years. It was probably our first-ever AllRecipes meal. For as long as I can remember I've made this for my birthday. The best corn chowder, ever, in my opinion!

Made this for supper today and it is wonderful. I read other reviews and made some changes as well. I used Olive oil for cooking the onion and also a clove of garlic. Then I used chicken stock instead of water and also added frozen corn not canned. I will def make this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Good soup though I wouldn't consider it "a-maize-ing."  I improvised by using ham instead of bacon (since I had leftover ham) and frozen corn in place of cream-style corn, which I also did not have in the cupboard.  I added some leftover mashed potatoes and some sprinkles of Cajun Seasoning.  It was good though I doubt I will make it again.

Was really just looking for the basic ingredients.  I just about doubled it, but did add chicken bouillon to the water I simmered the potatoes in.  Also added some garlic in with my onions.  Didn't change anything much.  For as basic as the recipe is, it is suitably tasty.  If you're looking for a restaurant-level chowder go somewhere that wants a roux.

I didn't use the bacon grease after cooking the bacon. I used olive oil for the onions and added 1 cup of chicken broth in place of the water. Then I poured the mixture in the blender. Nice consistency, I'll be sure to make it again. Thank you!

I added some celery and carrots to the mix.  I mashed one of the potatoes after cooking then added it to the soup to make it a little thicker.  Next time I might use cream instead of the milk to give it a little more body.  This is easily a five star chowder!

Absolutely delicious (and easy)!  I made this a few months back and have made it about every other week since then. It pairs well with cornbread.  I do prefer it without bacon, which is not the norm for me since everything tastes better with bacon.  I also add an extra can of corn, per another review.  To top it off I add some shredded cheddar.  It's the perfect recipe for a cold winter's day...a must try!

Corn chowder is a rather bland meal, but maybe that's why it is so comforting.  My additions always include a cup of cheedar cheese and a few dashes of Franks red hot sauce.  Serve with more cheese sprinkled on top.

I thought this was an excellent recipe for corn chowder! I love Hale & Hearty Soups' sweet corn chowder and this was very similar. I followed other suggestions and used water from the can of corn to cook the potatoes. I also substituted one of the cups of milk with a can of cream of chicken soup. I only used half an onion (large yellow), and used a pinch of cayenne in addition to the salt and black pepper. My only word of advice would be to watch out for how much salt you use. It gets very salty once you add the bacon. I will be making this again soon, it's very easy and perfect for fall!

I made this as an early afternoon "snack" before the Thanksgiving feast that evening.  My husband loved this corn chowder!  The only thing I changed was I used 1 cup milk and 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the 2 cups of milk.  Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it with us!

This is very good - I like that it doesn't use flour to thicken. I used an extra can of corn - white shoepeg, just to give it more texture, and about 1 more potato. I added some Old Bay and dry mustard, and quite a bit of pepper. I think this is a fun recipe to play with on seasoning - I'm thinking about a little curry next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it!  I doubled the recipe and made a clonking great big batch of it!  It was easy to make and delicious.  I found that leftovers were even better.  I made only two changes: I left out the salt, and I stirred the bacon right into the chowder before serving.  I'll make it again for sure!  Thanks for the recipe, Ellen G!

I dont give 5 stars because no recipe is perfect, but if i did this one would get it. The only thing i changed was i sub 1/2 heavy cream for 1/2 the milk and served with shredded cheddar. A keeper   thanx

The chowder is the best we've ever had.  Even better than any that we've ordered in the best restaurants.  I left out the bacon and instead of all milk I used 1/2 cup skim milk and 1 1/2 cups of Land o Lakes fat free cream.  It was thick and rich.  Try it......you'll love it!!

Even after burning the bacon the flavor of the soup was great!  Everyone loved it.  Substitute in Green onions, and the flavor is a lighter, and it adds some color for presentation.  Its Great!

Can't wait to make this for dinner, will follow the suggestions and use chicken broth, and saute celery with the onion and bacon, but because it is summer and corn on the cob is everywhere I am using fresh corn (6-8 ears). I didn't see anyone on any of the recipes for "corn chowder" that cuts the corn off the cob and then adds the cob for flavor while simmering. It makes a HUGE difference! I made the chicken tortilla soup from this site and added corn on the cob, and simmered the cob in the soup! Absolutely fantastic! It adds soooo much flavor and the cream from the cob thickens it perfectly.... Ohhhhh I can't wait! I love corn on the cob and corn chowder!

It's not bad, but very bland if you don't add A LOT more spice. I sauted onion and garlic in butter, not oil, and also added thyme and a little soup mix when cooking the potatoes. Towards the end I added both sweet and spicy paprika, coriander, and a lot more salt.

I have been using this recipe over the years and it IS an easy corn chowder. Here is what i do now to make it tastier and thicker. I use red potatoes, evaporated milk, 1 cup or so of diced chicken, 1 clove of minced garlic sauteed with the onion, 1tsp of tyme. salt and pepper to taste. My family loves it. I still include the bacon YUmMY!

Delicious! Changed out half a cup of the milk for some heavy whipping cream and added a generous about of black pepper. Then when it was done I threw it in the blender for a nice creamy texture.

OUTSTANDING!  Here is the key: use 1 cup water with chicken boullion for the potatoes and mix in the onions that were sauteed in bacon drippings while the potatoes soften (I practically pureed the onions in the food processor before adding them to the bacon drippings), then add 1/2 cup half-and-half, 1 can condensed cream of chicken soup, pepper to taste (no salt necessary since you used bacon drippings to sautee the onions and that's going right in the soup), 1/2 tablespoon of garlic powder, then the 2 cans creamed corn and 1 can whole kernel corn (after draining the water from the can)...MAYBE add in a quick spurt of milk to make it a little thinner, and throw in the chopped bacon bits (made as suggested, although I threw them in a food processor before mixing right into the soup) right before serving.  Seriously one of the best recipes of all time.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth and substituted 1 cup of milk with a can of cream of chicken soup (per other reviewers suggestions) to thicken it up a bit...also threw in a couple shakes of crushed red pepper to give it a little zing (we love spicy).  Very good...am definitely keeping this recipe!!

My husband ate every bit of this over the course of 3 days. I replaced the salt with an equal amount of Cajun seasoning mix and used all creamed corn (because I was trying to get rid of it). Those were the only changes I made; it was very easy; and I will make it for him again!

This was really yummy! The kids loved it too!  I did change the original recipe a bit though. I doubled the amount of corn, potatoes and onion. Then I used  1 can of evaporated milk instead of the regular milk, next time I may use cream. I had to add a bit more water to the onion and potato mixture so they would cook properly.  I also added two really big spoonfuls of sourcream when I combined all the ingrediants.  It gave it a really nice flavor and thickened it up a bit.  
I will definately be preparing this agian.

Four stars because I made a few changes. I used chicken broth instead of water (4 cups), two more potatoes and 4 cups of fresh corn (because I had so much extra corn on the cob that I had to use). I also spiced it up a little with 1 t. chili powder, 1/2 t. cayenne pepper, 1 t. garlic powder and a bay leaf. Used two cups of 1/2 and 1/2 in place of milk. Topped with the crumbled bacon and a dab of sour cream. Delish! Next time I might try to thicken it a little, but I suppose if you use the cream corn and less liquid it would be thicker.

Very Easy & Delicious! I only made a couple of changes.  I added salt and pepper to potatoes and onions while cooking and used 1 cup half & half and 1 cup Milk (this is what I had on hand).  Also I added about 1/3 Cup each of Cheddar & Monterey Jack Cheese with a little bit of Cayenne Pepper for extra kick.  I will definitely make this chowder again.

This soup was so incredibly easy and very tasty.  Wonderful in the winter.  I've made it once, but plan to make it again soon.  The bacon adds such a good flavor.  Don't change a thing!!

Not too impressed with this recipe.  Sounded really good, especially with bacon, but tasted like watered down cream corn.

I make it in a crockpot, and it comes out wonderfully! It’s frequently requested at our office potlucks. I cook the bacon, onion, and potatoes the night before, then in the morning, put all of the ingredients in the crockpot, bring it to my office, and set it on low. I stir it a few times during heating, and about a half hour before lunchtime, mash the potatoes until the chowder is at the desired consistency. Yummy!

We loved it.  I didn't have bacon but I had some bacon drippings and I added bacon bits in the jar.  It turned out perfect.

Although delicious, there’s too much fat for this diabetic. If you left out the bacon and the butter it would be more heart-friendly.

I tried this recipe bkz it used milk instead of a chicken broth. I added celery and carrots, which gave the soup some color. My husband wasn't overly impressed but I thought it was good.

Used double the amount of whole milk, and added a can of evaporated milk as well.  (we like it more traditional, rather than "creamy")  By using this recipe as a start, we can now make it w/o a recipe!  Simple, quick and YUMMY

Coming from New England we love corn chowd-ah
almost as much as clam chowder (no TOMATOES please).  This version is rich and creamy just how we like it.

This is a good start, but I definitely felt the need to spice it up a bit. I added some crushed red pepper and my regular "spice it till it tastes right" formula of oregano, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and parsley. It was a bit on the thin side, so I did add instant mashed potatoes and even ended up adding cornstarch at the end to make it thicker. With my changes, it was a big hit at Christmas dinner and tasted even better the next day! Definitely a keeper!

it was great but as like everybody else said it was thin so, I added some flour to it which made it better! did 4 pieces of bacon instead of 6 and put it in the pot. Put two tbsp of bacon drippings in, pinch of Cheyenne pepper to give it a kick, a lil more pepper, no salt, 2 extra whole kernel cans, 2 small onions, 1/4 of lb potatoes, 1/4 water, 1 cup half and half, some garlic powder and 1 tbsp of oregano and basil! it was delish!

I picked this recipe because of its simple ingredients, but I realized that I didn't have everything on-hand!  So I replaced the cubed potatoes with 2 cups of prepared mash potatoes (these had 2 Tbsp of butter added), and instead of 2 cans of cream-style corn and 1 can of whole kernel corn, I used 1 can cream-style corn (this part you can't skip) and 2 cups of frozen whole kernel corn.  Also, I skipped the bacon.  The family gave it rave reviews.  If the soup isn't thick enough, simply add more water or milk to thin it out.  I will definitely make this again -- and will try it when I actually have potatoes on-hand, but I think I will mash them up for a smooth consistency.

This is a corn soup--not chowder.  The recipe doesn't specify a certain kind of milk.  I used 1%.  It needs a thicker milk or add milk or cornstarch.  Drain the corn.  The flavor was mild but I definitely could taste the corn and the bacon.  I didn't crumble the bacon overtop.  I used it for something else.  Next time, I add a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch to 1/4 cup milk.  I think that will make it thick enough.

Exactly what I was looking for in a corn chowder! Perfectly sweet and flavorful. I used about 1.5 cups of milk and added some instant mashed potato flakes to thicken it up a little, based on previous reviews. I will make this again and again. Yum.

Always comforting and filling. :-) I often substitute some milk for half and half to make it a little creamier.

Very good. I like that it's simple to make. Used 1 1/2 c. milk and 1/2c. half and half. I love creamy soups and will probably use 1c. milk and 1c. heavy whipping cream next time.

This was easy and delicious! I had 2 ears of fresh corn so I used them instead of a can of corn. I also used about 2 cups of diced red potatoes with the skins on and I added a cup of chopped green chili.  I used a bit more water with the potatoes and added another cup of water at the end because it seemed a bit too thick.

My family loved this chowder.  The only change I made was to use chicken instead of bacon.  Simple and very good.

This soup was very good without being overly rich.  I would definitely make it again.

This was such a great comfort soup!  I used half and half instead of milk and it had a little beat of sweetness added to the robust flavor of the onion and bacon. I also used just half of the onion but I think it would have been great with the whole onion too.  It was just great with the cold weather and a little bit of the sniffles on my part.  Thanks!

This was pretty good, but I don't think I'll make it again.  It's pretty thin for a chowder.  It's also too sweet for me, but canned corn is pretty sweet.  It might be better made with fresh corn.

EXCELLENT! I used condensed milk instead and my family loved it...but it was a little sweet for me...next time I will try one cup of cream instead of the condensed milk.  Otherwise, this was wonderful.  Bravo Sunnybyrd!

Either use 2 really large or 3 to 4 smaller potatoes.  Use the liquid from the can of corn as part of the water for the potatoes.  If it comes out soupy, add a few instant mashed potatoes for thickener.

This recipe was wonderful! I did make some modifications, I used 3 potatoes instead of 2, added some seasoned salt, I didn't have any regular whole kernel corn so I just used the two cans of creamed corn. After reading other reviews I added half a can cream of chicken soup to add more flavor and thicken it up a bit. Will definitely be making this in the future!

This soup is a little watery after cook and I was hoping mine to be slightly thicker.  The recipe did not mention if kennel corn needs to be drained or undrained so that added a little liquid maybe I needed to drained first.  My husband and my daughter likes it so I still give it four stars, I will try different recipe next time.

This recipe was so easy to make! I added seasoning throughout the cooking process (the onions and potatoes) to make sure that it would be flavourful. I also added less liquid so as to make the chowder more thick. I highly recommend this recipe for anyone!

I wanted to make soup for lunch at work tomorrow, and saw today's review of this recipe. All I can say is YUM! The only things I did differently were to use veggie stock instead of water, and I pre-cooked the potatoes before stirring them in. I'm not gonna add the bacon until tomorrow because I don't want it get soggy. If I were to make this again, I think I'd throw in a can of clams too. Thanks, Ellen!

My husband loved this (corn lover) We do plan to tweak it in the future... not sure how, just to spice it up a bit. One change we did make was to put the bacon right in it instead of sprinkle on top.

I used chicken stock instead of water and dissolved some flour in the milk before adding it. I also used a celery stalk (for 1/2 recipe). Added some parsley and pepper, but the chowder still tastes too much like creamed corn. I guess it's okay if you like that, but I would have preferred something more complex-tasting. It's quite easy to make, at least; I made it last-minute for my husband to take to work for lunch.

This was just ok and I even had to add a lot of spices and herbs in order for it to have any flavor.  Sorry but I am removing this one from my recipe box.

Great recipe.  For those who have trouble thickening, I blended some of the broth with corn and used that as a thickener.  Worked perfectly and you can add your milk or half and half a little at a time to get it the consistency you want.

I triple the recipe and barely have any leftovers!  My kids love this and my 17 y/o requests it for football nights!  He wants me to make it for the whole team on game night.  I don't change a thing except cook it a little longer to thicken it up just a bit.  Highly recommend it and it is so easy.  I added crab to it once and served it at a tail-gate party... first thing to go!

With others' suggested changes, this was great.  Used 1 c milk, 1 c heavy cream.  Simmered for 15 minutes all together to thicken.  Used chicken bouillon in water to boil potatoes.  Tastes great re-heated, too.

This was easy to make and really fills you up! Ensure you strain the reserved bacon grease or else you'll darken the color of the chowder.

So quick and simple that you just throw everything in and leave.
