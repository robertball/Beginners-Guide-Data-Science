This is not a good **fudge** recipe.  Too  soft and runny, doesn't cut...
However, it is an AMAZING fruit dip - especially with strawberries and apples!

The recipe says one 5 oz can of evaporated milk,  but evaporated milk only comes in one size,  (12 oz) that I didn't check  (because of the way the recipe was worded) until my fudge was too runny & wouldn't set.   So I tried to fix it  the next day & it would not fix.  So we are eating it out of a bowl with spoons.  Be careful of the milk!

This recipe as written is a massive fail. I can literally eat anything and find value in it.  I had made awesome fudge with Herseyâ€™s sea salt caramel baking chips and condensed milk. I was hopeful with this because the sea salt caramel chips are hard to find. Right off, the consistency of the evaporative milk was too liquidy.. I continued on and did each step. After all was done, I poured the mixture into a dish wth parchment paper and let it cool. After a couple hours, it was still not fudge. So I put it in the fridge overnight. The next day I took I it out and tried to slice the 'fudge.' It was taffy like and incredibly sticky. More like caramel with more stick. I ate a few pieces and declared it destined for the trash. Sorry. In the future I will only use condensed milk and caramel baking chips. Sorry.

Taste good but not fudge consistany.  Never firmed up and had to throw it away as I couldn't figure how to use it.
