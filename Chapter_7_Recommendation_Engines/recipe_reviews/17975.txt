This is officially my very favorite burger recipe!  I've made this recipe twice.  However, I have not been able to find ground chicken in my grocery store, so I made this recipe with ground turkey instead.  It was fabulous!  In addition, I do not have a grill, so I put about 1/4 cup of veggie oil in a skillet and cook the burgers on each side for about 4 minutes until they are golden brown.  Then, I drain the burgers on paper towels and serve them with cheese on top.  The veggies give the burger excellent flavor and add a lot of moisture.  Very yummy and easy to make!!

REALLY REALLY GOOD! used green pepper b/c thats what i had also added chopped mushrooms... a keeper to be used AGAIN & AGAIN !! Also I first placed burgers on a piece of alum. foil and grilled for approx 2 minutes on each side before placing directly on grates, this eliminated my worry of them falling apart

You MUST try this recipe.  The picture does not do these burgers any justice not to mention the title!  Both a little on the BLAH side but these burgers are outstanding.  I've never heard or seen 'old bay seasoning' (i'm from Canada) but i know the stuff is in everything on this site.  A little research yielded some helpful advice (luv google).  A little celery seed, mustard seed, bay leaf, paprika, pepper...and some more things i can't quite recall. Anyhow, absolutely deee-licious and the burgers maintained a nice firm round shape throughout the entire process.  Served on whole wheat buns with a little ranch dressing and lettuce.  I was in heaven!

As burgers, this just did not work for me-- I would have needed to add several times more the amount of bread crumbs to get patties that would stand up to the rigors of grilling.

Not to be deterred, however, I placed the mixture into a pre-greased loaf pan and made chickenloaf instead, baking at 350 for 30 minutes.   It tasted pretty good (I admit I, too, was doubtful about the carrots), so it all worked out in the end.  This recipe DID encourage me to look for (and successfully find) Old Bay seasoning, which I admit I had never heard of as someone raised and still living in the midwest, so I have a new staple in my spice collection.  I might make this as a loaf again in the future, if I have a taste for it.  Thank you, Teri!

Very good stuff! If you're scaling, however, keep the amount of egg and bread crumbs the same, or you'll get goopy burgers.

These were pretty good but not outstanding. The red bell pepper worked well, but I am not so sure about the carrot. Also, I wish I had used Cavenders Greek Seasoning and not Old Bay Seasoning - to me, OBS tastes overwhelmingly of celery salt which I don't much care for. I found I needed way more breadcrumbs than the recipe called for. I might make these again, but I would definitely play around with the ingredients.

Really good.  This can be made into a very delicious vegetarian version by using the mock chicken recipe.

I use boneless skinless chicken breasts and put the meat in my food processor. (Also do the veggies in the processor--just don't turn things to mush.)  Cheaper than buying ground chicken and I know (more or less) what I'm eating.  At least I can trim it up just as I want.
I think it really helps to refrigerate or freeze the burgers before cooking.  Can also add some flax meal to make them even healthier.  Lots of room for variation and personal taste here!

Awesome burger.  I didn't have all of the vegetables that the recipe called for so used onion, peas, tomatoes, carrots and shredded zucchini.  I also added some powdered chicken bullion while the veggies were cooking.  I followed the rest of the recipe and these are up there on the best burgers I've eaten list.  
Next time I'm going to do feta, sun dried tomatoes and spinach.  Oh the possibilities!

This recipe makes great burgers. Whole family loved them.  I made too much for our young/small family of 4 because I used 2 lbs of ground chicken as directed.  HOWEVER, this was a nice mistake!  I used what I needed for the burgers and put the rest back in the fridge.  The next day, I used it to make a pizza with Chicken, Goat Cheese, Sundried tomatoes, Spinach and Onions.  But WAIT, there's more!!!  I froze the remaining chicken in a ziplock bag thinking that it would be a while before I used it.  About 3 days later, I wanted to make Mexican food, but had no meat. Out comes our hero again. This time I cooked the remaining chicken in a skillet, removed half and added some taco seasoning for my kids' "Burritos" (Chicken and Cheese).  Finally, I used the remainder in some Enchiladas by mixing in some cream cheese, filling and rolling tortillas, pouring some enchilada sauce on them and Mexican cheese, and then baking it all in the oven for 15 minutes.  BY FAR, the most use I've gotten out of one recipe. I plan to keep this one just as my new "base" for numerous more experiments.  Thanks for a new staple in our menu!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I don't think the ingredient amounts stated in the recipe are correct.  I only used 1 pound of ground chicken, so theoretically I should've cut the rest of the in half, but there would've been WAY too much stuff in there for my liking.  I added less than 1/4c of onions, maybe 1/8c red peppers, omitted the carrots, saved the tomatoes for a topping after they were cooked, and sauteed the mushrooms in a pan with EVOO, garlic powder and onion powder.  If your chicken burgers won't stay together, you probably have too many veggies in them...add them slowly, cause you can always add more but it's hard to take them out!  Also, if it's very mushy, just add more breadcrumbs.  Our burgers came out perfectly and every bite was as delicious as the first.  Will definitely make over and over again!

Fantastic! I only used 1 lb. of extra lean ground chicken...so I also decreased the veggie amounts. The one thing that I did do was to put the carrot, onion and garlic through my food processor on the grate blade so they were nice and fine. I also fine chopped the tomato, red pepper and mushrooms by hand. This mixture was nice and bulked up the burgers without feeling like I was biting into huge hunks of veggies. So I would suggest to make sure that the veggies are finely chopped. I also omitted the egg....didnt feel the need for it, and also used 1/2 tblspn of the Old Bay. We really loved these burgers...topped with munster cheese and I didnt even use a roll.....just plain with a salad. Very flavorful! Thanks!

LOVE THESE! Since having to watch fats, I find myself dying for a hamburger. These were the solution! DH turned his nose up at them when he saw the ground chicken. After the grilling, though, he devoured them! Planned to take them to the fishcamp this weekend but only had 2 left! Very goo recipe! Will definitely make these again!!!!

These burgers are much better for you than using beef.  I tried them for the first time recently as I am watching my weight and was surprised to find how delicious they are.  I will rarely use beef again if ever.  One thing I have found is not to add the egg and to just add a small amount of bread crumbs into the chicken mixture.  The egg makes the mixture to loose.  When the mixture is formed into patties I then lay them on bread crumbs so they are coated on the outside.  This makes them hold together while grilling and forms a nice texture to the burgers.  You can also vary the ingredients to your liking.  Hope this helps. Oakville Kathy

following some other people's advice, I cut on the amount of carrot by half, and added less of the other veggies. I added some salt and a bit of Dijon. Great recipe! I also put it in the oven to bake for some minutes. When I flipped sides, I also put the buns cut in half to toast lightly.

Amazing flavor!! I cooked mine in the broiler and after reading some comments I didn't even bother use a rack since it sounded like they would probably fall through. Its not like they are sitting in fat while you're broiling them so there wasn't really a need for a rack.
Absolutely scrumptious and a def keeper!

Wow, this is a great recipe! I made this for dinner today and it really came out wonderfully.  Tasty and juicy. As I didn't have a grill, I broiled the burgers in my oven. The results were excellent! just as we like them. I served them with basmati rice. I will make them again and again. 
Making the patties is easier if you wet your hands with a little water.

This was so good!  The vegetables keep the meat moist so you dont have to worry about over cooking it.  (I always worry with chicken)  It is healthy and delicious!  This has become one of my favorite recipes.

We love this recipe!  Full of vegetables so it is healthy and the veggies make the burgers so moist.  I have made them with ground turkey, ground chicken and ground soy and all were good although the ground soy needed to be grilled on tin foil since they didn't hold together as well as the poultry ones.  We can't get Old Bay Seasoning in Canada so I use a Cajun spice mix instead.

I didn't use the mushrooms, but I don't think that made a big difference at all. I LOVED THESE. We made them inside on a grill pan since it's freezing outside, and they were simply delicious. We sauteed all the veggies together (putting the tomatoes in last), and really just let it cook for up to 10 minutes. 
I will definitely make them again.

Excellent recipe!  My 18 month old son, who hates all vegetables, loved this burger.  I love how many veggies there are hidden inside.  Thank you for a healthy and nutritious recipe.  I will be making these often.

I made these tonight and they were YUMMY!!! I modified the recipe by only adding onion, 1/2 green and 1/2 red pepper and garlic. I didn't have the Old Bay seasoning so I used McCormick Montreal chicken seasoning with the ground chicken (that I ground), 1 egg, and 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs. They didn't fall apart at all!!! Put slices of thick cheddar cheese on them and my family LOVED them!!!

Tip: Make sure you grill is not to hot. Also lay tin foil on your grill that you have sprayed with Pam. I tried this last night and apparently my grill was way too hot. I put them on the grill and ran inside to get the spatula. Upon returning to the grill my burgers were already black on on side. I was inside literally less than 2 minutes. I attempted to move them and see if I could save them and they stuck then just fell apart completely. I gave it 3 stars because the prep seem to go well and but the cooking part did not work. I do intend on trying this again so the rating could change.

These were delicious!  At first, it seemed like a lot of work for burgers, but it's well worth it!  Next time though, I will just use my food processor to finely chop the veggies.  Some found them them a wee bit spicy (I didn't think so), so if you're squeamish that way, be careful.

These were definitely tasty but incredibly messy and hard to grill.  They literally fell apart on the grill.  Maybe it was the fact that I used turkey instead of chicken.  At any rate, it was a good dinner but not one that I think I will make again.

Made them exactly per recipe, and they were amazing. My husband is a diehard fan of beef but even he loved these. No sauce or ketchup or even toppings needed.

These were SO delicious!! I didn't have Old Bay seasoning so I just left it out and added some fresh basil. I also used only one lb of chicken but left all other measurements the same, which made eight small-medium sized patties. I really like the addition of the veggies and was thrilled when my two year old asked for more! I will be making these again, maybe next time I'll try turkey meat to see how it comes out.

This was pretty good, but if I made it again, I'd put in less Old Bay.  That stuff is /strong/.

AWESOME!! Picky husband loved them. I did leave out a few things for personal tatse. I used old bay, salt and pepper, the onions, garlic and green pepper, egg and bread crumbs. Used the grill! What a great taste the old bay gives it, different but great idea!!

This is a very tasty recipe and easy to make.  The only problem is that the patties are too wet to grill and I had trouble flipping for a pan fry.  I ended up putting the patties on a cookie sheet and baking at 350 degrees.  They turned out wonderful!  I have made them twice and with the Old Bay, I do not need to add additional salt. After baking, I wrap them individually in foil and freeze to be used later.

This is my go to burger recipe!  It sneaks in some veggies for the non veggie lovers!  I ground my own chicken breasts, which is fantastic.  I make it as the recipe says for the most part except I did not have Old Bay Seasoning so in place I used Monterey Chicken spice and Mrs Dash Original blend.  I served on whole wheat buns with sliced tomatoes and cucumbers after grilling on a George Foreman.  Healthy...and delicious.

I'm not normally a fan of chicken burgers, but I made these tonight and they looked incredible, held together amazingly, and smelled sooooo good. 

I messed mine up by subbing soda cracker crumbs for bread crumbs. I do this quite often with success but in this case my soda crackers had gone mouldy or something while still in the package.

Also... I didn't have mushrooms, and I've never seen or tasted 'Old Bay' seasoning so I just added some basil, oregano, lots of pepper, and some BBQ Chicken seasoning from 'The Keg'. These burgers are pretty versatile I think, so I would suggest you go ahead and add whatever seasoning you want to them.

In the future, I think I'll be making these quite often, with various veggies added (zucchini instead of carrot maybe?) more garlic, (like 5 cloves) and more salt and/or salty seasoning. (The chicken I'm using isn't pre-seasoned.)

I brushed my burgers with Franks Red Hot BBQ sauce which I thought was PERFECT for these burgers, and I melted some monterey jack cheese on top. Fresh Kaiser buns buttered and placed on the grill for a minute or so, (for the warm, crisp-outside, chewy-inside texture) and a bit of mayo and lettuce on the bun... mmm!

Too bad mine are all going in the garbage, haha. I'm making them again tomorrow though, with some FRESH crackers or bread crumbs.  :) Thanks for a great recipe!

I usually cook for one since I live alone so I cut the recipe in half! I took the suggestion from the reviews and kept the egg and bread crumbs the same as per the original recipe. I made two patties (cooked one for dinner) and froze one for a later time! I refrigerated the rest (~two servings) and I used the leftovers today to make a chicken salad for lunch and a chicken wrap for dinner. It was absolutely delicious! =)

These were wonderful.  The best burger I've had.  The whole family raved about them including my 14 yr old daughter.  I too used ground turkey because that was what was available and I added basil that I had on hand.  This will definitely be a go to summer recipe.

A very excellent Chicken sandwich! I read that people has issues with the mixture being too loose and the need to add more bread crumbs. I decided to leave out the tomato as I felt it would add to much moisture. The half cup bread crumbs is perfect. I added a slice of tomato on top of the patty after cooking. Very Very good!

Im not the authority on chicken burgers and these are the first ones I have made. They were interesting I guess i was expecting a hamburger like feel but it was more like a meatloaf. My husband said these are like chicken nuggets on a bun. He didnt care for them and the kids got both theirs down but didnt seem enthused. I dont think chicken burgers are for us.

I hate to give such a low rating on something everyone finds wonderful, but this recipe was not only difficult because of having to add more and more breadcrumbs, but adding all the vegetables into the ground chicken made for a really strange taste for us. I don't think we'll try this again.

These were pretty good.  Though, I thought it was a little heavy on carrots, but that may be because I incorrectly estimated the quantity of baby carrots.  Put them on a bun with the normal hamburger fixins and the kids gobbled them up without questioning what was inside the burgers.  Hubby didn't care for them, but will make again due to how healthy they are.  I did not have trouble with them staying together like others did -- cooked them in the grill pan.  Used fresh meat and wonder if others that had them fall apart used frozen, thawed meat which always seems wetter to me.  ??

A great, flavorful alternative to beef burgers.  Try with sliced avocados, sliced green onions and a dollop of chipolte sauce...with or without a bun!

These were so good and so easy. 
I dont BBQ so I pan fried them in Pam spray.
I didnt have bread crumbs or Old bay seasoning so I used some dried stuffing mix and dried savory. Kids loved them!
Oh, also left out the tomato.

OMG...so awesome.  I used .81 pounds of chicken breast...about 5 carrots, 1/2 onion, 1/2 green pepper, tomato, 1 egg and at least 4 T of breadcrumbs.  They are so good.  I used a tiny bit of swiss on top when I grilled them and then didn't even use a bun to eat it...I ate it with one of my favorite salads (the one with raman noodles, broccoli slaw)  YUMMY!

You must try this recipe, one of my favorite burgers on the BBQ, you can use chicken or turkey. I recommend to double the bread crumbs. I couldn't find any old bay seasoning but still turned out FANTASTIC! Also, I makes a great meat loaf.

This recipe is incredible!!!  We had this tonight with our neighbors.  Everyone raved and even asked to take the left overs!!!  The only thing I did different is I only used 1 carrot, 1 3/4 cup fresh mushrooms half a tomato.  Then I actually put everything into the food process until puree then I sauteed it on med-high to get the moisture out. And I didn't have OBS so I used 3 tea cumin and 1 tea oregano. We served it on pepper jack cheese!  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious!  I cut the recipe in half but still used the whole egg and just added more bread crumbs.  The nice thing about this recipe is you can make them ahead of time and grill them when you are ready.  I followed another's advise and served them with lettuce and ranch dressing on a fresh kaiser roll, yummy!  P.S.  I think sauteing the vegies is a must.

I didn't like this recipe because of the texture. I followed the recipe and no-one wanted to eat them. I ended up tossing them. Also ground chicken is very expensive where I live. I think I'll stick to turkey burgers.

Loved these.  We used green pepper instead of red because it was what we had and it turned out fine.  I also omitted Old bay seasoning, carrots and tomato(not tastes I love in chicken).  Cooked indoors because the weather was bad, but we all loved them!  Thanks for the recipe!

These burgers are quite good, and I especially like the chunks of onion and red pepper stirred into the meat. The only modification I made was that I didn't include the tomato, and I threw some Cajun seasoning salt into both the sauteed veggies and the chicken meat. I also cooked the burgers inside on a frying pan, and I really liked the results. I really don't understand some of the other reviewers problems... it might be the cooking, not the recipe. This would be an excellent way to spice up your next attempt at plain-ol hamburgers!

This was just OK.  I cooked the burgers for 5 minutes on each side and they were a little dry.  Maybe a few more veggies would have helped.  I didn't have the Old Bay Seasoning and added lemon pepper seasoning instead.  That might have made a difference.

Made these for a party last evening and tripled the recipe.  What a great alternative the old standard hamburger.  These had wonderful flavor and were a great hit!  Definitely not enough bread crumbs, so I added some torn bread pieces to get them to a good consistency for patty making.  These are yummy with ranch dressing or dijon mustard.  I couple of my guests requested to take the leftovers home. :)

These turned out fantastic & juicy! I added some cayenne pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder to mine for an added kick. These tasted even better the day after, so I think the key is to let them cool a bit after cooking.

These are great!  Freezing before grilling helps them not stick. They can go straight from your freezer to the grill, no problem.  Plus you can make a big batch to freeze and only take out what you need. Lay your patties on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper and pop in the freezer. Once frozen, transfer to large ziploc bag if you wish.

Great recipe and huge hit with my husband! I love all the veggies that are packed into this burger. I couldn't find Old Bay seasoning so I used Stubb's chicken seasoning. May use a bit more next time. I broiled instead of grilled and they needed 4-5 mins per side. Next time I may squeeze the veggies after sautéing them to reduce the liquid in the burgers.

These tasted okay and I'm glad I made them, may family enjoyed them.  But....the Old Bay really dominates the entire flavor profile and I guess I don't  prefer that, especially in a chicken recipe.

To start out, I had an unknown weight or chicken, something around three or four lbs. so I upped most of the ingredients by a little. These burgers were such a hit around the grill. I put these at the pinnacle of the grilled burger chart, I mean wow! So much flavor and the carrots added a little crunch occasionally. I am glad I went with this recipe and will use this in the future no doubt!

We use this recipe every time we make chicken burgers.  I leave the tomatoes and mushrooms out because I don't like them personally, but I have sliced tomato or other toppings on the side.  The Old Bay seasoning is what makes the burger!  My 4 kids love them too.

Excellent flavor.  Need to watch the egg/bread crumb ration so they aren't soggy.  Also drain the vegetables well.

Yum.  I just happened to have leftover roasted veggies (carrots, onions, red potatoes, and red and yellow peppers and mushrooms) from last Sunday so I placed them in my food processor along with the ground chicken and rest of ingredients and dumped out the mix on a cookie sheet, shaped it into a loaf and baked it at 350 for an hour.  After it cooled, I sliced it and put a slice on a hoagie  whole wheat bun with ranch dressing with some salad lettuce, and MAN was it ever delish.  By the way, I didn't add the breadcrumbs because I actually just forgot to, but it held it's shape and the roasted veggies included some potatoes that probably helped add substance.  YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I loved this recipe.  Followed exactly, except I did roll in bread crumbs before flattening.  This helped hold a very wet mixture together and made it easier to mold into the burger shape.  Easy to make--could definitely alter to fit what you have in the fridge.  And my family from Da Man to the 9 year old loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Im not crazy for chicken burgers but these were amazing! Will be keeping this recipe! Did make a couple changes though. Used about half a red onion minced, 5 cloves of garlic, one tomatoe, one egg and the bread crumbs. Added a little garlic and onion powder and a bit of emerils chicken seasoning. Stayed together on the grill and came out great!

Ahhhhhhmazing! These were so delish! I wrote this recipe out on a recipe card to keep handy as well because they were amazing. I actually forgot ALL the seasoning, salt and pepper and they were still really good. Do I sound like I'm raving? Because I am. :) 5 stars. Even my 3 & 4 year old nieces ate every last bite!

Made these for the 4th of July -- what a hit! People were amazed that they were so moist and tasty. It's a boatload of veggies and I was worried that they would fall apart on the grill, but all went well. I used the food processor to process boneless, skinless chicken breasts, put on disposable food gloves and went to town mixing the ingredients together. A very nice addition to our grilling repertoire. Too much work for the day of, so I recommend prepping the day before.

Very good. 
Much juicer than the typical chicken or turkey burger.
 I did cut all vegetables into medium dice as chopped to me means pretty large pieces.   I also cooked all veggies with the Old Bay until most all the moisture had cooked away to help ensure a firmer patty.  I also did not add the egg and they held their shape very well. I did not grill them on a grill, but in grill pan with grate on non-stick foil  with holes punched for draining in oven on convection broil. 
Great, brown surface, internal temp about 165. Really juicy and good!

I love these patties didn't use a bun. I ate it with a spring salad. I shared them at a bbq and my family loved them. They are requested every time we have a bbq. The only thing I changed was I didn't toast the veggies and I grated my carrots.

Think I followed the recipe pretty closely, but my burgers were really bland.  Sometimes that happens, I guess.  I'm a really novice cook so it may well have been a mistake I'm not even aware of.  For one, I made on the stove-top. Sorry, Chicken.

Awesome recipe! I also made a few adjustments to mine based simply on ingredients I had/didn't have. A little less onion, garlic powder vs. whole, no tomatoes (to prevent a runnier burger), all-purpose seasoning (vs Old Bay) and ground turkey. Still pretty awesome. My father in law, who is a pretty hardcore red meat guy, even complimented me on them (he also had never had a turkey burger before). I really liked the flavor and the substance. I will absolutely make these again!

These were awesome!  And since we are on a heart smart diet I substituted panko bread crumbs & used egg whites.  You can load up on the veggies with these!  We also used portebella mushrooms as our buns!  Great dish & will be making again!

This recipe is perfect! It's easy to form into patties if you wet your hands a little. I have made these chicken burgers every summer on the grill. I drizzle them with a little vegetable oil first. They come out so juicy every time.

A good burger.  Almost like a veggie burger (I added more veggies than in the recipe).  This recipe makes a very juicy burger and is very healthy and works well for those on a 'clean-eating' diet.

These were delicious.  I was a little disappointed because they fell apart some on the grill.  Next time I think I'll add more bread crumbs and cut back a little bit on the veggies.  Hopefully that'll keep them together better.  Great flavor though and a nice change from regular burgers!

YUM! I made this on a night when it was just me and my husband - we both had two burgers and ate the leftovers for lunch the next day. The veggie mix really does the trick to keeping the meat (we used ground turkey instead of chicken) moist. The only thing I left out was the carrots because I didn't have them on hand.

this tastes so good! thx teri :)  i didn't change a thing, except to scale it down to 2 servings. i grill it on stove top and the patty stays its form. serve it like beef burger with ketchup and mustard. i seriously chopped up the veggie and cooked them like 10 mins till soft and dry, and they combine well with the chicken, even without the breadcrumb and egg.

These rate between a 3 and 4 stars. texture was more like meatloaf but flavor was pretty good.I followed the recipe exactly. I had to form them into patties right at the grill because it was very hard to work with/ moist and delicate but it actually ended up turning out pretty good. Once it cooked for about 6 mins it was easy to flip and set very well. If i make these again, i will use lean ground turkey or ground chicken breast.

This recipe has potential but as written it's unusable. The people that have had success with this as written must be using ground chicken breast or ground turkey . Ground chicken is very soft and it takes 4 times the amount of bread crumbs to come close to anything workable. I played around with this alot and wound up baking it as a loaf. It wound up just ok. The amount of binder you need to add to the chicken really detracts from the overall taste. But I really liked the flavors and will play with it some more.

I was really looking forward to making this, but I was in a hurry and didn't saute the vegetables first..  it didn't turn out as good as I think it would've been.  There wasn't enough flavor and the vegetables were pretty much still raw.  I don't think this is a fair review because of that, but I thought I'd warn against not cooking the veggies first.  Will update when I make again. =)

What a surprise these were great.  I did add a teaspoon of chicken bouillon while cooking the chicken.  The wife and friends loved the chicken burgers.  I thought these almost tasted as good as ground beef.  Great for low fat. Thank you

Excellent! I skipped the carrots and tomatoes and I only used 1lb of ground chicken (bought the all-breast kind) but I didn't decrease the egg/breadcrumb mixture. The burgers stayed together great! I cooked them on my griddle. They did take awhile to cook--maybe 30 minutes--and we ate late but they were worth the wait. I topped them with provolone cheese. I had honey mustard with mine, and hubby and son had mayo. Our picky toddler LOVED these!! I'm already being asked to make these again, and we just had them last night!! Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe!

these burgers are wonderful! i mashed some avacado with a tablespoon of fat free mayo.. yum. one quick tip.. for all the people who complained about the burger being goopy, if you line a small empty cottage cheese container with some plastic wrap, add enough chicken for one burger, cover and press down to get the air out, then refrigerate for a half hour, they stay together wonderfully and it cuts down on the carbs from all the extra breadcrumbs. you can even freeze them once wrapped so you can have these wonderful burgers anytime you want

This was a great recipe - thank you!  I already had decided to make Chicken Burgers and bought the ground chicken at the store earlier today.  Then I figured I would see if there were any inspiring recipes online.  Adding the veggies was great.  In addition to the carrots and bell pepper I add one celery plus freshly chopped parsely and dill.  Instead of the Old Bay Seasonings I added some Montreal Steak and Chicken seasonings....about 1 teaspoon of both.  Then I sauted mushrooms and onions and melted provolone cheese on top and topped the burgers on French Bread rolls.  Excellent! Healthy and delicious! Yum-oh!

I made these tonight and everyone, including my toddler, loved them.  I omitted the mushroom, tomato, and Old Bay seasoning and made 1/2 a recipe.  I added salt, pepper, and dried parsley.  And I also added almost double the amount of bread crumbs because it was too wet.
Came out fantastic.  Definitely will make again.

My fiancé & I love this!  I had a few modifications... I couldn't find ground chicken, so I used ground turkey, I didn't have any mushrooms or peppers on hand, and I used McCormick Season All instead of Old Bay.  My fiancé is a beef kind of guy and he really enjoyed this burger.  We'll be eating this all the time now!

I halved the recipe and still made 8 burgers. I used Italian seasoning instead of Old Bay (which I only use for seafood).  Next time I might add some cheese for more flavor.  Overall, a good cow-burger alternative!

Really tasty and a great way to sneak veggies into my little one. She loved them, too, and she's five. I halved the recipe, didn't have tomatoes and used a whole egg - a bit too soggy. Next time, I'll use only an egg white.
Made a nice sauce for it: a mix of mayo, ketchup and chipotle tabasco sauce. 
Re: Old Bay Seasoning for fellow Canadians: Made a mix of what I had available from this recipe: http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/old-bay-seasoning-copycat-189447#activity-feed 
Be cautious to grill low so they don't burn.
Will be making again for sure,

This was absolutely wonderful.  I will definitely make again and again.  My only change was that I left out the carrot, but I'm sure that will be a nice addition next time.  I also chopped up the mushrooms rather than leaving them sliced.

Very flavorful and good served with yellow mustard and provolone cheese on top.  In order for this recipe to work I had to use the food processor to grind up all of the veggies and drain a little moisture out of them to add to the chicken mixture.  Also, I doubled the fresh bread crumbs and even added some dry bread crumbs.  I think if I didn't make these changes the burgers would not form properly.  But....5 Stars for flavor.

This is a good basic recipe... I have played with it various ways after trying the original ...

First Versions; I substituted bread crumbs with cornflakes , chopped cilantro, onion powder, garlic powder, dash of hot paprika and a chopped habanero pepper... I topped it with avocado, and smoked cheese...Perfecto...

Second version : the ground cornflakes,  a white wine, a 1 teaspoon knorr chicken graound (to taste), and fresh chopped dill, ground mustard powder.. was deliciousa

These are an absolute favorite of mine! I usually have two at dinner and then freeze the other six patties. They reheat well in a pan and make a great quick lunch.

This recipe deserves more actually :D

After reading multiple reviews here, I concluded the following:

- Finely chopping the veges is best. It makes the chicken blend well with the veges. I used boneless chicken breast in the processor to grind them and then added the veges right after. I used about a 1/4 kg of chicken and used 1 onion+ carrot + green bells. They were all finely chopped and blended in well.

-Wet your hands when you form the patties. It really helps.

- Adding bread crumbs to the chicken mixture makes them hold well together.

They turned out very Moist and flavorful. I aimed for this recipe specifically because my husband isn't a fan l of veges and  HIS BODY NEEDS THEM! LOL 

What I loved the most about them is that chicken flavor remained dominant and the veges weren't that obvious.

Will definitely make again!

08/23/2017 We liked these and I will make these regularly since I buy a lot of ground chicken in place of beef.  (Like some others, I'm going to start grounding breast and freezing it, when it goes on sale!)  I  used a pound of ground chicken, halved the veges and kept the 1/2 c of bread crumbs.  We used cheddar, but I think a more mild cheese might have worked better. UPDATE 06/23/2019 A few tips I found helpful with these.  They are very agreeable with different additions as per your taste.  I've made them with Italian bread crumbs and parmesan grated cheese.  To better keep them together I formed them into patties on parchment paper, then laid them on a plate and put them in the freezer for an hour before grilling.  Also, make sure to oil your grill a bit so they won't stick.

It might help if the title were changed to "Pan-grilled Chicken Burgers."  While it's true what another cook said in her review about the patties being too tender to do well on a traditional wire grill, the texture makes for a very moist and tasty patty when grilled in a grill pan.  These were a huge hit with family and friends with several asking for the recipe.  I made a burger toppings bar and served these patties with assorted buns.  Everyone raved about how good these were!

These burgers were delicious as reviewed.

Only change would be to add more bread crumbs than what the reduced recipe calls for...I reduced to 4 serving and I would increase the bread crumbs from 1/2 to 3/4 or 1 cup.

I don't particularly think the kids enjoyed them as much as I did but I am sure they were already comparing them to regular beef burgers.  But "I" really like them!  And did not feel guilty afterwards.  They were not that easy to patty-up and was quite messy but the final product was flavorful and worth the effort.

I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I thought I had 2 lbs of ground chicken, but discovered, after I had all the other ingredients prepped, that I only had a little over a pound of chicken. Despite this, I went on, effectively including twice as many veggies as called for. I did cut back on the Old Bay seasoning because I was afraid it would be too strong.

Bottom line: it turned out great! The veggies provide good texture, and the flavor was very good. An exceptionally healthful recipe. Instead of frying the mixture as burgers, I decided to bake it in individual silicone muffin cups. Love those things! Nothing ..... and I mean nothing .... ever sticks to them. I baked them for 45 minutes at 350 degrees. 

With this approach, once cooled I could pop them in the freezer for a quick "grab & go" snack or breakfast. Just a brief warm up in the microwave, and they're ready to go. 

I'll be making these again.

These burgers are delicious- my adult daughter, who likes nothing,  will ask for these, and the rest of the family enjoys them too.

I made changes, to make due with the ingredients that I had on hand, and must say they still came out very good the second time I made them. I used a small green pepper along with half of a small red one.  Instead of a chopped tomato, I used two tablespoons of chunky medium salsa, and omitted The  Bay Seasoning since I didn't have any.

This has become a go-to receipe.  Thanks so much for sharing it!

This is so good.  I did add additional breadcrumbs so I used 1 cup total.   I didn't have mushrooms so I left that out.  I made little slider burgers with half and the other half made meatballs.  My 5 year old loved them.  Thanks so much for the delicious and healthy recipe.

Loved it! I made a couple changes, but I'd say the recipe is pretty darn good! I didn't have old bay spice, so I used what I had- nutmeg, ginger, allspice, ground mustard, celery salt and crushed red. My only complaint was that the burger stuck to the grill because of how sloppy it was. Fortunately it was salvageable. Next time I'll cook it a few minutes on foil to solidify. Other than that it was DELICIOUS!!! Definitely a keeper. I served with cheddar, spinach and tomato. No condiments needed! Yum!!

Love this recipe! Only change i made was use garlic powder instead of the Old Bays. (Not sure what it is). Hubs and my 20 month old loved them. Hubs even raved about it when he spoke to his mom and she requested the recipe and she said its a hit with her family as well. Thank you for submitting this yummy juicy burger recipe!!

These are my favorite grilled chicken burgers I make them all the time. I don't add the tomatoes. I also adjust the amount of seasonings and vegetables to my liking. I also form them into patties and put them in the refrigerator for a couple of hours for them to firm up, that way they hold up better when grilling! They are very moist and flavorful with  the added vegetables!

Yum. I didn't have old bay spice mix so I used Victorian Epicure chili lime seasoning. I wish I wasn't watching my weight because I'd sit down and eat another :)

I have used both chicken and ground turkey and I agree more bread crumbs are needed And I also omitted the carrots and mushrooms to suit the children's taste. Plus I used Old Bay garlic & herb. But over all  I agree it's a keeper to experiment with.

My husband and I both loved this recipe! We just ate the burger on top of a bed of spring mix salad. It was a super moist burger and tons of flavor. We both liked the touch of old bay seasoning. We will definitely be making it again.

Loved this recipe! Changed it a little: left out the seasioning and onion/garlic(not kid approved in my house) and saved the tomato to top the burger. Also served them on whole wheat sandwich thins with a thin slice of cheese and a side of garden salad. These were very filling! Even my husband who can plow through 2 regular hamburgers barely managed to finish 1 of these. And the kids ate them so I will be serving these again! I might even add some different/more veggies as this is a great recipe for sneaking them in without anybody noticing!

Amazing recipe - the patties were moist and succulent, all the kids loved it.....Pressed for time, I didn't even saute the vegetables - added a nice crunch and also I guess locked in the moisture from the veggies. This is definitely a keeper!!

These were AWESOME! I totally winged it and they still turned out great.  I took bits and pieces from other reviews and made it my own.  I cut out the carrots and mushrooms(since I had none on hand).  Used 1/2 a large red pepper chopped, 1 small zuchini shredded, 1 onion chopped, 2lbs of ground chicken, garlic, 1 box no name seasoned crutons blended in food processor instead of breadcrumbs(I just like the texture/flavour better than breadcrumbs), onion powder, and Weber's chicken seasoning(I think this is what made the recipe).  You can probably use any chicken seasoning. Oh, and some pepper and a dollop of dijon. I also used olive oil instead of cooking spray.  Anyhoo, threw them on the grill for 15 min or so, and presto-probably the best homemade burger I've ever had-jam packed with flavour and the texture was perfect. Not too mushy, not too dry. I literally ate them right out of the dish after they cooled. No toppings/condiments needed.

Excellent, this will become a staple dinner. Added finely chopped jalapeño, gave it a nice flavor and bite. Too hot to grill so put in skillet and it turned out wonderful.

My picky husband ate two of these so I think that's a pretty good endorsement. :)  I cut the recipe in half and followed instructions except for using garlic powder in place of raw garlic and not adding the diced tomato. Not "OMG" great, but they were tasty and a nice change of pace from our typical menu.

These are WONDERFUL.  Our whole family kind of turned up there noses and thought the worst.  Everyone LOVED them and had seconds.  We did put a small piece of swiss cheese on a few of them and it made them even better.  I did however use the same amount of almost everything except the ground chicken and I only had one lb so I used that and tripled the panko breadcrumbs to stretch it and added 2 eggs instead of one.  INCREDIBLE...is all we can say.

I made these burgers a long time ago and lost the recipe. Glad I found it again. I know about the burgers being delicate and falling apart. The way to solve this is to freeze them, then grill them from frozen state, works perfect. Now I need to find this "old bay seasoning". These burgers are truly a great substitude and so much healthier. My grandsons love them.

I really liked these.  I had to use a lot more bread crumbs than the recipe called for, but I loved all the veggies in the burger.  Very good and I will make these for myself and freeze the patties for when my husband gets in the mood to grill.  He wasn't really fond of them, but he's not a huge chicken fan.

Great! Loved by the kids and adults! I used a tablespoon or so of chicken broth while sauteing the veggies, just because they were a little too dry with just the cooking spray. We will definitely add these to the rotation! Thank you!

Healthy! However Needed a lot more seasoning, a little bland, but it's nice because I can use the left overs in pasta, soups, and in salads.  It was surprisingly solid with how much vegetables were added. I would add some soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce!

What a pleasant surprise!  We've grown up with Old Bay Seasoning, and I would have never  thought it would compliment the ground chicken that well.  Hubby grilled outside (we like a charcoal grill), and served with a tossed salad,and lots of chunky bleu cheese and hot sauce.  Our new favorite!!!

The best recipe I've ever made from allrecipes.com! I didn't have old bay seasoning and carrots on hand, so I simply omitted them. It was fine without. The husband and kids ate them up completely.

These were very tasty but a lot of prep. I cooked in an electric frying pan cause I ran out of fuel for bbq. Everyone enjoyed them.
Made again recently and although they are a little work, they turned out fabulous! Will make these rather than buy them frozen!

I made a few changes to the recipe. We don't like tomatoes so I cut those out. I did scale it down to four servings and added 1/4 cup cooked brown rice. I didn't have fresh peppers and mushrooms on hand only canned mushrooms and sweet roasted peppers. I also added a little extra breadcrumbs like some others said. The foil on the grill was a great idea also. The results were great. My twelve year old picky son even said these can go into the dinner rotation.

Our family really liked this, alhough mine didn't hold together as well as I liked so I might play with the mixture a bit next time. We used a little seasoned mayo, tomato and lettuce to top them off!

I tried these burgers with an unsure attitude, but found they were surprisingly delicious and flavorful! My family I made them for was also impressed.  I did have a slightly difficult time keeping them together, although it wasn't a serious problem - just a few veggies falling off here and there.  Also, I skipped sauteing the veggies and just put them in with the chicken raw - turned out just fine!

My whole family loved these! Next time we will try them with ground turkey for variety. We did not use the Old Bay seasoning and they still turned out great!

came out pretty good. I used turkey instead of chicken, because it was on sale. I also forgot the mushrooms, but these burgers were still super flavorful... I'd like some cool ideas for condiments for these burgers, though.

I made these with ground (white) turkey meat and left out the tomatos.  They're wonderful; very juicy and flavorful.  Will definately make again.

Delicious and juicy!
I omitted the carrots, peppers, and tomatoes and the egg, and added 1/2 can tomato sauce and it was so juicy!! My husband keeps asking for these for dinner!

Love this! it was very filling and I know is much healthier than beef/pork patties. 

I added a slice of Cheese on top and some cucumbers and it was good :)

My husband was skeptical the first time. Bue he liked them a lot.  And when I told him I was making them again today he was excited.  These really are fabulous burgers.  They don't hold together like a fatty hamburger, but if you're relatively delicate about it, they'll stay together okay.

I was looking for low-fat recipes and this turned out great.  Unfortunately it was so good I ate three burgers (so much for the diet)!  They were beautiful, moist, and flavorful.  I will be making again soon.
