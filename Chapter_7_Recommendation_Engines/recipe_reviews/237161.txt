Wow. Perfect as is for a traditional char siu, amazing flavours. I adapted it a little to our tastes but nothing drastic; Didn't use liquid smoke. Used thighs & drumsticks. Added 1t of cayenne, 1T of white sugar & a bit of cornflour to the sauce before basting & it was wonderful. My partner & his friend were raving about it, said it's the best Chinese chicken they've ever had :) I dipped my fries in the leftover sauce at the end too, yummy. Thank you for a perfect recipe - will be making this again & again :)

Turned out extremely well even despite not having every single ingredient. I didn't have liquid smoke or the Chinese 5 spice powder, so I just put paprika in place of the liquid smoke, and did the best I could about the spices. I did some fennel, cinnamon and just regular black peppercorn. Even without having the exact ingredients the other flavors really carried through with the 24 hour marinade. Will make again, next time with the spices and liquid smoke and I'm sure it'll turn out even better since it'll have a bit more heat. I also didn't bake them, I threw them on my charcoal grill and got a nice char on them making them extra tasty.

I made this for a pork loin marinade and it's excellent.  I left out the optional liquid smoke and think that was a good plan.  I also shorted the optional food colouring, but still got a nice red hue to the meat.  When I try again I'll go for the full 48 hours of marinating, as I think more is better in this case.  I think this would be good for any kind of poultry or pork.

12 11 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/237161/char-siu-chicken/ ... S liked; others said nothing. I didn't have Chinese Five  Spice so subbed with 1/4t cinnamon, pinch cloves & 1/16t each: anise extract, ground fennel seeds, black pepper. I did add the sherry & liquid smoke, but not the food coloring. The marinade smells more anisey/fennely than it tastes. Without fennel seeds, anise extract is a good sub.  I think a pineapple slice on top while baking would be good & somewhat help keep it from drying out .  This, surprisingly, isn't all that sweet; mild.  A little heat in the marinade would improve.  Sesame oil is a good friend to me, too.  :) ... Three days later, three pieces in the refrig still. :(

Delicious! I have made this with chicken thighs, chicken breast and even with pork loin and it has been successful each time! This is great as a dinner, or cut into chunks and put on skewers for a party food. It can be made as sweet and spicy as you are in teh mood for by adjusting the seasonings and spices to your preference. I will be making this again for sure, my friends just love it adn so do I.
