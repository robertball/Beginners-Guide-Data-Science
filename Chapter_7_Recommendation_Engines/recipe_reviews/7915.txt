OMG this is awesome good! It just doesn't get any better than this! I kept all measurements and ingredients the same, only adding 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter. It bakes to an almost cookie-like crunchiness on the top with a very moist and apple-y interior. I took it over the top by pouring over a caramel glaze: 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 c. brown sugar, and 1/4 c. cream. Bring to a boil, then boil 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Let cool just slightly before pouring over warm cake. Hubby says the "sauce" was what made this extraordinarily good, but this cake is so good, so delicious, a simple sprinkling of powdered sugar would be just fine too. I don't EVER want to lose this recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing it!

Thanks to all the other reviewers I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups as well as increasing the cinnamon to 3 tsps.  I also thinly sliced my apples and should have used 5 cups instead of 4.  I made an additional change - I beat the eggs and oil together until the eggs were a little frothy on top - about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.  I baked this in a glass pan for 40 minutes and the cake turned out quite light and moist.  Instead of greasing and flouring the pan I substituted cinnamon sugar for the flour.
For those of you who haven't tried this recipe - its WONDERFUL!!!!  Not overly sweet, just bites of apple-cinnamon heaven.

What a delicious cake. I used 3/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup oil in place of the cup of oil. I also cut the sugar to 1 cup for my diabetic mother and added 1 extra apple. Wow, it was excellent and devoured for afternoon tea. If this recipe makes 24 serves then I had about 5 serves in one sitting! I couldn't help myself. This has become a family favourite!

Wonderfu, wonderful, wonderful.  This is a regular in our rotation.  I usually increase the apples to 5 cups as my family likes more apples, but keep all other ingredients the same.  Unfortunately, this "cake" is never fully cooked at 45 minutes (probably due to the extra apples).  See most helpful hints from "naples34102" for a glaze that makes this cake go from divine to superb!

This cake is EXCELLENT!  I baked it in a bundt pan for 55 minutes and drizzled a sugar glaze (confectioner's sugar, vanilla, milk) over it.  It looked and smelled so good that my younger son couldn't bear for me to take it to our friends' house...and it tasted even better than it looked.

I think this cake is awesome!  My only regret is that I didn't taste it first without frosting.  I usually don't like cake without frosting so I immediately frosted it with a cream cheese frosting.  The cake beneath tastes so good (kind of has a crunchy top like crystalized sugar) that I am sure it would be good without the frosting.  Anyway, I did NOT make any changes to ingredients or cooking time and would not make any in the future.  I greased and floured the pan per the instructions and had NO trouble with sticking.  Perhaps the additional baking time is creating the sticking problem?  I planned on giving small plates of this away to my neighbors but now that I've tried it, it will be tempting to inhale it all myself!

This cake is INCREDIBLE!!!! First time I made it the cake didn’t last the day. Don’t change the ingredients it just takes away from the perfection, I’ve tried doing variations. 

Now, the downside. I’ve made this cake many, many times and noticed that it tends to get really moist as time goes on. Eat it FAST. The first day it’s perfect; crusty sweet top and moist mellow inside. The second day it tends to get moist with a wet sticky top and heavier inside. The third day it’s soggy, no other word for it. I don’t know why this happens, to this extreme. But when u have people around it doesn’t always last that long. The other problem I’ve had is that I can’t get the eggs and oil to beat until creamy.  They always end up looking like yellow liquid. I don’t know what happens there, maybe it’s because I’m using a stand mixer with a paddle? I’ve tried varying the time I mix from a little to a lot; the good news is the cake still comes out of the oven tasting unbelievable. This is one recipe you have to try!!!!!!

I tweaked this recipe a bit and the result was much lower in fat , healthier ,vegan AND  tastes richer than the original :) 
in place of 2 cups plain flour 
I used 1 cup of whole wheat and 1 cup of cake flour,
ener-g egg replacer instead of the 2 eggs,
1 cup of unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil ,
11/4 cup of dark brown sugar in place of 2 cups white and I added 1/2 cup of rum soaked raisins (i used whelers vannille') and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.
as the cake was cooling i made a simple glaze with powdered sugar ,whalers vanille and a dash of cinnamon .This cake was very good  and drew raves from my husband as well as visiting friends .

This cake was fantastic!  I cut the recipe in half to make a 9 inch square pan size.  I dusted the top with powdered sugar and had one piece with my husband.  At midnight I got up to go sneak another and it was all gone!!  My husband loved the density and simplicity of just a touch of cinnamon.  Yup, the dough is very thick and hard to work with, but don't thin with anything - you don't need to!

I made it exactly as written and it was absolutely amazing! Don't know why you would need to cut down on oil or sugar. It is perfect. The only thing I might change is to dice the apples into smaller chunks rather than slices, but that was my own fault. Excellent cake!

Exactly like the recipe says and a wonderful autumn cake. I used mealy apples and it still tasted wonderful. A small word of caution...be careful on your baking time. Just a few minutes too long make the edges crunchy. It doesn't ruin the taste but it will hurt the consistancy. Enjoy!

I have made this cake many times and just realized that I have not reviewed it. Opps...This recipe is definitely a keeper with just a few changes.  I used just a little over 1/2 cup of oil, 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar and about 5 cups of granny smith apples.  I also used a bundt pan and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on the inside, baked about 50 minutes. Everyone who had tried this has loved it.  Thanks!

Was so excited after reading all the reviews but this is undercooked mush. The outside burned before the inside was done. Very disappointing.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I put sugar instead of flour in the bottom of my pan...no sticking.  The top was nice and crunchy and the middle was so moist and delicious.  I used the caramel glaze suggested by another reviewer (1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/4 cream; boil 3 minutes; take off heat; add 1/2 tsp. vanilla; cool slightly and serve over cake) and the cake went from fabulous to sublime.  Wow.

This cake is so amazing. I have made it a couple of times now. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. It came out great, and my coworkers gobbled it all up. The second time, I was all out of white sugar, so I substituted it for brown sugar. It was awesome! I baked it in two 8-inch cake pans for about 25 minutes, so that I could have one cake for myself. :-)

OMG!!! Perhaps I should just glue the rest of this cake to my hips and butt...  But, that would be wasting the best apple cake I've ever had in my life.  Followed suggestions: 1/4 cup oil & 3/4 cup applesauce (Unsweetened). Reduced sugar to 1 cup (and tossed in less than 1/4 cup brown, too).  Used 4 1/2 cups PINK LADY apples, diced.  Added in more cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves (and a pinch of cake spice for some anise). Oh, I also sprinkled the Cinnamon Sugar over the PAM spray, instead of flouring (No sticking). As a whole, the cake was pretty darn good. But, I knew the husband wouldn't find it sweet enough, so I decided to take naples34102's advice for the caramel sauce.  That's what did it.  No words to say how amazing this cake is with her Caramel Sauce on top.  Wow.  Between me & the 4 year olds, DH will be LUCKY to have any left when he gets home from fishing trip tomorrow. Kudos To You, naples34102 - KUDOS!!!

Wow, just wow! I like this cake so much. For the first time I made it with a full cup of oil. And it was wonderful, very soft and melting in your mouth. And for the second time I substituted 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesause for oil. And this time the consistence came out a little bit firmer and not so melting. It was still good, but not as good as the cake with a full cup of oil. So if you don't care about your figure just don't change anything. This recipe is perfect without any frostings and custards.
Just take into account that if you use bundt or gugelhupf pan, this cake won't be very nice looking if you put your apples in all the batter. Put 1/3 of batter in your bundt pan and then add all the apples in the remaining 2/3 of batter (you can make also a layer of apples between pure batter on the bottom of the pan and batter with apples).
Both two times I baked this cake for 60 min. After 45 min. of baking a toothpick inserted in a cake is very moist.

Wonderful cake!  I never made a German Apple Cake before and this was so good.  I cut the recipe in half and made it in an 8x8 glass baking dish.  I used 1/4 c. of oil and 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I also used more apples - 3 cups.  It turned out very moist and delicious.  I also followed the advice from naples34102 and did a caramel sauce for over the top which was incredible - 1/4 c. butter, 1/4 c. brown sugar, and 1/8 c. cream (I used half and half instead).  I let that boil for 3 minutes, removed it from the heat and then added 1/4 tsp. of vanilla.  I poured it over warm cake - a perfect dessert.

This is the moistest cake I've ever eaten. It is fantastic! The only thing I do differently is substitute applesauce for the oil and add 5 cups of apples and 1 whole tablespoon of cinnamon. This goes so fast too. I bake it in a bundt pan and I don't ice it at all, just sift powdered sugar over it, more for looks than for any added taste.Thank you Barbara for the best apple cake recipe in the world in my humble opinion.

Love this recipe - didn't change a thing.  And it is so moist and tasty you really don't need a topping for it.  My hubby said that he could sit down with a glass of milk and a fork and eat the whole thing.

I made this in a bundt pan, and the baking time should've been closer to 55 minutes. Otherwise, it smelled wonderful and was a tasty, moist cake. I used four apples. I also made the caramel glaze suggested by naples.

I made this recipe exactly as stated last autumn and my B&B guests enjoyed it.  I left myself notes on some changes to try, and just got the recipe out for the first time this season.  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup of sugar, used golden delicious apples since they are on the sweeter side, and used 1/2 
oil and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I actually liked the coffee cake more since it was slightly less sweet.  I didn't miss the extra oil at all - and all the guests had seconds - always the sign of a successful baked good!   I will definitely make this recipe with the noted modifications a lot this fall.

This is super yummy! I made it for my boyfriend's father who has diabetes and other health concerns. To make it healthy for him I substituted the oil with applesauce, eggs with egg whites and the sugar with 1 1/2 cups splenda. I added about a tbsp of baking powder in addition to the soda to counteract the way splenda inhibits rising. It worked out wonderful and was absolutely delicious and you can't even tell its no fat, no cholesterol, no sugar added!

Heaven! Only thing I changed was to use 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of 2 cups. Doesn't even need a glaze. Super moist and delish. Thank you Barbara for sharing.

I love this cake. Great as is, yet there are so many ways to change this recipe up. nutmeg is great in this. I also add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon.  Sometimes I use 5 cups of apples and other times I add applesauce for part of the oil. Walnut oil is good in this and so healthy. I replace some of the AP  flour with stone ground whole wheat flour. It's great topped with many different things. Warm with ice cream, plain powdered sugar, a caramel glaze, creme anglaise, or a lightly sweetened thin layer of cream cheese frosting (my favorite). This is healthy enough to have cake for breakfast!

Yummy!!!! As with so many reviews, I cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups. That was just nice. Dusted with powdered sugar, it is lovely!

I had to bake this cake an extra 25 min, it was so wet in the middle....It is very very sweet.  Im shocked at how many people enjoyed this cake...I will not be making this again....If you are going to make this recipe please read over some of the other lower star ratings, you will see that A LOT of people have had a hard time with how wet this cake is....good luck!

I had never had German Apple Cake before. Oh. My. Goodness. I think my diet is in serious jeopardy because I kind of love this cake. Made exactly as stated except added about a cup more of apples and sliced thin rather than diced the apples. I did make one mistake - I made in a bundt pan instead of a 9x13 pan. The crust that I read about in some of the reviews was to die for and because I had to turn out my cake, it didn't stay all crunchy and crusty and wonderful like it would have had I made it in the 9x13 pan. I just dusted with powdered sugar, which is all I think it needs. Heavenly.

OMG, this cake is sooo good! I just made it and my husband and daugher can't get enough. I cut back on the oil like some suggested and used applesauce. It is one of my new favorite desserts.

You just can't get better than this.  I cannot wait to make this cake again.  It was by far the best apple cake my fiance and I have ever tasted.  

I took the suggestion of other reviewers and made the following adjustments:

used 1/4 cup of applesauce for the oil
substituted 1 cup of light brown sugar for the white suger.  Baked mine in a bundt pan for about 55 minutes.  Topped with the caramel glaze that Naples provided on her review from this recipe.

I used 4 cortland apples.  I find they are the right balance of sweetness without a lot of extra moisture when baked.  

The cake was extremely moist and not over the top sweet.  Perfection!!!

This was so delish. I just added the amount of cinnamon suggested, as well as an extra cup of apples. Then I used naples34102's suggestion of a caramel sauce of cream, b.sugar, and butter. I loved the caramel apple flavor. It was to die for! I would give this 10 stars if I could. I will make this again, and again, and again....

The reviews are in from my son's school - fantastic. Everyone wants the recipe. I did not have the honor of trying it - next time. But with reviews like this I will make again and soon! I made it in a bundt pan for about an hour. It came out so moist. I did put a caramel glaze as another reviewer suggested.

Beat the eggs first. Get them thick then add the oil.  Not sure if anyone shared that.  There are 700+ posts!   I made a lucky mistake of forgetting to add the sugar so I had to start over. concerned with my first batch because oil and eggs didn't get creamy I tried beating the eggs first for my do-over. That's  the trick!!!  

Cake did stick to pan. I used an earthenware bundt and added cinnamon and sugar to coat after the butter and flour. Not sure which was the stick-y cause. Thankfully just a dessert for home so presentation not a big deal. 

Overall, very tasty by following directions. Gave it four stars because directions should say..... Beat eggs. Add oil. Then add sugar.

Wow, this cake is really great. I baked half of the batter in a small cake pan and the other half as 12 cupcakes, both gave good results! We cannot stop eating it; it's so good. I did lower the oil to around 3/4 cup.

Excellent apple cake!  Moist and tasty.  I upped the spiciness by adding 1/2 tspn ground ginger, nutmeg & cardamon.  I did change it slightly for health, reducing sugar to 1+1/2 cup, and swapping 1/2 cup of oil for natural apple sauce.  Of course this was all negated when I poured caramel frosting over half of the cake!  :-)  Perfect cake with or without frosting, but it did lack the crispy crust other reviewers talked about - probably because of my reducing the sugar content.  Might try agaiin as a base for other fruits/vegitables - perhaps zuchinni/carrot or pears and nuts.

I love a good dence moist cake, and this one is perfect. It bakes best in a sheet pan because there is a lot of apple in this it tends to fall apart in a bundt pan unless you grease and flour you pan very well (cooking spray dose not cut it for this recipe) Also let you cake cool completely in a bundt pan. If you are making it in a sheet pan, a nice topping on it is simply sprinkle it with a bit of brown sugar before baking. Also very good served with hot rum sauce and ice cream.
UPDATE: I have changed the recipe to suit me..used only 1/2 cup of oil and 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white. I like it even more now with the changes.

This has become one of my favorite cakes.  I highly recommend it!  Followed the advice of others and dusted the pan with cinnamon and sugar when I greased it and it created a wonderfully sweet and slightly crispy exterior that complemented the cake beautifully!  Excellent recipe, Barbara!

The first time I made this, I told my step-son to try some and let me know how it was.  He told me it was great, and I guess I should have listened to him then- because an hour later I went to get a piece, and the whole cake was gone!  I did make it again, and tried it myself- this is a great cake!!  It is wonderful by itself, you don't need any icings or frostings

This was a very good recipe. It is not the easiest but it is not hard either. It just takes a little while to make. One thing I do suggest is that you spray pam on a metal spoon. Then you that to pour and spread into pan. It makes it a lot less messy. The batter will be extremely thick. but don't panic. Also the spoon does not have to be wooden. you can also use splenda in place of one of the cups of sugar like i did and it still taste fabulous, but it is more healthy. also instead of using the icing or confectioners sugar I used a confectioners icing. It tastes awesome with this cake. It keeps it more moist to. use a teaspoon of vanilla and two table spoons of water and a cup of confectioners sugar. I hope this helps some one.

This is the most moist cake i've ever baked!! I followed the recipe exactly except i grated half of my apples and diced the other half, and also added a teaspoon allspice. Wowww!! It's so moist! I can tell my cake is ready when i stick a knife in and a few moist crumbs stick to it, i like really moist cakes so i don't wait till it comes out completely clean(it wouldn't be super moist and soft). I baked it in a prepared(oiled and floured) bundt pan and it came out so pretty and perfect and the flavor is really great too! I bit into my piece and got a few bits of diced apple, mmmmm. I would definitely make this when having friends over since it's so amazing. I really wouldn't make any major changes to the recipe as it is already perfect. Except i might add a little bit more cinnamon and allspice next time since i like my apple cake really cinnamon-y. Anyways, today was my first time ever making apple cake and i'm so glad i used this recipe! I'm 13 and this is an amazingly simple and delicious fool proof recipe so i will used it many more times in the future to use up extra apples, or just when i need to have something beside my cup of tea(; P.S i had my cake plain since i couldn't wait, but this would go WONDERFULLY with some plain sugar glaze or freshly made apple syrup.

Make this cake!! This was so easy and so delicious. The only change I made was 1C white sugar and 1C brown sugar. Next time I'm going to sub 1/2 C applesauce and 1/2 C oil instead of 1C oil and I will try a little less sugar. For novice bakers like me, the original recipe is THE BOMB!

Really great apple cake, the only reason I'm giving it four stars is because I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, increased apple to 4 1/2 cups and reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  It was still incredibly moist and delicious, a great way to use up apples

Love this cake! Its so easy, too.  All I had were sweet Gala apples and I could have decreased the amount of sugar by half a cup and it still would have been sweet enough.  The apple texture turned out fine, too.  An easy cake with simple, autumnal flavors and, for the most part, budget friendly, too.  Thanks!

Followed recipe "as is" (not my style usually) - and it was a huge hit at family bbq last night.  I had an influx of apples recently & tried 3 cake recipes in 4 days - this was BY FAR the best of the 3.  I used a bundt pan & sugared, instead of flowered the pan - LOVED the crispy exterior paired with the moist, dense interior!!  Highly recommended!

Very moist and good. Easy to make. I am making it again today. I do use more apples than called for, only 3/4 cup of oil and 1 1/2 cups white sugar. I also bake it in a bundt pan and dust with powdered sugar.

Wow! What a wonderfully DELICIOUS cake!! It is simply moist on the inside and the topping has a slight crunchiness that I love. I used 2 granny smith apples, diced, equaling 4 cups. I followed the recipe with the exception of replacing the oil with cinnamon flavored applesause. I wanted to cut down on the oil. Mixing ingredients was easy with the hand mixer. Preheated oven and the baking time was approximate. I couldn't have asked for a more delectable moist apply-cinnmamony cake. Next time I might add a little more cinnamon to the batter. I dusted the cake off with powdered sugar. I also will try this cake again with Naples34102 Caramel Glaze. From what other reviewers wrote, this glaze was simply wonderful..can't wait to try it as well. This recipe is a definite keeper and go to again and again!!

This cake is divine.  The first two times I made it, it tasted great, but was a disaster.  I have had NO success making it in a bundt pan or as cupcakes.   However, if I heavily grease it and heavily flour it, it works GREAT in a 13x9 inch pan.  I just sprinkle it with powdered sugar.  It doesn't need icing at all.  Oh - and I didn't change a darn thing about the recipe.

YUM!!! I always love simple recipes that don't use boxed cake mixes, pudding mixes etc. This is such an excellent cake..tastes like something grandma would make. I cut the entire recipe in half and baked it in an 8x8 pan for about 40 mins. I used grape seed oil and half brown and half white sugar but didn't change anything else. Next time would probably reduce the sugar but if you like your cakes sweet then stick with the original. I also used granny smith apples because they hold their shape and I loved the chunks of apples loaded in every bite. One of the best apple cakes I have ever eaten..thanks so much for sharing!

I am rating the recipe exactly as written. Way too much sugar and oil.  The only positive was the crunchy outer crust of the cake.

Wonderful!  Are you supposed to wait for this to cool before you cut into it and eat it?!  Well, my family couldn't wait that long!  I made exactly as written and went ahead and topped it with Naples34102 suggested "sauce"!  Scrumptuous!  I was licking the spatula from the sauce and would have licked the pan I cooked it in, if I could have gotten my face in there!!  Wonderful recipe!  Thank you Barbara! :)

WOW!!  This cake was great.  So moist and flavorful.  I kept all the measurements the same and used fuji apples (4 large).  The cake recipe is great as is. But, I added the caramel drizzle another reviewer recommended and that sent the cake over the top!  Really, it was amazing!  I'm glad we had company to help eat it or I would have finished it off.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Soooo good! I cut the recipe in half and used 8" square pan, used same amount of cinnamon applesauce in place of oil and substituted Splenda for sugar at equal amount. I used 2 large apples, diced. I dusted the pan with cinnamon/sugar after spraying with cooking spray and dusting with flour. I sprinkled a bit more on top before baking. With the smaller pan, it was done after about 35 minutes. So moist and flavorful!!

Excellent! This is everything you'd want in an apple cake - moist and packed with flavor. To cut calories, I used 1/3 c. oil, and 2/3 c. applesauce. I also added 1 tsp. each of nutmeg and cloves.

I couldn't be happier with how this cake turned out.  It baked perfectly with the directions provided and was moist and delicious.  I added a bit extra vanilla and was generous with the cinnamon…smells amazing as it's baking.  I was a bit concerned the batter was so thick but to my pleasant surprise it cooked so nicely and thoroughly while staying moist. I will make this one again.

I think this has potential.  But made as written and it was way too sweet, wet inside that won't cook, crunchy on top, and it needs major changes.  Definitely cut down on the oil and sugar.  Definitely bake it in a bundt pan.  If you look at the photos you will notice a more cake like consistency in the bundt cakes.  The 9x13 pan resulted in a gooey cookie bar consistency.  I think it needs more flour also.  I also did not care for Naples caramel glaze, it was too buttery tasting and not like caramel at all...

I make this cake several times every fall with apples from the local orchard.  I usually use McIntosh.  They cook nicely in this cake.  One change I do make though is to use 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar.  Turns out wonderful every time!

I made the cake exactly as written and found it to be too mushy, oily, and too sweet. The flavor was good, but I did not like the consistency. If I were to make this again I would use half the amount of oil and some applesauce, and less sugar. Not impressed.

Made this once and it was awesome! I did make it agin last night and used Granny Smith's because they are so delicously tart they balance the sweet and cinnamon flavors so nicely. I also used 1 cup wheat flour and 1 white flour, and cut the sugar by a half cup and then used part white and brown sugar (I love how brown sugar tastes with apples). I added some ginger witht the spices too, because I think it compliments apples and cinnamon really well. It is a delicous cake as is but I made my changes and loved it even more.

this cake is excellent. i substituted 1/2c of applesauce for 1/2c of oil to decrease the fat content.  in the finished product i thought i could have added another cup of apples, but it was still quite good as is.  i made a cream cheese glaze that i drizzled over the top once the cake was cool. the icing was great, but i think the cake would be fine alone too.  thanks for a great recipe!

AMAZING!!!! i made this with changes9 (as follows)- 3/4 cup brown sugar/3/4 cup olive/1/2 cup apple sauce/2 eggs/1 eggwhite/2tsp vanilla/3 tspn cinnamon/1 tspn ginger/ 1 cup spelt flour/1 cup unbleached flour/ zest of 2 lemons/...
I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the apples. I blended the wet ingredients in a blender until completely until dissolved, i tasted it and it tasted like carmel 8)...... i make sure to taste cake batter before baking to ensure it wont be a nasty surprise.ahahhaha make sure it cools off after u bake it or else it will be too strong w the cinnamon, but after it cools off it tastes amazing!!!!! DONT FORGET TO ADD walnuts and pecans on top of the batter before baking, it makes for the most amazingl toasty flavors!!!! i dont ever frost this cake because its too  amazing, but it would taste good anyways

My daughter had to cook something German for a school project and, after searching online, settled on this recipe.  The only changes I made were to reduce the sugar by half a cup, as I felt the apples would add to the sweetness.  As a family, we don't like too much cinnamon, so I added half the amount.  This was perfect for us.  I baked it in two 8" square pans, so my daughter could take one to school and one could be left for the family to enjoy at home.  I changed nothing else and the cake was moist and delicious.  It was a hit for my daughter at school and the family loved it too. The juices from the apples did make the cake more moist by day two, but the cake didn't last longer than that so I didn't know whether it would have got really soggy or not.  This is a good recipe and I will be making it again.

This is the perfect go to cake for any occasion, whether coffee with the girls or dessert for a family dinner.  My girls are picky eaters and can't get enough of this cake.  It is indeed extremely moist and keeps well for several days (if you make enough).  I kept all the measurements but for substituting 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 of the cup of oil and cut the sugar in half, using 1 cup of sugar.  This is a fabulous cake.

I halved the recipe and just made it in a 9 in round pan.  I baked it for about 25-30 mins.  I added a little more cinnamon and vanilla.  Very good - my 2 boys and husband really liked it.

Absolutely delicious! Halved the recipe and baked in a small bunt pan @ 350 for 45 minutes. Replaced ALL the oil with cinnamon applesauce, doubled the cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (recipe from this site) for more flavor. In 1/2 recipe I used 3 granny smith apples. Made the caramel glaze suggested by naples and it really made the cake. I will *definitely* make this again!!!

This is an awesome recipe! I have been making it for years! Got the recipe from my German Grandmother. I make it exactly as you have listed except I add a bit more Vanilla. To assist the cake baking evenly I like to put an inverted Flower Nail in the middle of the pan before I pour the batter in.

Made EXACTLY as written, the first time, in a bunt pan - it was AWESOME. my husband is severely allergic to milk/lactose so i had been looking for a half decent non dairy cake recipe for a while. It was a huge hit and he scoffed it all up in no time.  The Second time I made a few changes - not because there was anything wrong with the recipe, but because my baby daughter loved it so I wanted to make it healthier for her: a) I used all whole wheat flour  b) subbed half apple sauce for oil  c) reduced sugar by half.... the result was still loved by all!

Loved how this turned out BUT it is VERY VERY sweet! I took the suggestion of putting cream cheese frosting on it, and it was over kill. The cake is sweet enough on it's own that i would suggest sprinkling with powder sugar and that's it! Without this icing, it's a GREAT cake. Everyone categorized it close to a coffee cake. Will make again (minus the frosting!!) Thanks for the recipe!

I cut back the oil by a 1/4 cup and cut the sugar in half because I don't like excessive sweet. However, I do drizzle on a caramel glaze.  I always bake this in a bundt pan! 55 mins does the trick --make sure to grease & flour your pan.

Fantastic recipe! Moist, flavour packed and simple. 
I've made it three times; twice as is and the third with raisins, nutmeg, allspice, and a dash of rum flavouring. It's amazing either way. Even better served warm with vanilla bean ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. Thank you!

I had 3 large apples that weren't that good for eating so I decided to make this cake. I used 1/2 c melted butter and 1/2 c fat free sour cream for the oil. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, used half white and half brown. I also used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 2 tsps baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda. I used half all purpose and half whole wheat flour as well. I baked in a 9x9 pan, 43 minutes was perfect in my oven. My family really enjoyed this cake, it was light and fluffy and nicely spiced.

This recipe is fantastic! I used about 5 cups of granny smith apples. Following the advice of others, I used a little over 1/4 cup of oil and 1 1/2 cups of sugar. And if you use the caramel sauce from naples34102, prepare to me amazed!

The cake was moist, dense, and tasty! I used two 8" round cake pan and it only took about 25 min to bake. I guess because it was meant to be so dense that despite my additional 1 tsp of baking powder, the cake was still quite flat. I chopped the apples into really small pieces so they they don't sink too much. I used 1/2 c of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce and cut sugar 0.5 cup (because I used some additoinal filling and frosting, they kept the cake sweet enough). Layered the cake with apple pie filling (apple pieces + lemon juice + sugar + raisins) and topped with cream cheese frosting (cream cheese + butter + cream + sugar) with sprinkle of toasted walnut pieces. What a wonderful cake it turned out to be!

OMG!!  This is SOOOO delicious!!  I sliced the apples instead of chopped and they were very tender and perfect softness.  I used Splenda half and the cake turned out so good.  I may try with 1.5 cups of sugar the next time.  Nake sure NOT TO use a angel food cake pan though.  The cake wasn't as dense as I expected so it broke as I turned the cake upside down.

It was probably me..... but I don't know how. I made this cake and no matter how long I baked it, it still seemed uncooked. The flavor was good, but the texture was way off. The ONLY change I made was to add about an extra half cup of apples. I wish I could give this a better rating!

This cake is really good. I used 1c sugar, 1/2c oil and 1/2c apple sauce. The sweetness was just right because I used granny smith apples, which were a little tart. I dusted with powdered sugar and voila!

I made this as written, didn't change anything. It was okay -- the best thing I can say about it is that you probably have all the ingredients on hand. The end result was kind of flat, and got a bit mushy by the second day. Flavour-wise I had no complaints, but as a "cake" it didn't really work. More like apple bars (which I ended up serving with ice cream).

This cake has very good flavor, but it's just too dense & moist.  I have made this recipe twice, but perhaps it just isn't a good recipe for high altitude baking.  If I were to try this again I would reduce the amount of oil/applesauce or add some flour.  The cake needed to bake for an additional 11 minutes to get it to test done, but it is just really wet.

If you are looking for an ordinary apple cake, this is the recipe for you. The cake was moist and had a good apple flavor. The outside wasn't really crunchy like some viewers mentioned. It was moist inside and out. I was going to add a streusel topping but I wanted to try the original recipe at least once. The only changes I made were 1 1/2 teas of vanilla and reduced the veggie oil to 3/4 cup, nothing else. I baked it for an hour and 10 mins, my small oven takes it bit longer to bake. Something was missing every bite I took. I think a crunchy topping would make it much better, streusel or cinnamon/sugar. I will tweak the recipe and definitely add a crunchy topping if I make this again. It was missing something...

My family loved it! I used about 5 cups of diced apples, reduced Canola oil to 1/2 cup, used 1 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown. Baked for 55 minutes in a bundt pan. VERY moist cake!

This tasted pretty good but I don't know that I would make it again.  I did slice the apples instead of cubing them.  It did get very soggy after each day passed on.  I think you could cut out a lot of oil in it and just let the apples give it the moisture.  I made it in a bundt pan.  The top had a nice crispy crust and was nice and moist.  Again, tasted good...just not sure it's a keeper.

made this for dessert with an entire german themed meal.  weisswurst, spaetzle, sauerkraute, and this for dessert.  delish!  i decided to make a cream cheese frosting for it because it was for a bday celebration & made it into 2 8" layers, & only iced the middle & top, leaving cake exposed on sides.  looked homemade, which equals downhome & made with love.  very moist, very apple-y, cinnamon-y & fall-y.  cake was great on it's own, so with or without icing, it's super tasty! will make again, i don't even need a birthday or oktoberfest as an excuse!

Very moist and delicious! Just be sure to cool the cake completely before flipping it over onto a plate- the cake will break apart since it's so moist. Excellent cake, I could've eaten the batter on its own! Will definitely make again.

I love apple cakes! They are a big hit with the whole family. I pretty much followed the recipe.  I have started using cake flour for my cakes, to see if I like it better. I do! My only mistake with this recipe was deciding to bake it in a bundt pan that I coated in oil and sprinkled with sugar rather than flour......Nice idea in theory. It stuck so bad  to the pan that I had to spoon it out. On the upside, the crystallized sugar made a delicious, sticky crustiness on the outside of the cake.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and even though it was a little too sweet, it was still very delicious.  The next time I make it (and I WILL be making this again), I'll try cutting the sugar in half and see how it turns out.  I made this cake last night and because many reviewers seemed to complain about the cake becoming mushy or soggy if not consumed within a day, I stored it in the refrigerator and the consistency is still good today.  We'll see if it gets soggy or mushy tomorrow...

This recipe, this cake, is FANTASTIC! I mean I am good, really  have only mastered one thing REALLY well, but now I have this too. I wish I could save the cake I just baked in a time box. Anyway, it was GREAT! But I did it slightly differently.  I recommend (if I do say so myself), pouring 1/3 of the plain batter into the bottom of the tin, then adding the apple pieces to the remaining 2/3s of the batter and adding about 1/3 of a cup of brown sugar, then pouring the apple-brownsugary-batter on top and cooking for more like 47 minutes.

Excellent! I made this according to the directions and it is perfection. I baked it in a bundt pan and it took about 55 minutes. I then used naples34102's glaze suggestion. Next time I may use Caramel Frosting I from this site. It would also be great!

This cake is fantastic!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and I thought it turned out perfect.  I like how the top of the cake has a slight crunch to it.  I also sprinkled a dusting of powdered sugar on top.  Everybody loved it!!

This is the first time that I've made an apple cake, and I don't think I'll make one again, at least not this one.  Followed the recipe exactly, even baked it in a 13X9 pan, but for 50 mins. What I ended up with was an almost bread pudding-like consistency, with apples. I can't imagine what it will be like by tomorrow. I purposely didn't top with anything because I wanted to taste the only the cake. I didn't find it to be all that flavorful. I have made many a cake professionally and don't understand what all the fuss is about this cake. I was planning on making this for Thanksgiving and I'm sooo glad that I tried it at home first. Guess I'll keep looking.

I've made this cake several times now and it's been a huge hit every time.  I generally use 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  Sometimes I make a cream cheese frosting and sometimes I just dust with powdered sugar - quite delicious either way.  This is a favortie cake for my little kids!

This cake is to die for!!  OMG, it is heavenly! I have always been a fan of apple cake, and this one is the best! I made a caramel glaze and this took it over the top. My son could not get enough of it. Definitely a keeper!!  Thanks!!!

Yum, yum, yum!  This was such a great cake.  My 3 year old daughter saw a cartoon drawing of an apple cake and wanted to make one.  I chose this one, and we weren't disappointed.  It was very delicious.  We iced it with a cream cheese icing.  It was so good that I kept picking at it.  So I wouldn't eat the whole thing...I took it to my mother's house for her and my dad to eat it up!

This cake is so moist and yummy! It turns out just like "Nanna Apple Cake" from Tastefully Simple that cost 8 dollars, and only makes an 8x8 pan. I love the crunchy top. I've made this with whole wheat flour and it turns out great, but I think it tastes better with regular white flour.  Enjoy!

This cake was pretty easy to make and everyone loved it.  I made this for my 1st grader's school party.  The teachers said it was waisted on the kids though.  Something about 6 year olds not appreciating good food?  I had to make it again because I didn't even get any.  Thanks for the recipe!

Mmmm, this cake was amazing!  Very apple-y.  I followed the directions, only I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown.  I also used the glaze another reviewer made --boil 1/4c cream, 1/2c brown sugar, 1 stick butter for 3 min, take off heat and add 1/2tsp vanilla and then cool a little.  My in-laws LOVED it.

I gave it 5, although I read the reviews and tweaked it. It's an amazingly delicious recipe! I used applesauce, as many suggested, 1 cup white flour and 1 cup wheat flour, reduced sugar to 1 cup and added ground cloves (about 1/2 teaspoon). I also, cinnamon-sugared a bundt pan instead of flouring it. 
Topped it with the suggested caramel sauce....YUUUUMMMM!!!! To die for, and everyone wants the recipe!

This cake seems so simple when you make it, but it has the nicest smell and flavor.  I made it in a bundt pan (cooked around 50 mins) and used cinnamon/powdered sugar instead of flour after the cooking spray.  After cooling, I poured a glaze made with 1/3 c. melted butter, 2 c. powdered sugar, 1.5 t. vanilla, and 2.5 T. water over it.  It tasted like a giant non-fried glazed apple donut.  Delicious!

I used 5 good sized MacIntosh apples and I also added a touch of nutmeg.  Very good!  Very moist, loads of apples, full of flavor.  Topped it with Caramel frosting from this web site.  Delish!

WOW!VERY VERY moist!! You really dont need a glaze. Because, its sooo moist. But, I tried it both ways and both ways were EXCELLENT! 
Just be aware that the batter does come out extremely thick. But, that is the way its supposed to be. So, dont freak. Cuz, if it didnt say it in the recipe. I almost thought I did something wrong. ;)

I have been making a nearly identical recipe for years. It's good with a very thin glaze. ( Try using 1/2 cup, or more, of boiling water, 1 cup of confec. sugar,+ 1 tsp. orange juice) Pour the glaze over the cake, while the cake is still warm. The glaze soaks in and makes it even more delcious.

Made it just as is, and it was just fabulous! So simple and so delicious. I didn't measure the apples, and maybe used a little more than 4 cups ... but it was great. Apple Pie Cake. 45 minutes wasn't quite long enough in my oven ...

This cake is awesome. We went apple picking yesterday and got half a bushel of Cortlands.I wanted to try something different with our pick. This cake is so good it's only been out of the oven for 30 minutes or so and it's half gone. I followed the recipe exactly, but did make a caramel sauce to pour over each individual piece. I will definitely make this again......often.

I rated this a four because I did follow several of the other reviewers suggestions. I used 1/4 C. oil and 3/4 C. applesauce, 1 1/2 C. sugar, 2 t. vanilla, 3 t. cinnamon and 2 t. pumpkin pie spices. That being said, the resulting cake was fabulous. I dusted it with powdered sugar and it was just sweet enough. This is definitely going on the list of favorite desserts at our house. Thanks so much for sharing it!

I own a coffeeshop/bakery, and made this cake today. The only change I made was that I added crumb topping. My customers raved about it all day, (I put out samples)begged me for the recipe, and bought it all! I will DEFINITELY be making this cake again!!

Delicious!  Used Granny Smith apples and followed recipe exactly.  Have made 3 times in past 2 weeks - once for my husband and I and made 2 for a Oktoberfest party in my neighborhood.  Everyone has asked for the recipe.

Delightful! Wonderful texture and flavor. Second time I used the 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce and used Bundt pan. Used Cortland apples, very easy to put together and the results are delicious!

Absolutely delicious.  Not as heavy as a Jewish Apple Cake.  Would highly recommend.  Liked the 9x13 size pan.  Lended itself well to smaller size pieces.

Excellent cake.  Very moist.  I made a few changes to make the recipe my own. :)  I added about a 1/4 cup of applesauce and used 1 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I used 4 apples and it came out perfectly.

The first time you make this cake you may think the batter is wrong.  It is as thick as playdough and very difficult to manage.  But the payoff is amazing.  Moist, good balance of flavors, keeps very well.

This recipe was easy and really good. I found two medium apples and 1 small were plenty for this cake. Tastes great w/out nuts. I also made a quick glaze with 2 tbs butter, 1/4 of milk and 1/4 c brown sugar and poured this over the cake while both were still hot. Excellent.

Had our first piece right out of the oven.  My husband said it was divine!  He was talking about it 30 minutes after we ate it!  I used the suggestion to only use 1/2 cup oil and 1 1/2 cups sugar and to put half the batter in an 8x8 pan and the other half for 10 cupcakes.  I had planned on freezing the cupcakes, but I don't think they'll hang around long enough to get into the freezer!  I drizzled some icing I made with ~1 1/2 T. margarine, ~1/3 c. powdered sugar, and ~1/4 tsp. almond extract.  (I didn't measure to make the icing; modify to taste.)  I'll be making this again!

Absolutely delicious cake! Goes very well w/ the suggested cream cheese frosting. However, do use just a little less than 1/2 c of oil, otherwise it's too moist and sticks to the bottom of the pan. My favourite recipe so far ^_^

I made this for a holiday luncheon at my work.  Like one other reviewer suggested, I only used 1/2 cup of oil, and replaced the other 1/2 cup with orange juice.  Good thing I did because I had to make this the night before, & the next morning it was pretty dense.  I think if I had used a whole cup of oil, it would have been a big gushy lump by the next day.

Also, some things I messed up on were that I forgot to add the baking soda, and I mistook the 4 cups of apples for 4 WHOLE apples, which was a whole lotta apples.  I added all but a handful.  So my cake wound up being more like apple pie without the crust.  That wasn't so bad though, because I like a lot of apples in my pies.

Regardless of everything, this cake was VERY YUMMY.  I did have to bake it just shy of 1 hour, but maybe that was because I added to many apples.  My husband who isn't a cake eater loved it & asked that I make one for home.  My 18 month old son (the only fruit he eats is watermelon & blueberries) ate up a whole piece.  And everyone at work loved it.  Someone even asked me for the recipe.  This would probably be scrumptious warmed up & topped with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I liked this recipe but my boyfriend and friends absolutely loved it. I only used half the oil and replaced the other half with orange juice. It definitely tasted way better after sitting out for a few hours- and even better the next day.

Had to bake it 15 minutes longer. Too moist but it tasted great and was not too sweet. Had to scrape the bottom of the pan to get the cake out because the cake was too moist and stuck to the bottom.

I would give this one a 5 star +  - I think it is a keeper!  I put it in my large glass pie plates and it looks very nice(bake a few minutes less).

After chopping and peeling the apples, I dusted them with cinnamon, and then poured 2 shots of rum over the apples. Then I put it all in a large freezer ziplock bag and let it sit for an hour, mixing it every few min to coat it evenly.  Turned out great.

Absolutely delicious.  A perfect Fall/Winter cake that will now be my go to recipe.  It was the end of November, after Thanksgiving, everyone was in the Christmas mood and I just was not finished enjoying the Autumn.....my favorite season, so I decided to look for a dessert that summed up that feeling.  I found it.  I had never made a German Apple Cake, but I'm part German, I  love apples, and I love to bake new things.  I did not change the recipe at all, other than using 5 apples instead of 4 as mine were not  that large.  I also think the type of apple that you use makes a difference, and I used my favorite, Honeycrisp.  How you cut your apple will affect it as well.  I do not like chunks of anything really, I prefer sliced so I thinkly sliced my apples .  The last thing that I think made it perfect was liberally buttering the entire bundt pan, every inch, and then coating  the entire bundt  pan with a liberal amount of a cinnamon/sugar mixture, which added an absolutely mouth watering sugar crunch to it the entire exterior of the cake.   It was a rich, dense cake, incredibly moist and the level of sweetness was perfect , a great cake for breakfast, after dinner with coffee etc...I ate the entire thing by myself and it lasted an entire week.  I would say this would make a great cake for taking to an office function, dinner with friends, ar any large group as it feeds a lot of people since you really cannot eat that much of it.  I read reviews and I did make a caramel sauce

This was a tasty, thick cake that makes a beautiful presentation. Changes I made were cutting the serving size to 12 and modified that ingredient list to make it a healthier cake--subbed applesauce for oil, used only 1/2 cup sugar (mostly all brown, about 2 tbsp of white) and whole wheat flour. I dusted the pan with flour, brown sugar and cinnamon. The final coat of powdered sugar added a nice sweetness. Note: I'm sure this recipe with the original ingredients is very tasty. These modifications I tried produce a fruit cake that is good for people who don't have a super sweet tooth and prefer healthier ingredients in their desserts. Additional ideas for making the healthier recipe a bit sweeter are adding a dollop of honey or serving warm with butter and preserves.

Super easy recipe!  Delicious results!  This recipe is very similar to the "One Bowl Apple Cake" I've seen on Facebook.  Following other reviewers suggestions I made a couple of changes.  1 1/2c sugar, 1/2c oil, 2 heaping tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger.  The directions on the FB recipe instruct you to mix together the sugar, egg, oil, and spices in a large bowl.  Add the apples directly to the wet mixture as you cut them up to prevent browning.  After all the apples were added, I sprinkled the dry ingredients over the top and mixed together till the flour was absorbed.  I didn't experience the super thick batter other reviewers describe.  Next time I'll try the 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar mixture for more depth of flavor.  Definitely a keeper!

I have made this cake several times now. It is perfect as written. Sometimes I will use half white and half brown sugar but the results are pretty much the same either way. You can cut down on the sugar if your apples are not too tart but I would be careful not to cut it too much and cause the cake to be tasteless. It is great without any topping but you can add a cinnamon and sugar topping before baking and it is very good.
Because of the apple I put the cover on the cake pan and put it in the refrigerator after it cools and it seems to keep better. I think it is even better the second day as the apple starts to mix into the cake more. I have rarely had much left by the third day but if kept in the refrigerator it should taste just as good even if the apple and cake are more combined.

Okay.  I tried this for the first time in our german pot luck get together just last Friday, 10/3/14.  I baked it a night before and didn't taste it but I was actually confident it tasted great.  
Nothing remains in the potluck, I actually tasted only a slice because it is that goooddddd!!! My gym friends said it was so moist and they thought I bought it in a deli pastry house...what???  I said, I made it from scratch from allrecipes.com lol.
So, since I only tasted one slice of the cake, I baked it again last night 10/5/14, with a twist.  I added pecans and 2 tablespoonful of almond milk but I changed the vegetable oil to 3/4 cup only and sugar to 1 3/4 cups. Still it was amazing and more moist.
I used Cool Whipped Frosting for more decadent taste...wow!  This is a keeper!

Absolutely DELICIOUS! Sooo moist and delectable, especially with naples34102's caramel sauce! It was maybe a little sweet for my liking so I'll cut the sugar next time, but the texture and the cinnamony taste was heavenly. After I took it out of the oven I was worried because it wouldn't set, but I realized that was just because of how moist it was :) thanks for the amazing recipe!!

Great recipe. I baked it in a bundt pan at 325 for nearly an hour. Only changes I made were to substitute 1/2 the oil with apple sauce and to add in an extra cup of apples. Also added the caramel sauce mentioned in another review (1/2 C Brown Sugar, 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 c. cream); but could have cut the sauce down. The sauce is a great addition, but I don't think it is essential. The cake is amazing all on its own.

A new family favorite! I followed other reviews and used only 1/2 cup of oil, 1-1/2 cups of sugar, 5 cups of apples and instead of flour after greasing the pan I used cinnamon sugar! This cake is absolutely wonderful...so moist and delicious!

Used this for Sunday school. Everybody loved it.I know where the"soupy" comment came from.It was hard to tell when its done. An outer crust forms that makes the toothpick test kind of hard to perform. Went an hour and could of probably gone another 10 min.

This cake turned out amazing! As suggested by other users, I reduced the oil to half a cup. I used half cup white sugar and half cup brown sugar and granny smith apples. I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I baked it in a 9.5 inch pie pan. The cake was a little too sweet. Maybe will reduce the sugar even more. Otherwise, the cake was really moist and apple-y. Husband said it was as good as bakery bought. And i trust his cake judgement. ;)

Fantastic recipe. I reduced the sugar by a small bit (but that's just preference - I do that with almost all cake recipes) and increased the apple by about 1/2 a cup because we had lots of apples to use... and wow! Wonderful cake. We had company and gave some slices away to friends and neighbours (11 different people tried it) and everyone LOVED it. Great slightly-crunchy outside with a moist inside. The cake flavours are a perfect pairing to the apples. Perfect with just a light dusting of powdered sugar. Thanks for posting!

I made this today with apples from one of the "wild" trees that grows on our property. I have to admit I didn't measure how many apples I used...I have so many I want to use up so I just added and added! It came out great and the kids loved it. I did change it a bit as I used 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce but I do that for pretty much any dessert type bread/cake I make. I didn't bother frosting it...I don't think it needs any. I will make this again for sure!

too bad I didn't read the critical reviews its just that there were so many wonderful reviews that I thought how could this cake go wrong.  well it did.  I got a mushy cake in the inside and the top got very dark because I kept putting it back in the oven to see if it would finish cooking.  the taste was not that great either.  it came out very greasy so i think that 1 cup of oil is way too much. I was disappointed.  I had planned on surprising my mom for mothers day but I wont be taking this now.

Loved this recipe, though I did make a few changes
-used half oil and half applesauce (extra flavour, less fat)
-cut the sugar in half and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar (it was plenty sweet from the apples and would still be quite good with even less sugar)

Baked it in a bundt pan and iced it with a cream cheese frosting (1 package cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, 4 cups icing sugar and 1 tsp vanilla) - very good!

Just made this and everyone is devouring it!
***FOLLOW THIS RECIPE TO THE T**** Seriously people, stop making changes and reviewing recipes.  It doesn't help!  Make this recipe exactly as is and you will enjoy a delicious cake with a crispy top and soft center that isn't wet.  Perrrfect. My sister makes an apple cake all the time but unfortunately for her, this beats it and has less calories (hers is made with butter).  DO NOT PUT A TOPPING/FROSTING/WHATEVER on this cake.  It is perfect as is.  Truly a 5 star.  And those who changed it will never know...

Who eats 1/24th of a cake?  I used egg substitute, sugar free applesauce (for the oil), and Splenda.  The texture comes out differently, but actually, the apple is highlighted. Very sweet and delicious.

This was amazing! I substituted 2/3 C. applesauce and 1/3 C. oil in the wet mix and only used 1 1/2 C. sugar in the dry. I let the batter sit for a good half hour or so while I chopped and added the apples, to allow the baking soda time to do its thing. After spreading into the pan, I topped it with sliced almonds and a crumb mixture that was 2 T. flour, 2 T. sugar and 1 T. cold butter cut with a pastry knife until crumbly. Baked at 325 for a little more than an hour and this turned out wonderful!!  Will definitely be making again.

LOVE this very much. My family and friends enjoyed it. I had to stop eating it myself.
I took ones advice and lowered the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I also used granny smith apples. Moist cake very perfect even four days later.
will be making it again and again!

Great recipe! I followed the suggested modifications made by others and baked them in a muffin tin for 25-30 mins, and they came out as moist, dense and delicious individual servings.

I cut back on the sugar (used 1/4 of the original amount).  I have an apple orchard in the backyard and the apples are naturally sweeter than store bought apples.
The cake was delicious,, and even better the next day after refrigeration.

Good cake BUT I was expecting more of cake texture. This was. very, very moist with a crunchy almost cookie-like top and the insides were very moist and wet and not the texture of cake at all.  It WAS very good, but just not what I expected at all.

This was just ok....I did have a problem with my hand mixer going on the fritz so I had to cream partially by hand.  The problem was that the cake got soggy so quickly and became unappealing.  Won't make this one again.

Fantastic!  I've made this twice now.  I used extra apples both times.  The second time I made it, I substituted 1/2 the oil for applesauce and used 1 cup of sugar instead of 2.  Still got rave reviews!
I also followed the advice of another reviewer and sprinkled the pan with cinnamon sugar before adding the batter.

This was a very excellent cake.  I decreased the amount of sugar to about 1 1/2 cups because that is all I had and it was plenty sweet.  I did all the mixing by hand because I don't own a mixer and it turned out a little less dense than it would have if I had used a mixer.  Still a great cake and a great recipe for using up our apples.

This is a great cake. I found it a bit too sweet after dusting with confectioner's sugar, but a glass of milk makes that perfect :) Thanks for the recipe!

I stupidly forgot to add sugar. :(( :(( 
My partner and his friends decided to put on a scoop of vanilla ice cream and tonnes of whipped cream on it. It was amazing!! The sourness of the apples well complement the sweetness in the ice cream and the cream...... (am speechless). Btw, I skipped out the cinnamon and used spekulaaskruiden (pumpkin pie spice) instead.

I had to make some changes due to diet issues and I don't use unbleached flours. It was really good. Kids loved it. I did change the apples and thinly sliced them instead of chopping. Gave it more apple flavor. A keeper.

Delicious.  I didn't really measure the apples but I used  4 smallish older apples I had (grated), and threw in 1/2 a large banana (mashed) for good measure.  I used 1/2 the oil, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves.  One batch made a regular-sized loaf and another smaller loaf.  I added an icing glaze. 
I'm currently munching on a piece from the smaller loaf, and the regular sized one will be a thank-you for friends driving us to the airport this week.  Thank you for this!

This cake is amazing. I definitely recommend the sauce that naples34102 suggested.  1/2 cup butter, 1/2 c. brown sugar, and 1/4 c. cream. Bring to a boil, then boil 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Let cool just slightly before pouring over warm cake. AMAZING.

Woah mama! This was delish! I came across this recipe, while searching for something to make with some apples I had left over from apple picking.  Instead of the 1 cup of oil, I used 1/2c oil, 1/2c applesauce.  I also added an extra 2 tsp. of cinnamon, 1 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. ground clove, and 1/4 tsp. ground ginger ( I lovvvve the fall spices!).  I made a caramel glaze that another reviewer had suggested using cream, brown sugar, butter and vanilla :~)

This cake was really good on the day it was baked. The top was nice and crunchy and the inside was moist. But after sitting for a day the cake got really, really mushy, which wasn't too appealing. And the longer it sits, the mushier it gets. I made it almost exactly according to the recipe. The only alteration I made was cutting the vegetable oil down to half a cup and adding half a cup of applesauce. I did not put any sort of icing or glaze on this cake. The only way I will make this again is if I have enough guests over to ensure it will all be eaten on the day it's baked.

I made this cake for the first time the other day.  Working together in the kitchen, my 11 year old nephew and I each made a cake.  He peeled the apples and I cored and diced them, forming a fun assembly line and cutting the preparation time in half. I made one cake for my household and he made his to bring home to his mom, dad and siblings.  This German Apple Cake was a BIG hit!  The cake was so moist and flavorful. The cinnamon and apples worked so well together, gave the flavors of an apple pie. Will definatley make this again, soon.

I LOVE THIS!! Sooo YUMMY!  I tweeked a couple things based off of the other reviews I read... Used 1/2c oil, 1/2 c apple sauce, instead of flouring the spring pan, I put cinnamon and sugar on and let it stick to the pam I sprayed it with to grease it. Then I dumped the excess out. Baked it for about 50 mins. in the spring form pan.  I highly recommend this, I shared with my neighbors and they loved it too!! Thanks for sharing!

Easy and good! I did make a few changes: Used 1/2 cup veg. oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.   Used 1 1/2 cups sugar, added  3/4 cup chopped walnuts. Sprinkled the top with powdered sugar. Before it cooled about 1/2 was consumed! Everyone loved it.

This recipe needs some serious tweaking. I found the cake tasteless. I would use 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar, Add more cinnamon and perhaps even add some walnuts or pecans. I do suggest using a very good apple. It will certainly help with the flavor.

I made this cake twice ..  and both times the inside was not cooked at all! And i kept it in for more than an hour! The outside crust was really good though. So i'm sure if it were baked all the way through it would taste delicious.

Fantastic, moist & easy! This is definitely going in my recipe book. I grated my apples & I only used 1 cup of sugar and even that was a bit too sweet. Really surprised if you all use the full 2 cups! Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was a disappointment for us.  I made the recipe as written, but we thought the cake was too dense and sugary.  The apples, sugar and oil kind of overwhelmed the other ingredients in the recipe and made for a heavy cake.  I'll choose a different recipe the next time.

This cake was a huge disappointment.  I made it twice, thinking I made a mistake the first time.  The taste is OK but the texture is all wrong.  I was expecting a cakey texture but it came out mushy even though it tested done. .  I threw out the recipe.

This is definitely a keeper! It has been devoured every time I have made it - so perfect for dessert or even as a coffee cake. The only addition/change I made was to sprinkle brown sugar over the top of the batter before baking (I did this the second time I made it and liked it better than plain). The brown sugar is so easy & there's no need for icing or frosting. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Delicious flavor and texture.  You need to eat this within a couple of days or it starts to get gooey.  I guess that could be a good thing.... but not for cake.

Oh my gosh, this was good!  I got more compliments on this cake than I have ever gotten on any other cake I've made.  It is SO moist! I made it exactly as specified in the recipe this time.  Next time, I will most definitely add either pecans or walnuts.  But even without nuts, this cake is amazing.

I followed the directions exactly except I used one large apple. It seemed to be enough when I was stirring it in. This was super thick and after about 30 minutes the middle was hard and the edges were doughy so I took it out of the oven. My son and husband liked it but I didn't care for it. It was not like a cake at all. It was like an apple cookie. Would only make again for them. 
Sorry!

Awesome! I used half a cup of oil and half a cup of applesauce and baked the cake in a bundt pan. It came out beautiful and very tasty. It takes over an hour to bake in the bundt pan (I kinda lost track of time after 60 minutes)but it looked great!

I was very frustrated with the end result! This was not cake like at all! I don't know if I did something wrong or not.  I followed the directions carefully and ended up with a very dense and sugary dough with a crunchy top. I did not leave it any longer in the oven than the recipe calls for because it would have burned. I used stone ware to bake this recipe and maybe that had something to do with it.

This was absolutely wonderful, although I made a ton of adjustments to make it low calorie. 1/4 cup oil, 3/4 cup applesauce. 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar. I also had a pear that was going to go bad so I used that in the apples too. I realized after mixing the first few ingredients together that I was out of flour - so I used 2 cups whole wheat flour. I used 3t cinnamon, and 1t pumpkin pie spice for a bit more spice. The adjustments were purely for calories' sake - not because anything tasted bad. This was SO good by itself! But then I thought about a glaze for it and couldn't help myself. Now THAT wasn't so healthy... 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2T milk melted together in a saucepan. OMG yum!!! Drizzle a little on top and it's fabulous. I'm glad that I cut the sugar in half in the cake though for sure!

Love it! I made the same changes as others have mentioned: 1/2 white, 1/2 wheat flour, 1/2 C oil, 1/2 C unsweetened apple sauce, 1/2 C Splenda/sugar mix, 3 t cinnamon and I added 1 t cloves. I chopped up 3 red apples and baked the mix in a bundt pan for 53 min. 
Such a great cake and pretty healthy with all of those changes. I already put a large section in the freezer because this cake could be eaten in a day...that's how tasty and light it is.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out wonderful!!! It was gone in a day (no leftovers).  I also added a glaze to the top of it, but it still would have been great without it.

Okay...what did I do wrong??  I kept reading about how forgiving this recipe was but I still managed to goof it up.  I DID make the changes that a lot of people made and raved about - 1/4c oil, 3/4c applesauce, 1/2 white whole wheat and 1/2 white flour,and decreased sugar to 1c, plus 1/4c brown sugar.  I also added an extra 1/2c apples and an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, which should not have affected the recipe that much.  The batter was not extremely thick (it was doable) and the top was not "cookie crunchy" like I was reading about.  The one thing that did happen right was that it turned soggy within 15 hours ~ like other reviewers mentioned.  Oh...I also sprayed with Pam and used sugar instead of flour to keep cake from sticking.  Help...what did I do wrong to such a "forgiving" recipe???

I have never before reviewed a recipe, but I had to this time!  This was wonderful... for years I have been looking for a apple cake recipe that was served at our church breakfasts years ago.  This was it exactly!  It was way worth cutting all those apples and it was even better the next morning with a cup of coffee.  My husband even tried to "forget" to take the extra pan to work and wanted to keep it for home.  My four year old twins want this for their birthday cake!  Yummmy.

Yummy and the smell that it produced while baking was delicious! I did cut down on the fat a little to make it a bit healthier by using 1/2 cup oil and 1/4 applesauce. It was still very moist and not at all rubbery-sometimes adding too much applesauce makes it taste spongy. I also thought that the flavor got better over time. I did not add a topping/frosting as  I didn't think that it needed it. It was delicious as is. Enjoy, I know you'll love it. Thanks Barbara for a great recipe.

We are really enjoying this cake.  I used about a half cup of demerera and a quarter cup of white sugars.  My other change was using a small applesauce cup into a 1 cup measuring cup and filled it with canola oil.  Next time I will add a lot more cinnamon and maybe walnuts if I have some.  I topped with powdered sugar.  Just perfect.  Obviously it is a very forgiving recipe and you can add or subtract anything to suit your taste, budget or what's in the pantry.  Thanks for posting.

A delicious cake, it was gone in 15 minutes!  I am giving it four stars because of the helpful alterations as recommended by the other reviewers.  I used 1/4 oil and  3/4 applesauce.  Also we cut the sugar down to 1 cup.  I will be making this cake again!

Fabulous!!!  I made this as the recipe called for.  It turned out so moist and wonderful!  I short cut on chopping the apples though.  I put them in my food processor and roughly chopped them, which saved a little on the prep time.  This recipe is certainly a keeper!

Excellent!  I made the following modifications:  used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil, 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 5 cups of diced granny smith apples, added 1 tsp. ginger and 1/2 tsp. each of nutmeg, allspice, and cloves.  My house smelled wonderful while baking and the taste was even better!  The apples softened up wonderfully.  When ready to serve I heated some pieces in the microwave and added a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with a sprinkle of cinnamon.

Just what I was craving. I used half the oil and about a cup of sugar. I also added a bit more cinnamon and some ground cloves. I cooked it in a bundt pan, it looked beautiful and tasted even better. Yummy.

My husband and father-in-law loved this recipe.  I followed it to a T, but it was ok for me.  I think I may have left it in the oven a bit too long and the apples lost their consistency and the overall taste of the cake was a little to applesaucey.  But given that my family liked it, I will probably make it again and pull it out of the oven a little sooner.

my DH made this for me and I must say that one bite of this cake and I'm in heaven. Cake is so moist and I just loved the powdered sugar topping. By far the best apple cake I've ever tasted. We did make some substitution though, for the shortening we used half olive oil and half applesauce and we used splenda for the sugar. Still tasted wonderful! Thanks for this receipe. Will be making this again, this time for my DH! :)

This is wonderful! I agree that you need a little less sugar and oil, but I also added more apples (5 cups) and more cinnamon(2.5-3tsp.) Your house will smell great, and the taste is even better. The cinnamon bakes to the top layer, and it is delicious. Enjoy!

I was looking for a "German" recipe to make for my daughters 21st Birthday "Oktoberfest" and this one was a huge hit!  This went faster than the decorated bakery cake and I've given the recipe out several times already.  After reading many previous reviews I cut the oil to 1/2 cup and the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and didn't notice any lack of flavor.  I used Granny Smith apples I sliced thinly, and the only topping I used was a sprinkling of sugar & cinnamon.  The house smelled fantastic!  Guests enjoyed it plain, with ice cream & with whipped topping.  It reminded me of a wonderful bread pudding, and I may add raisins next time.  What a winner - and sooo easy!

I just made this for my work and it was gobbled up in no time.   I also followed the suggestions of l/2cp oil and l-l/2 cups of sugar.  I added a tsp of cinnamon and 1/3 cup of soaked raisins (just cover the raisins with water and zap one minute in microwave).  Just add the raisins water and all.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar you'll have a fantastic moist apple cake for all.

The first time I made this cake I thought it was actually a little too sweet and need more spice. The next time I made it I cut the sugar in half and added about 1/4 tsp of ground cloves....much better! Also, I turned this into "apple cake pies" by baking it in two pie plates. They were a big hit and we even sold some in the restaurant I work in.

This is an awesome recipe that is easy and comes out perfectly.  We followed the recipe as written and have nothing but praise for it.  Excellent texture, great taste.  We make it for our students here in China and they can't get enough of it.  We like it because it can be made with ingredients always on hand and is forgiving enough to be made even in a small electric oven.

I made this exactly as written and it came out perfect! I sprinkled it with confectioners glaze instead of just powdered sugar. This is an awesome dessert, very rich, very moist. I bet it would make some super muffins.

This recipe is great!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar, and canola oil for the vegetable oil, and it is fabulous!  The light sprinkling of powdered sugar was just enough to top it off!  My husband is crazy about it!  Thanks!

i've had this recipe for a long time, when ever i have made it everyone loves it. i think part of the problem everybody is having is it is suppose to be cooked in a jelly roll pan, which is larger. it makes the cake thinner to where it cooks all the way through better. also the recipe has 1/2C. nuts.
                 frosting
3 oz. cream cheese
1/4C. butter
1t. vanilla
3C. powdered sugar
 mix well. after cooled frost bars.

Yum-Yum-Yum. This was my first apple cake and from now on will be a regular for me. I got rave reviews. I made this into a roll cake (which I don't recommend because I had a devil of a time trying to salvage- this obviously moist and luscious cake is not meant to be rolled,) and I included a cream cheese/pecan filling. I used Jonagold apples- my personal favorite- and grated them instead of chopping. This is an excellent cake recipe.

Very moist, very fluffy.  I grated the apples to get more juice out of them and the batter was not too thick that way.  I also increased the cinnamon to 3 tsp.  A hit!

This recipe calls for far too much sugar for my liking. It was also a bit too oily.  It did however have an overall good flavor.  Everyone I served it to agreed that it was good, just too sweet. So, I think I will just change the recipe to 1 cup of sugar and see how it turns out.  The apples add a little sweetness as well, so 1 cup, maybe 1&1/4 cup should be ample sugar.  I would still recommend people to try this cake.  Everyone has a different opinion.  Enjoy:-)

I found this to be a very easy recipe to prepare. It looks quite odd before it bakes but is very delicious. The only problem: eat it the day you make it or it isn't as good and becomes very heavy.

Best Apple cake I’ve ever tasted! Dense but really moist when you dice apples in larger cubes. I’ve made it twice - once in a 9x13 pan and once in a cupcake tin. Worked really well each way - just cut the baking time down a bit on the cupcakes.

Apple-Cinnamon Buttercream Icing for the cupcakes:

• 2 sticks butter, softened
• 2 lbs confectioners sugar
• 2 tsp vanilla
• 4+ Tbsp apple cider/juice
• 2 tsp salt
• 3 tsp cinnamon

Drizzle with caramel syrup. Delish!

Mine took over an hour to cook thoroughly. It came out moist with a touch of spice and was not too sweet. Used fresh tart apples from my neighbor's tree.
Oh had to change this to 5 stars because my husband said it tastes like happiness and washed the pan and cut up more apples for another cake right away.

It's very good but I'm baffled as to why anyone would call it a cake when it's more like a rich, gooey pudding. I used all the same ingredients (except the nuts) and the exact same steps. Same size of pan and temperature, but it took 60 minutes for a toothpick to come out clean, not 45. Oh well, every stove has its quirks. I can't imagine using frosting of any kind. It's already very sweet. Vanilla ice cream or just whipping cream would be fabulous, and my husband suggested a caramel sauce.

This was outstanding! Moist, tender, apple-y and very easy to make.  I've tried several apple cake recipes, and this blows them all out of the water. Take Naples34102's advice and add the caramel glaze-it takes it over the top.  I always trust her reviews for good advice!  Like some others, I subbed about half the oil with applesauce, no other changes.

Absolutely fabulous!   Moist, tasty..... what more can you ask for?!     Added about an extra cup of apples, and a bit more cinnamon- other than that followed recipe exactly.    Topped the cooled cake with 
“ That’s the best frosting I’ve ever had” from the Pioneer Woman, with some cinnamon added.     Yummy!

This was a delicious cake.  I served it at 2 potlucks, and it got rave reviews.  I have no idea what kind of apples I used...they're from a local tree with no labels!  I didn't have the same problem some reviewers mentioned, of getting soggy after a day or so, and I'm thinking the type of apple might make a difference.  I did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and topped it with the caramel glaze, and used cinnamon sugar in the bottom of the pan.  I plan to make it again tomorrow!

I did notice that this recipe calls for double the amount of apples than the one I used to make and no vanilla, but I followed the recipe as written and it is still so awesome, the flavor is about the same.  I baked my cake in a 12 Cup Bundt pan instead of the 9x13, and so I had to butter and dust with flour and let cool completely in the pan before inverting onto serving dish (otherwise it sticks). Again, THANK YOU!!  THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!!.

Super yummy! 

My alterations included 3/4 cup oil and 1/4 water, 1.5 cups sugar instead of 2, doubled the cinnamon, used whole wheat pastry flour. Oh also didn't peel the apples!
So good!

New alteration I tried because my kid wasn't into the big chunks. I cooked pears and made blended pear sauce (like apple sauce) and used 4 cups of that, with my above alterations (but minus the water). Very yummy.

This came out great! Due to circumstances beyond my control I substituted some pure maple syrup (1 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c maple syrup). Glad that happened! The cake came out really moist and sweet. I had a little over the 4 cups of apples so I added a little extra of those too. Topped it off with fresh whipped cream, a little honey drizzle and a dust of cinnamon.

The cinnamon in the batter was SO GOOD! And if you put in too many apples don't worry! It still tastes good! ;)

Followed recipe with 2 exceptions.   I didn't peel my apples, but I did put them in food processor and chop them finely and I added a teaspoon of lemon juice because my apples were very sweet. I topped with caramel topping from naples34102.  Kids LOVED it (ages 12, 14, 16 & 16) and so did husband.   Baked fully in allotted time, but it is a moist cake.  Delicious

delicious. I made it exactly as described with two exceptions. I just used cooking spray for the pan and I used about six small apples which was a little more than 4 cups. I needed to cook it about 50 minutes. it was perfect. very moist and a nice crunchy top.

This was moist and delicious! Everyone was raving about it. I will definitely make it again. I was able to use up all my past-their- prime apples and no one is the wiser.
The only changes I made was to cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, used 1/4 c butter and 1/2 c oil,  used 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda , 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp apple pie spice.

I've made this recipe 3 times in the last 2 weeks and getting ready to make the 4th one today.  This is probably the best "scratch" cake ever!  It is so easy, moist and dense and gets better a couple days after baking - if you can wait that long!  I added a handful of raisins only because my hubby is a raisin freak.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I think my version was a little bit of a departure from this recipe because I tried to make it a little healthier, but it came out incredible. Two cups of sugar seemed like a lot, so I substituted 1/4 c raw honey, 1/2 c coconut sugar, and 1/2 c white sugar. Next time, I might even cut out the 1/2 c of white sugar because I don't think it was necessary...this is an apple cake! It shouldn't really need much sugar at all. Plus, I drizzled a milk glaze over the top, which added some sweetness. I used some kind of yellow-ish apples, and I substituted Bob's Red Mill multi-grain flour for half the flour (1 c). I substituted a blend of coconut oil, olive oil, grapeseed oil, and canola oil for vegetable oil. The cake came out moist and flavorful!

This is a great recipe !! I took naples34102's advice to add 1 tsp of vanilla, and belewbubble's advices to reduce the amount of oil and sugar (I substitute white sugar to brown as well, just my personal preference) and increase the amount of apple slice to 5 cups and cinnamon to 3 tsp. Turn out great, everyone loves it, but I personally feel the flavor of cinnamon is a little too much. Probably will keep the same amount of cinnamon as recipe indicated. Anyway, I'll definitely keep this recipe!!!

Worked brilliantly. Also is pretty huge so great for when you have guests over. I have a 7 mth old baby, so can't faff around with complicated recipes and don't have time for things that don't work! I read some reviews and tweaked by only using 1/2 cup of oil and adding 1/2 cup of applesauce in lieu of all the sugar.  So, so pleased with the results!!

Made this so many times.  We adore it. I will say it doesn't need all that sugar though if you are looking to trim it down I have made it with 1/2 c oil and 1/4 c nonfat Greek yogurt replacing the whole cup of oil. In addition I use 1/4 c brown and a scant 1/2 c white sugar and 1 c each white and whole wheat flour.  Just as good as the original recipe according to my family.  I also use the marked down apples making this really inexpensive and it feeds a crowd.

I have made this cake at least five or six times. The first few times I followed the recipe exactly and I served and ate it with no frosting or powdered sugar. It was thebombdotdom. I was hooked. I have since tried one of the variations I read in the reviews, reducing the oil and increasing the apples. I also tried the cinnamon sugar instead of flouring the pan. I preferred the original recipe. I did, however, enjoy the cinnamon sugar bottom. Recently I tried it with cream cheese frosting and love it that way too. I am so glad I found this recipe.

My family enjoyed the flavors and ate this with a spoon. There just seems to be way too many apples for the amount of batter. I used 4 granny smith apples, peeled & chopped (probably larger than the "diced" called for in the recipe.) I baked it in a bundt pan for 55-minutes, and the center was mushy - more like a apple bread pudding.

Following another reviewer's suggestions: I reduced oil to 1/2 cup,  reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups, increased cinnamon to 3 teaspoons, and thinly sliced apples instead of chopping them. My daughter said she much preferred the sliced apple texture to chopped. We took this cake to Christmas Eve party and expected to have at least half cake left for us to take home for Christmas Day. It was so delicious however that we went home with only a small wedge.  It is not a "pretty" cake so I found the dusting of powdered sugar necessary for the party presentation. What it lacks in beauty it more than makes up for in wonderful taste!!!

I had brown sugar and cinnamon apples made for a pastry recipe then realized I didn't have a pie shell. I searched for an apple recipe and found this one. I'm so glad I did! I reduced oil to 1/2 cup and used my apple mix with some of the brown sugar sauce. Didn't feel like using my mixer so I just mixed the eggs and oil vigorously by hand and did the same when I added the sugar and vanilla. Stirred in flour mixture then I gently folded in the brown sugar apple mix. Used a 9 x 9 dish and a 6 muffin tin. Baked 25 minutes. Even my husband liked it and he usually won't eat baked apple desserts. Thanks for the post and for helping me use my apples!

I made this today and as others suggested I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups and I'm so glad I did. The cake is very tasty and has a chewy texture on the outside but even with reducing the sugar it was sweet. I would definitely make it again, but I would cut back on the sugar even more. I added chopped walnuts and enjoyed them in the cake.

Delicious!  I used frozen apples from our tree last year.  I also used melted coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  My only issue was that I tried to use a (greased and floured) bundt pan and I had to bake for at least 15 additional minutes...then it wouldn't come out!  So we're eating it straight out of the pan...it's still yummy!  Crispy on top, moist in the middle.  Will make again!

Great moist afternoon cake!! I added 3/4 cup rehydrated raisins, added 3 cups thinly sliced apples and 1 cup sliced pears, used only 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, 2 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cups white sugar!  Amazing moistness and perfect taste, not too sweet, a hit for the entire family!

They weren't kidding when they said that the batter would be thick. The first time I made it I freaked out and added more flour, sugar, oil, and eventually an extra egg to compensate. Even then, it still turned out really good. Made properly though, it's divine. My family begs me to make this every time we get together now. I highly recommend adding caramel topping to the batter, and also drizzling it on top of the cake when it's done baking, then sprinkling it with cinnamon and sugar.

Family loved this cake. Based on other reviews, I did tweak it a bit by using 3/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup applesauce. Also, 2/3 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. This cut down the fat and sugar content a little, but maintained the intended flavor and texture. Served with salty caramel ice cream and no frosting/topping was needed. Yum!

Not the best apple spice cake out on this site. Reduced the sugar down to about 1 1/3 cups as suggested by other reviewers. Not too happy with this as is tasted more bread like. I did increase the cinnamon but kept oil quantities the same. It was very paste like, not sure why.

The cake turned out delicious and moist.  The only downfall I had personally is that my kids & I aren't able to eat an entire cake fast enough so I cut and froze 1/2 of it and kept the rest for us to eat right way.  After the second day it wasn't very good and the piece that I froze, after taking out of the freezer for 1/2 hour was very good - but just for that one sitting.

Big hit with friends and husband. Substituted whole wheat flour and used baking stevia for half of the sugar. Noone knew the difference and still super yummy. No topping needed.

1/2 oil, 1/2 unsweetened applesauce. Decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cups, could probably go down to 1 1/4 cups next time. Incredibly delicious! Used Fuji apples.

My son and husband loved this even though I thought it should have cooked a little longer. (I will add another 5 minutes next time).  I was really surprised and a little worried about how thick the batter was but it loosened up once I started stirring in the apples.  Based on other reviews I added an extra cup of apples but followed all of the other instructions.  I also drizzled with the caramel sauce suggested by another reviewer.....yummy!

Wow this is way out of my expectation! I replaced the all purpose flour with cake and bread flour (75% / 25%) and used one apple and half a banana (didn't have enough apples), baked at 375 degrees for the first 15min and 350 for the rest. Turns out the skin is crunchy and inside has the remote texture of a lava cake! Love it! Next time I'll bake 5min less as the skin is little bit too hard when it's completely cooled.

After reading some reviews I tried the cake 2 ways.  One as it is written here, not changing a thing.  It was delicious!  I brought it to work and my co-workers devoured it!  I also made it again but this time I added a caramel glaze, calling it Caramel Apple Cake.  Again, delicious with a capital D!  I drizzled the glaze over the cake while still warm so some of it could sink into the cake and then again after the cake was cool.  I served it in a deep dish pie dish to catch any left over glaze and as people cut into the cake they scooped up the glaze to put on their individual pieces.  Just yummy!

I have been making this recipe for my family for several years now, and it is always a huge hit in the fall and winter. I have made the cake as-is before, and it is wonderful that way, but over the years we have of course adapted it to our tastes: I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, I use half whole wheat flour, and I add about 1/4 tsp cardamon along with the cinnamon. This is supposed to be a mildly spiced cake, so don't go overboard with the spices! The recommended 2 tsp of cinnamon is enough to enhance without overwhelming the apples, and the addition of 1/4 tsp of cardamon, I believe, does the same. The cake does not need a frosting. It is almost like a good coffee cake or muffin on its own, but a simple glaze, a dollop of vanilla whipped cream, or a light frosting with a cream cheese or sour cream frosting is also nice. You don't want to weigh down this cake with a thick layer of a heavy frosting. Definitely a winner for our family!

I read some reviews and made the following modifications: I used 2/3 cup canola oil, 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and 5 apples. It turned out delicious and didn't last very long here! On a 9 X 13 pan the cake baked in 35 minutes!

Quick, easy and popular recipe, that my husband has asked me to make many times for him and his guests (family/friends). I think I made it 4 times in the first month! His brother has also asked for the recipe and made it several times. It has an unusual crusty top but is perfect as long as you get the baking time right.

Seriously, make this cake.  This one is going in my recipe box at home for keeps.  With the addition of the caramel glaze by naples34102 this cake is to die for.  Doubled the spices (we like really spices breads) and that was the only change I made.  It was made for a party and every single person who tried it was raving about how delicious it was!!

After tasting this cake, I have to say, it is one of "the" best cakes I have ever had...it's "that" good! The only changes I made were adding 1/4 cup of applesauce and 3/4 cup oil and adding an additional teaspoon of cinnamon. I baked in a bundt pan for about 55-60 minutes, and  also used the sauce recommended by naples34102, and she's correct, it sends an already fantastic cake "over the top." Thanks for sharing this WONDERFUL recipe. This recipe has both the wow and the YUM factors. :)

As another reader wrote, I was so excited to try this based on other reviews, but to be honest, not only was it VERY bland, but had a very hard crusty inedible top and mush, far too dense inside. Even if it had cooked properly, I wouldn't enjoy this at all. I made this for a cookout with myself and one very sweet teen girl who also took one bite and put her fork down, afraid to say anything. I made this exactly as the recipe stated. Perhaps with the adjustments others mentioned, it might be better, but I won't try it again, even with adjustments. Im sorry.

I really enjoyed this cake served warm and topped with whipped cream. I did however add a little Nutmeg to the recipe to add a little more flavor.
The batter is extremely thick and it was difficult to fold in the apples, but with time, I got them folded in.
Next time I make this, I think I am going to coat the apples with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar before folding them in to the batter.

It's important to note that this calls for far too much sugar, especially if you're planning to use a caramel sauce as some reviewers have suggested. I didn't want to use even a cup and a half of sugar, but I like to stay as close to the original recipe as possible the first time I make anything. I used a cup and a half and it was still too sweet. Next time I'll only use a cup or 3/4 cup of sugar. (And I say this as a girl who likes sugar.) Having run out of brown sugar and cream, I popped open a can of La Lechera Caramel, scooped some in a bowl, nuked it in the microwave and spread a thin layer over this cake. Mind blown! The cake itself is very yummy. But the caramel addition, with a touch of vanilla ice cream makes it incredible! Just be sure to half the sugar! This is a dessert that will def be on the table next holiday season. It's really good! I may try it with apple sauce and reduce the oil the next time I make it. Many thanks to Barbara for sharing this recipe!

This apple cake was a HUGE hit at our house!  It was moist and delicious.  I used 1 Cup applesauce instead of oil, and 1 Cup of Truvia Baking Blend instead of the 2 cups of sugar. I used jonagold apples fresh from the orchard.  It was healthy and delicious!  I will be making this again very soon!

The best apple cake.  I made it in a 9 x 13 inch pan and although it seemed overwhelmed with apples (more apples than batter), the result was a crispy outside from the caramelized sugars of the apples and a soft interior.  No need for a caramel topping as others suggested, but a dollop of cream is divine!  Best served warm.

Holy Cow!!  So moist, so delicious!!  I added 1/4 tsp of ground cloves and a pinch of ground ginger to my mix and also used 6 apples (various sizes).  As soon as the cake came out of the oven I sprinkled sugar over the top.  This is a fabulous Apple Cake recipe.  I'm going to make it for Thanksgiving.  LOVE!

This is delicious. I made it in a Bundt pan and it came out crispy and crackly on the outside. I followed the recipe almost exactly, only substituted a little oat flour for some of the all-purpose. I think next time I'll use less sugar; it doesn't need to be as sweet. I'm going to make another one for Thanksgiving.

Made this cake for hubby and we both loved it! It's definitely a keeper - with a few minor modifications.

I always try to make a recipe the first time exactly according to instructions. This one, though...  the thought of a full cup of oil made me squishy inside, so I used somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 cup and made up the rest with unsweetened applesauce. I also cut down on the sugar from 2 cups to 1.5 cups (whoa boy, can you say diabetes???). The cake was still pretty sweet, but not overboard, and very very moist. 

We ate it un-iced, un-adorned with anything but a dollop of whipped cream. I wouldn't recommend frosting or glazing. It's just too much, too sweet, and completely unnecessary.

To the people who complain that it's too soggy? It may be your apple choice. MacIntosh and Cortland tend to cook down and get very mushy when baked. Try using a firmer, slightly more tart variety like Granny Smith. The slices or chunks actually keep their shape instead of cooking down into the batter.

Thanks for a great recipe, I'll definitely be making this again!

I've made this recipe twice and love it! I used granny smith apples both times and it tastes very good. Instead of using oil, I used 3/4 cup to 1 cup of applesauce. Also, I did a few drops of almond extract to add some flavor. I cooked it in a bundt pan instead to make it more pretty. Finally, I made a glaze with some powdered sugar, milk, and almond extract to tie everything together. This one is a keeper!

Can't say ENOUGH about this recipe! It's SO GOOD! I've made it three times now, the first time I didn't change a thing! And it was YUMMY! The second and third time I made some changes. I used butter spread instead of oil, which I think is what made the difference between the oil one not getting cooked in 45 minutes and my second and third being JUST RIGHT at that mark! I added way more cinnamon and some pumpkin pie spice! We love that stuff! I added extra apples, a lot, I didn't measure. It was VERY apple heavy! I made the carmel sauce in Naples comment but added powdered sugar to it after it was cooled, until it was a frosting consistency and smeared it all over the cake while it was still hot. It is amazing and I'm going to make this ALL THE TIME! One of our new favorites! It would also be amazing with a apple crisp style topping too!

Five stars with my edits, which I got from other reviewers: Replaced cup of oil with 1/3 c. oil, 2/3 c. unsweetened apple sauce; only used 1 1/4 c. sugar; used 3 t. cinnamon and 5 c. apples. Very yummy cake - more like a breakfast cake than a dessert. I wish I had noticed another reviewers comments that it doesn't keep very well. After 24 hrs it starts to get quite soggy, though when it first comes out of the oven it's amazing!

I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of apple butter since I was low on oil. also I cut the sugar down to 1 cup. It was very good the first day, got a little gooey the second day but it disappeared pretty quickly. good snack cake. I will try it with wheat flour next time to make a healthier snack for my kids. I drizzled it with some leftover maple glaze I had and it was very good but sweet and tasty enough on its own. Would be awesome with nuts in it. would recommend cutting apples very small or thinly sliced.

This cake is delicious and it's a great way to use up my extra apples! I used the caramel glaze as recommended by naples34102. I took one bite and went straight to heaven. My (picky) son loved it too. This recipe is a keeper, thanks so much for sharing!

Made it as directed and did pour over a caramel topping. Hubby loved it and said it would be great with coffee. I tried a piece and thought it could use more spice. I'll add come apple pie spice next time.

Loved this recipe . Made it exactly as follows but added 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla . Was super moist and had enough apples for my liking . Only adjustment I would make next time is cut sugar in half (1 cup ) and oil ( substitute applesauce 1/2 oil , 1/2 applesauce ) I found it a little too sweet for my taste. I used sweet apples as well (golden delicious ) so really could have cut sugar in half.

This is soooooo good and so easy! The only thing I did differently was use 1cup of white sugar and 1cup of brown sugar. Apples, cinnamon and brown sugar just made sense to me :)

I ALWAYS have a problem getting any cake I make to bake all the way through. So I was a little worried when I read all the reviews of people complaining about that happening with this cake. Ironically, this is the ONE cake recipe I've followed where the cake baked *perfectly*. I did have to bake it for longer, I'm not sure how long it ended up being exactly... an hour and 15 minutes, I think. But after that it came out just right. 

I followed the recipe closely but used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup vanilla soy milk (since it seemed like a LOT of oil and I didn't have vanilla extract). Since the soy milk was sweetened I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2. The cake is absolutely delicious and not soggy, dense or mushy at all. The only thing I might change next time is cutting back a little more on the sugar, is a cup of sugar per cup of flour really necessary? I was torn between giving this cake 4 or 5 stars, if it weren't for the inaccurate baking time and excess sugar and oil listed I'd say this is a 5 star recipe.

I cut this recipe in half and made it into twelve cupcakes, and they were absolutely delicious! The only problem I encountered was that they didn't quite cook all the way, even after I'd left them in the oven for over 30 minutes. I added extra apple, so I wonder if that kept them from cooking. Either way, the taste was to die for!

I baked this cake last weekend and followed the recipe. The only ingredient I altered was the vanilla extract. I still had one vanilla pod so I used it instead. I also added almond flakes in the batter. Total baking time was around 1 hour (after 45 mins, the cake was still kinda mushy inside though the top already looked brownish and well baked). It turned out really well, moist, and surprisingly delicious. However I expected the cinnamon caramel sugary crunches aroma didn't exaggerate the apple taste. I didn't make the frosting cause it's already sweet, I suggest vanilla ice cream with whipped cream is best companion for this cake. My hubby really loves the cake and he keeps digging it the day after (even the cake turned out to be more delicious after the second night). This recipe is definitely a keeper for me and I plan to bake it again this christmas with some alterations: 1 more egg, 1,5 cup sugar, more apples.

I searched for the recipie that most resembled the one my Mom used to make. This was it. Just made it and it's perfect! Moist, simply sweet (better w/out any frosting), and just right for breakfast and coffee!

Pleasant enough, however it turned out to be pretty wet in the end and took on a more pudding-like quality instead of cake-y.

The recipe called for tons of apples, so that might be the reason it was wet. Took on the other user suggestions of halving the oil to 1/2 cup and reducing the sugar to 1 1/2 cup, which I'm glad I did because I would not have wanted the cake to be even wetter and oilier than it was.

Serving this does not look as pretty as a cake would, as it gets pretty messy when cut due to its texture and all the apples getting in the way.

This cake is absolutely delicious.  The only changes I made were to substitute half of the oil with Greek plain yogurt, 1 TBSP of cinnamon and then I added 2 tsps of allspice and 1 tsp of nutmeg.  I made it in a bundt pan and then sprinkled confectioner's sugar on top.  I ate it for breakfast every morning.  I am getting ready to make another one and freezing it for Thanksgiving.

I love this apple cake, it's truly moist and delicious. I like others altered it by reducing sugar to 1 1/2 cups oil to 3/4 cup, 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites,  I added 1/2 cup applesauce to make up for oil and sugar that was taken out.

Yummy!!! Way better than i thought it would be. I topped it with the caramel topping that another user recommended, which gave it a nice crunchy top. Thanks Barbara!***IMPORTANT*** Do NOT overbake this cake, it tastes MUCH better when moist than when dry, a couple of minutes can make a big difference, if the toothpick is a bit moist but has crumbs on it, the cake is done.

Followed this recipe to the letter, except I baked as 24 apple-cinnamon muffins. Baked at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes, checked with a toothpick and they were done. Brought the batch to work and all were gone by 10:30 AM. Coworkers liked the apple moistness and sweet caramel crunch from the sugar. As I have an abundance of apples, will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I altered the recipe just a bit- used cake flour, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 2 teaspoons vanilla(cause I love it so much).  I beat the eggs for a minute and then added oil and beat for another minute until it was frothy.  I was a bit nervous because the batter was so thick, but oh my goodness, it is delicious.  I also used a bundt pan, sprayed baking pam, and then instead of flour I used another reviewers suggestion of using cinnamon sugar as the coating.  It turned out great.  I'm not even planning on frosting it! baked at 350 for 50 minutes.

This cake was excellent.  I didn't change a thing and was so happy with it.  My usual cakes are from boxes so I was so proud of this cake.  It was very easy to make.  Perfect for a party so that it does get eaten quickly since it does start to get sticky on the 2nd day.

Heavenly!!!! Absolutely awesome!! I made this cake exactly as the recipe called for, I just added about 1/2 cup more apples. I used golden delicious because they are so nice and sweet. I made this for my mother's birthday and everybody LOVED it! I dressed it up with cream cheese icing and marshmallow fondant just to make it look pretty, but it's awesome on it's own. This is the best cake I've had. Really delicious!!!

Great recipe for those of us who are allergic to cows milk AND the rest of the guests that aren't. I baked this cake for my 1 year old's birthday. She can't eat any form of dairy products, so I was looking for a cake recipe that she could have. I expected to find something which would be medium in yummieness, but instead, everybody was raving over this cake! I used the exact recipe,so with the whole cup of oil. I was a little scared of how thick the batter (or more of a dough, actually) became. But after the apple pieces were folded in, it was just fine. I used a simple frosting to cover the cake and write a text on it in pink (only icing sugar, a little bit of lemon juice to balance it out, and some water to create the right thickness).

Absolutely wonderful recipe!!!  Everyone who tried it loved it.  I agree you can cut down on the sugar :) Definitely will make again. Great for using/getting rid of over-ripe apples!

Very good. Gets soggy by the next day so I would recommend refridgerating it because then it's like apple bread pudding.

I saw this picture and knew immediately it was the cake my paternal grandmother used to bake. I had always wanted to bake it but did not know what it was called. I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was absolutely heavenly. My son who is on a strict, self-imposed diet could not resist it from the first bite. In my opinion it does not need any kind of frosting, glazing, dusting or anything else to enhance it. I will however, next time, try reducing oil and sugar with the applesauce and brown sugar recommendations but, I always like to try as written for review purposes. Way too much said....lol, cake is awesome, thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Turned out fluffy and delicious. I followed other reviewers and reduced the oil (though I used melted butter) by half, and used 1.5 cups of sugar. Still a little sweet for my taste. Used 5 cups of apples. Husband and mother in law loved it!

Kept it the same as recipe above except added 2 more tsp. vanilla. Very moist and tasty! Loved it, thanks. Just next time will reduce sugar by 1/2 c. since I prefer a little less sweet. Otherwise, really good!

I followed the recipe to the letter. The cake was amazingly moist, not too sweet and delicious. I was short of apples so I added 2 pears. We can't hardly tell the difference. Perfect accompaniment to coffee. This so easy and a keeper!

This cake was quite delicious! I used 1/2 cup of oil (as suggested by others) instead of the full cup & 5 apples. I also increased cinnamon to 3.5 tsp (you can never have too much cinnamon if you ask me!).

Couple of minor issues: Recipe says to grease & flour pan. I'd never "floured" a pan before so I thought it was somehow necessary for this recipe. Then I ended up with big ugly chunks of flour at the bottom of my cake. The grease was enough, no need for flour.

Also, I can't figure out why my cake was so flat. I thought maybe because the apples were so heavy but then I see the pictures of nice fat bundt cakes here....Mine kinda looked like picture 26 - low like a bar. Can anyone tell me how I can make it rise more next time?

All in all, this cake was really really excellent & I will make it again FOR SURE.

I made this cake today for the first time, with a few changes.  Instead of 1 cup of oil, I used a half cup of oil and a half cup of apple sauce.  Also, instead of 2 cups of sugar, I only used 1 1/4 cups.  Baked it for about 55 minutes in a Bundt pan, and it came out beautiful!  Sprinkled powder sugar on top once it cooled, and then sampled it.  My husband and I both liked it very much.  My husband remarked that I had used just the right amount of sugar; if I had used 2 cups it would have been much too sweet for our taste.  I'll definitely make this cake again.

Very tasty but unfortunately I had to cook it for much longer because the middle was still soggy but then the edges were a bit crunchy/burnt.  Next time I will definately do it in a bundt tin.

My husband thinks that it has more the consistency of bread pudding than cake. It might be because I used a lot of apples. I served it with caramel sauce and people liked it.

So good! I had some extra apples laying around and wanted to use them before they went bad.  Came across this recipe and boy am I glad! Tried to make it a bit healthier so I replaced 1/2 C of the oil with applesauce and only put in 1/4 C. more oil, cut the sugar to 1 3/4 C (I think 1.5 C would be perfect), added 1 extra tsp cinnamon and vanilla.  4.5 C of apples and instead of flour used cinnamon and SPAM to grease the pan.  Today's it's third day and it taste just as good as the first, not soggy at all (maybe because I reduced the oil).  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Perfect. Exceptional. I can't even fathom the need to add any kind of topping or glaze to this. I followed the recipe precisely, and it is superb as written, super sweet and melts in your mouth. It would make fantastic muffins. I want to open a bakery that features nothing but this cake. Profit!

I had a ton of apples so I decided to try something new.  This "cake" is delicious but VERY moist.  My husband actually said it was more like a bread pudding than cake and I tend to agree.  The only thing I changed was I substituted applesauce for the oil.  I also used a bundt pan thinking it would be like a cake.  If I make it again I will stick to the 9x13 dish like the recipe calls for.

This apple cake recipe is to die for!!!  My mom owned a recipe for an apple cake that I had lost accidently at a grocery store shopping for the recipes.  Since then I have tried many recipes looking for one that was as good as the one I lost.  I tried this one on Christmas and took it to my mothers, and when it came time to eat it, everyone was ooing and awwing!! Unbelievably delicous!  Didnt make any changes and added the brown sugar glaze: 1 stick of butter, 2 tsp of condensed milk and 1/2 packed brown sugar.  I found a winner apple cake recipe and is agreed by the whole family that it is better than my mom's original recipe!!!

I made this cake gluten free by using my own GF flour blend.  I also used half a cup of apple sauce and half a cup of grapeseed oil and I made the sauce posted earlier (half cup butter, half cup brown sugar, and 1/4 cup cream).  This cake came out FANTASTIC.  The caramel sauce soaked into it and it's really moist and almost like a bread pudding now and it's delish.

Less sugar (about 1 1/2 cup), which is a mixture of white and brown caster sugar. Apart from cinnamon, also some allspice (1/2 teaspoon) and cardamom (1/2 teaspoon). 1 teaspoon of baking soda AND 1 teaspoon of baking powder. About 75 minutes in the oven.

I made this for Thanksgiving desert and it came out wonderful! I used Granny Smith apples which helped balance out all the sweetness. It's now our favorite cake and I can't wait to make it again at Christmas! The ease of making it is a big plus as well!

Had no troubles at all, this came out great. Only used half the oil, and only 1 1/2 cups of sugar and it still tasted wonderful. I added a lot more apples, which made up for the oil I cut back on.  Very simple and fast, definitely a favorite.

I've been looking for a good "Applely" apple cake for years and this is the one.  I, too, used half oil and half applesauce and decreased the sugar by about a third of a cup. I mostly make bundt cakes without icing because my cakes are usually travel for lunches, so it struck me odd that the recipe only called for 2 eggs.  I added an extra egg which I think why some of the other reviewers had trouble with theirs holding up.  I will definitely be making this one again.

Brilliant! I used half Granny SMith and half Gala Apples finely diced  and I also added a pinch of nutmeg (every time I use cinnamon) but the rest I did exactly as directed. Came out outrageously moist and flavorful.

This was really yummy, though I thought it was a little too sweet, I also think the recipe needed some nuts, but that's just my opinion. Next time I make this (and I will make it again) I'll try reducing the amount of sugar and adding some chopped nuts to the mix.  I used turbino sugar for this recipe which gave it a really great flavor.

I used 3/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil in place of the whole cup of oil.  I also used 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour.  I wanted more spice so I doubled the cinnamon, added a shake of all spice, a few shakes of ground cloves, and a pinch of nutmeg.  This ROCKED!!  I topped it with caramel frosting III (more of an icing than a frosting).   VERY, VERY yummy.

Wonderful recipe! The only change I made was I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  It really doesn't need frosting either. As for some of the reviewers saying it got to moist the next day, I put it in the refrigerator and it was fine. Thanks for sharing!

This cake was so good!!!!!!!! Everyone loved it. The crust was nice and crunchy. It doesn't need any frosting or glaze. It tastes even better with a glass of cold milk or hot apple cider. I would make this every week but I'm not a huge fan of peeling and chopping apples. Be sure to make this the same day you plan on serving it. After a day or so it gets very mushy.

As per previous reviewer, used 3/4C applesauce and 1/4C oil in place of a whole cup of oil. Next time, I will reduce sugar to 1.5C. Also, I julienned the apples and they worked great. By my calculation, using all applesauce for oil and cutting out a half cup of sugar reduces the calories per serving of this cake to 105.5! Definitely doable and guilt free.

I had only 2 granny smith apples and wanted to make cupcakes out of these. It turned out pretty darn good. My husband liked it, too. I halved the recipe to make 10 cupcakes, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 oil, and finely diced the apples. So next time I will make a cake instead of cupcakes and use apple sauce as other reviewers had mentioned.

This cake was good and moist. I did make a few changes. Instead of apples, I had some peaches that were very ripe. I used 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. I only used 1 cup brown sugar.  1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. It was plenty sweet. I served it with vanilla ice cream and fresh blueberries.

Low Glycemic Version:  1/2 whole wheat flour, and substituted 1 c. Splenda BLend and 1 c. pure Spenda for the sugar.  I also added a pinch each of mace, allspice and ground cloves for flavor.  I added a small amount of buttermilk to loosen the batter and ensure better rising to counter-act the whole wheat flour.  The cake turned out moist and light, although that much Splenda will add a sugar-free taste.

Oh my goodness!! This cake is WONDERFUL!!. I halved the recipe to make a 9x9 cake. And since my mother and I are diabetic, I used Splenda Blend instead of sugar. I tossed in a handful of chopped walnuts also. Otherwise made just as recipe stated. I am not normally fond of cake with fruit, but this one was so simple to make and so good that I will be making this frequently.

This is an excellent recipe! I only just made it and it is already half gone. I did as some other reviewers recommended and used 3/4 cups of apple sauce and only 1/4 cup of vegetable oil, and I only used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of splenda. I baked it in a 9x13 pan, but it only took 30 minutes to bake. I thought it would be a thicker cake, so next time I will double the recipe and still use the 9X13 pan. I topped it while it was still warm with cool whip and it was perfect! Thanks so much for sharing, I will definitely be making this again!

Be warned, this is a moist, dense, cake. Swapped in apple sauce in place of the cooking oil, no doubt adding to the moistness, but man, did it ever imbue the cake with fabulous appleness.

Excellent moist cake full of apples that was not too sweet.  I baked mine in a bundt pan for about an hour to achieve doneness and added about a quarter teaspoon of fresh nutmeg.  Otherwise, I made no changes.  A definite make again!

I have made this recipe a number of times and it has become a favorite of anyone that tries it. I make it with apple sauce replacing the oil. I also do not frost of powder this cake when finished, it is sweet and flavorful enough without anything on top. This makes a very moist and flavorful cake. I prefer to use tart apples in this recipe.

I finally made this cake and it is truly fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was easy, moist, a little crunchy on the top and super delicious.  Every Sunday, we have a pot luck beach gathering and it was a total hit with my friends.  It was so delicious that I'm going to make it for my office for Christmas.

This is my 5 year old daughters favorite cake!  It is the only cake she will eat...she even asks me to make it for her Birthday cake.  It is so yummy!  I usually add more cinnamon because we love it, the more the better.  The original recipe is amazing but has a lot of sugar an oil.  We make it so much that I have made it a little healthier and it is still great!  I use 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 and 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

One of the best cakes I have ever had!  I made this yesterday for a family BBQ and it was so good!  I just had some more for breakfast!  I used 1 cup light brown sugar/1 cup granulated and I think it made it that much richer.  I also took the advice of another person who commented and sprayed the pan and used cinnamon, brown sugar/granulated sugar in place of the flour.  It made the outside crisp and with a crunchy-sugar coating- SO GOOD!  I drizzled a simple brown sugar/granulated sugar/cinnamon syrup over the top and let it harden- crunchy on the outside and so moist on the inside!  Will DEFINITELY make this again and again!!!!

Very good cake!!! We loved it. I did few modifications such as use half whole wheat flower and half white. I used 1 tbs of baking powder instead of baking soda, and I used 1/2 cup of oil with 1/2 cup of apple sauce. Baked in a bundt cake pan. Turned out perfect.

Really, really good cake - especially right out of the oven!  I used splenda for the sugar, half wheat flour/half white flour and grated half of the apples/chopped the other half.  This was very easy to make and has a great taste.  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome cake! I used 3/4 cup oil, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup white sugar and 5 cups apples. Baked at 350 for 60 minutes in a bundt pan that I had sprayed with Pam and dusted with white sugar (great suggestion from other reviewers!).  Dusted the top with powdered sugar and then sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar.  Totally moist, light and delicious!  I would definitely recommend decreasing the oil and increasing the apples.

I picked a bunch of apples at my in-laws farm and put them to good use with this recipe! Delicious!  The only change I made was to use 1/4 cup of applesauce and 3/4 cup vegetable oil (instead of the 1 cup of vegetable oil). Turned out wonderfully. This one is a keeper!

Very yummy.  I used 1/2 c. oil and a 1/2 c. applesauce.  I frosted this with Caramel Frosting IV on this site.  I may try decreasing the sugar next time, but it's still very good as is.

Very moist and tasty cake that goes great with company and coffee! I did make the following changes: I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup, the sugar to 1 3/4 cup, and compensated for the reduction in oil by adding extra apples: about 5 cups worth.  I've made this a couple of times now with this modification and it has turned out so moist.  I do not add a topping, but it is great when served with vanilla icecream.

This was wonderful.  I made it last night with some orchard apples that were going to go bad and it turned out just great.  Not too sweet, very tasty, and moist.  I made this in a 9"x13" pan and cooked at the exact temp and time as suggested.  I noticed this AM that the middle could have been done just a little bit more, so maybe another 10-15mins would have helped, but it was still totally edible.  The only change I made was to use olive oil instead of veg. oil (that's all I had), I halfed that and for the other half I used applesauce.  I would suggest the veg. oil if you have it on hand since olive oil has such a strong flavor and smell.  I also think I may have added a bit more than 4c. of apples, but it still turned out just fine.  This was a nice treat for both after dinner and breakfast. Enjoy! :)

Very Good!!  Followed some other posters reccomendations and used 1 cup white sugar and a 1/2 cup brown sugar and cut the oil down to 1/4 cup and used 3/4 cups applesauce.  Covered with a caramel sauce someone else posted.  Everyone loved it!  Will definitely make again.

A really enjoyable cake! I have made this a few times using apples or pears depending on what I have handy. The only changes I made was to use 1 cup white sugar and a 1/2 c brown sugar. I also used 1/2 c applesauce and 1/2 c oil.

I have made this several times now. Love it. I did take the suggestion of reducing the sugar though. Other than that it is perfect! YUM!!

Very delicious and easy to make! I've made this many times and everyone loves it. In my opinion, this recipe is best with 3-4 Grannie Smith apples for tartness. I also like cutting the apples in different sized chunks-some small, some large to add variation. For the top, all it needs is a little sprinkling of powdered sugar and cinnamon. Like other reviewers, I usually cut down on the sugar & oil and up the cinnamon as well.

I love this recipe.  I have used pears and apples in it depending on what I have the most of and what is in season.  I use applesauce in place of half the fat to make it healthier and cannot taste a difference.  It is a wonderful cake!  Thanks so much for sharing this.  It has become a family favorite.

A very nice cake. I halved the sugar in this recipe and it still seemed a little sweet, so I'll reduce it by a tad next time. Used applesauce in place of half the oil and upped the apples by 1c.
I was worried that there were more apples than batter when I put half the recipe in an 8x8 square pan, but after 35 min in the oven I had a lovely brown dimply cake that was a lighter texture than I expected (still very good) and had just the right amount of apples. We ate it for breakfast the next morning. I would make this again, perhaps as muffins.

Excellent and delicious cake.  To stick to my new year's resolutions (somewhat) I substituted apple sauce for the oil (entirely) and used 1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup self-rising flour.  I also cut down the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and used brown sugar instead.  Baked it for about 50 minutes in a bundt pan (my oven is a little on the hot side) and it turned out perfectly; moist, flavourful, and totally delicious. I served it with vanilla tea.  Amazing! Will definitely make again and again.

This is one fabulous cake!  After looking at the photos I decided to use a Bundt pan and that was a huge mistake.  The top of the cake was wonderfully crisp over a dense cake and by using a Bundt pan not only did I have trouble releasing it from the pan, I had to turn it over on to that crisp crust.  Had I made it in a 9 x 13 pan as directed I would have had more of that delectable crust and no release problems.  I made a caramel sauce for this and it was not needed; this cake is perfect as is.

Yummy! We ate this right after it came out of the oven.  Baked it in a bundt pan.  It was really moist and good.  I added extra spices just because I like extra :)

Wonderful!  This was my first attempt at making an apple cake and it came out perfect!  The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil.  Applesauce tends to make my cakes moist.  My co-workers raved about this!

I went exactly by the recipe, and this cake is fabulous! It's even better the next day, being very moist and not too sweet. Next time I bake one, I'm going to do a bit of experimenting, using only three apples and adding either walnuts or pecans.

Great recipe!  I did make some changes that I thought made it even better- Changed sugar to 1C white, 1C Brown, made it 5C Apples and 2 tsp vanilla.  Perfect with just powdered sugar!

I dont know what happened but the bottom of mine was very soft and mushy but it turned out to be a good thing. The batter is really thick and it actually broke my mixer so I dont suggest trying to use a hand mixer for this one. But in the end it was delicious. One of my roommates apparently woke up at 2 in the morning just to eat more of it. It was gone by morning.  when i made this recie the second time the inside still didnt cook so i kept it in longer thinking that would help but it just ended up becoming hard.

Hubby absolutely loved this, he always wants apple cake for his birthday cake. Even tho it isn't his birthday I thought I would try it any ways and it is the best one I've ever made. I did substitute applesauce for half the oil and used half wheat flour as well.

i give it a 4. it comes out amazing BUT another reviewer was right when they said the next day it comes out a mushy mess. well not exactly a mushy mess, but over a couple of days it get soggy, like it wasnt cooked through. maybe reduce the oil and up the cooking time. i kept checking mine, and i made it in my grandmothers ages old springform silver pan with ridges on the bottom, so you would have thought it wouldnt have taken longer to cook with the hole in the middle. anyway it was WONDERFUL FOR THE FIRST 24 HOURS!!!

This cake is absolutely amazing!!  Even hubby loved it and he's not a big fan of cinnamon.  I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8-inch springform pan.  I also added a crumb topping and I used the "Crumb Topping for Pies" recipe found on this site, but I quartered it (1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour, 1-2 tbsp butter - mix together with a fork till crumbly).  I also took it a step further and also made  caramel sauce (had to indulge).  Melt a 1/4 cup butter in a small sauce pan, add a 1/4 cup cream and 1/2 brown sugar, and simmer on low heat till thickened (about 2-3 minutes); then add 1 tsp vanilla.  The sauce makes the cake very decadent so you only need a little (you can also serve the cake in smaller pieces).  Don't forget to sprinkle icing sugar on top and you have yourself an elegant dessert!

FINALLY!!!  I baked something that didn't come out a total disaster.  This cake was easy to make and its delicious!  I think I'll cut the cooking time down to 35 min next time since the outside got a little crispy.  The the inside was moist and delicious though.  Making this again!!!  :)

This cake is very good but hard to judge when it is done.  I overcooked it a little, although it still tasted good.  I did tweak this a little as well.  I cut the oil to 1/2 cup and then added 1/2 a cup of Cinnamon Applesauce.  I also used 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  I added pecans to the mix as well because my family loves pecans in everything.  I sprayed my pan with Pam and then used a cinnamon/Splenda mixture instead of flour.  The cake was good by itself, but what made it really good was the glaze I put on top.  I used 1/2 cup stick butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 tsp. milk, boil until sugar is dissolved and pour over the cake...YUM!!!  This definitely made it a hit!  Good Recipe.

This is a very good cake but I think the recipe calls for too much oil. I only used 1/2 cup (grapeseed oil) and the cake is very moist and dense. I did add 1/2 cup of apple sauce to compensate but I really think it would have been fine without it.

This was wonderful.  I made mine in a bunt pan, and it came out perfect.  I took the suggestions of 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce, and only 1 cup of sugar.  My kids loved it.  I made it for dessert last night, and it is almost gone already.  I will definately use this again.

OMG! So tasty, so moist! Unbelievable. I'm almost afraid to look at the fat content, but I would make this for any special occasion. I didn't have cream cheese icing but I would bet that it would go soooooo well with this. I was leery about the level of sugar in this recipe, and ended up substituting in about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of brown sugar in, which I think helped make a tasty thin crust on the top.

Wonderful apple cake for fall.  It wasn't terribly sweet.  Dust with powdered sugar and serve with a great cup of coffee.  Wunderbar!

This is the most delicious apple cake recipe I have tried. I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup splenda and it is still amazing!

This cake is delicious but I had a hard time telling exactly when it was done baking.  I used the toothpick test but the middle was still underdone.  I made a double recipe.  I made one 13x9 inch pan, one 9 inch springform pan and one 8 inch regular round cake pan.  They are still cooling but I think I'm going to put some cream cheese frosting on them. (I had to taste it so I cut into the small cake while it was still warm) Good way to use up apples.  I used about 8 medium size apples for the double recipe. The only change to the recipe that I made was to add a big pinch of allspice.  I'm glad I did - it was perfectly spiced.  I think the frosting will improve the looks a bit - it's not the prettiest cake but it is extremely tasty and moist.  And it's extremely easy to put together.

Delicious!  Used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2C white flour, sprinkled the top with 1/2 cup brown sugar and a little cinnamon before baking, but kept the rest per the recipe.  Very moist,really excellent!  Next time I'll throw in a handful or two of hickory nuts and some craisins.  Thanks for this most delicious cake recipe.

I agree that it's a great moist cake, but next time I will reduce the amount of oil and increase the cinnamon. I sliced apples over the top before cooking as a topping and it looked great!

I've just made this cake for the third time and it's in the oven as I type this. 

What a great recipe! Every time I've made it, I've changed it a little bit. I slice my apples very thinly and don't bother peeling them. They break up when stirred in and the thin strips of peel add a nice texture to the finished cake. I halve the sugar and add about 1/4c of blackstrap molasses. Last time I made it, I used pears instead of apples and added some chopped candied ginger ~ yum! We'll see how it turns out this time, since I didn't have any eggs and instead used 2Tbsp flax seed + 1/4c water whizzed together with the hand blender. This might turn out to be a great vegan recipe. The batter is _very_ thick and it's quite a bit of work to stir the apples in but it gets easier as they break up and release their juices. 

This cake freezes extraordinarily well as individual pieces in ziploc bags!

Very Moist and very good taste.  Rave reviews in my house :)  I took the advice of others and reduced the amount of oil called for but I felt it still needed more than the lowered amount recommended so I went in between and used 3/4 cup oil (I used corn oil and it worked great) and I upped the cinnamon to 3 tsp and lowered the sugar to 1 1/2 cups white sugar.  This batter is thick as mentioned in the recipe. I used it in a 9x13 pan and it was perfect. It released from the pan easily (I greased & floured the pan) Great way to use up apples that you have on hand. (I used 5 average sized granny smith) Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This recipe is very good. I used half oil/half apple sauce, and reduced the sugar in half as well. It was delicious served with vanilla ice cream. Also, it freezes pretty well.

This has to be the best cake I have EVER eaten!

The only things I changed was I put three tsps. of cinnamon, 1/4 c. vegetable oil, and 3/4 c. applesauce. Sugar, a little over a cup.

This cake is SO good, moist, and flavorful!

I can't wait to make this again... It's a winnner!

Oh, and I didn't frost it... I sprinkled the powdered sugar (I suggest powdering before serving because the sugar just sinks into the cake).  Personally, I think this cake is SO good that it doesn't need anything!

Thank you so much for sharing this!   God bless you!

LOVE it!! Also cut down on the sugar, probably added more apples, less oil more applesauce and a lot more cinnemon. Also sprinkled sugar with cinnamon over the top before putting it in oven and it made the crust nice and crispy. Have been making it almost every weekend since September :)

This is a fantastic apple cake!  I used a combination of apple varieties that added a very interesting touch as it is apple season here and so much is available.  All were medium sized apples - 1 Granny Smith, 1 McIntosh and 2 Gala which made a generous 4 cups - I also added a dash of Orange Peel.  I followed the rest of the recipe exact.  I didn't get a chance to put any sugar or frosting on it - it got devoured!!!!  This recipe would also be a great base to add other fruits or nuts for the hoildays.  Great recipe - Thank You!!

This was very good!! My husband couldn't wait to try it so we cut it while it was still warm. I used 1/4 c. oil with 3/4 c. cinnamon applesauce rather than the whole cup of oil. I increased cinnamon to 2.5 tsp and added 1 cup of chopped pecans. Dusted with powdered sugar (well, the half of cake that was left after husband got to it!). Had to bake for a total of 52 min before tester came out clean. I'm making this again for Sunday and will try with raisins rather than pecans. Great fall recipe!

So good and so easy! I sliced the apples since that's more of a traditional German preperation, and I substituted the 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil as others recommended. I also added pumpkin pie spice and more cinnamon than it called for. I just kept adding it until I thought it was enough. I put it in a Bundt pan and dusted it with cinnamon sugar and confectioner's sugar. Yum!!!

Incredible.  I lost the recipe my friend in England gave me for this, and I went searching here.  A bit of luck that I lost it, because this recipe comes out so much lighter, so much more flavorful than the recipe she had given me.  Thank you so much for this, I share it often.

I really had high hopes for this recipe, but it just wasn't good at all. The texture of the finished cake is lovely; soft and moist, and not greasy if you cut back on the oil, but the flavor was really disappointing. I used great apples, ones that I usually make my apple pies with, but the cake didn't even taste of apple and smelled a bit on the baking soda side. I even doubled the cinnamon and added nutmeg, but the cake still tasted bland and flavorless, and like anything other than apple cake. I will not be making this again, though I really wish I would have enjoyed this one because the other reviews sound so darn good!

I had a couple of oops moments as I tried to make this cake. I only had 1/3 cup of oil, so I used my son's applesauce cup in addition to. My husband is from Austria and his biggest complaint with american desserts is the amount of sugar we use, so I cut that in half. I added a cup extra of apples. At the end of it was a wonderful dessert that everyone loved. I would do this again.

Absolutely delightful.  More like apple bars than cake.  Moist and chewy.  The batter is very thick and I did better folding the apples in with clean hands, and pressing the batter evenly into the pan again with my hands.  I think this makes the method much easier.

I halved the oil.....added 1/2 cup of light sour cream to keep things moist....used 1 cup of white sugar with 1/2 cup of brown sugar (not packed).....increased the cinnamon to 3 tsps....used 5 cups of diced apples (of various sizes, but mostly very small)...and added 1/4 tsp of cloves with 1 tsp of nutmeg. In a glass 9x13 greased with margarine and dusted with sugar/cinnamon, it took just about 45 minutes. 

It did not come out "fluffy" like the word "cake" makes you think, but it tasted soooooo good! I lightly dusted it with powdered sugar, which made it look a little prettier. I think a serious frosting would be too sweet for our tastes. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Easy to make and it tastes fantastic.  Moist and dense.  I did use half applesauce and half oil and cut the sugar by a half cup and increased the apples to 5c.  There is none left!

I found this recipe last week and I have made the cake three times already. The people I have shared the cake with, love it as much as we did at home. It is very, very easy to make.

This is absolutely delicious.  This is even better than a coffee cake!  I like mine with a cup of coffee and some whipped cream.

Absolutely delicious! It lasted less than 24 hours. Only thing is I thought 1 cup of oil sounded like a bit too much so I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 low fat sour cream. Baked it on Saturday night and on Sunday morning it was SO moist and delicious. I might try adding some raisins next time also.

It tasted just fine but the texture and overall look of the cake really bothered me.  It's not really a cake.  It's so flat it almost feels like a bar recipe.

Turned out great!  I definetly used less sugar and oil than the recipe called for. I also added more cinnamon. I only kept it in the oven for about 25 minutes and even that was too much. Other than that, it was good.

i swear, i'd give it six stars if i could! This cake is moist and delicious topped with a little cool whip and served nice and cold from the fridge. I halved the recipe, substituted applesauce for all of the oil and added chopped pecans. Delish!

I took this cake to an afternoon tea, what a hit.  So quick and easy.  Found it best eaten on the day or maybe I need a new storage tin.  Will make again.

I followed the suggestions of cutting the oil to 1 cup and sugar to 1 1/2 cups and the cake was delicious. I cooked the cake in a bundt pan and sprinkled powdered sugar on top and it was very moist and a big hit for an office breakfast.

I kept envisioning this as a bundt cake so I baked it in a bundt pan and it didn't hold up well when it came out. But it tastes delicious. I will make it again and stick with the flat pan. Also I found I could barely get 3 cups of apples to fold in without totally overwhelming the batter. I probably should have diced them smaller.

I must have done something wrong but this didn't come out well! There wasn't nearly enough batter and it was crunchy and hard. It might have been better using applesauce in place of chopped apples.

this was very easy-  and I took many suggestions that everyone gave.  I decreased vegetable oil to 1/2 cup; I decreased sugar to 1 cup; I did NOT peel the apples!!;(that worked out awesome-never thought to do that in all the years i've been baking).  I did add walnuts and a handful of raisins.   This is a very nice,moist, dense cake.

I thought this turned out great.  Like other reviews said, I used 1.5 cups sugar and 0.5 cup vegetable oil.  I used a 9x9 glass pan and it fit just fine.  I was intimidated by the mass of apples that amounts to four cups, and wish I used all of it because it would have been just fine.  But it really does taste good.

This cake is wonderfully moist and tasty...even better the next day!  I cut the sugar by about 3/4 cup, and it's still nice and sweet.  I also sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar before baking and it made a nice, crispy topping.  YUM!  Thanks.

Very good, everyone who tasted liked it including my 2 kids.  I took the suggestions of the other users and reduced the sugar to 1 cup and the oil to 1/2 cup.  It could even do with less sugar.  Thank you for submitting this recipe

Very good, and has kept well for a week of slow eating.  I did a direct substitute of brown sugar for the white and used extra apples.  It is very, very rich and I think it would probably be good with reduced oil.  If you do use full fat, I reccomend against a frosting!

Excellent,easy *on hand, ingredients. At the last minute my child needed to bring something "German" to school, we made this cake, she decorated it with Betty Crocker Cream Cheese frosting with Red,Black,Yellow Gel highlights.  The 6th Grade class loved it as well as the adults!  I am making for a family holiday gathering...but will decorate it differently.

I made this Thanksgiving morning at 2:00.  My other cake recipe had failed, and I was desperate.  I found this (thanks allrecipes.com) and decided to try it.  It's the most delicious,moist cake I've made....ever!!!  Absolutely wonderful!  If you're debating about whether to try this recipe, stop wondering and make it.    You will be rewarded with many smiles and requests for seconds.  Mine didn't last long.  Thanks Barbara for sharing this delicacy to us.  I made it again last nite for a friend's birthday; the only thing I added was a cup of walnuts.  What wasn't eaten was taken home by the birthday honoree. Oh yes, it doesn't need the frosting; it's wonderful without it.   Yummy.

So good!  I cut back on the oil.  I used 1/2 c of canola oil and 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  This the the first time I made apple cake and I love it.  I made an 8x8 with half of the batter and 10 cupcakes with the rest.  I will be freezing the cupcakes for later use.  I was real nervous because there was no milk or water in this recipe and was extrememly thick,  but is soooooo good!

I made this in a Bundt pan, which wasn't really a mistake...but the crust that forms on the top is so crunchy and yummy, it would be better in a 9x13 pan.  I used Granny Smith apples, per one of the other reviews, and the tartness set off the sweetness perfectly- plus, I loved the fact that the batter is so thick, it holds the apples where they belong instead of letting them 'sink'!

Incredibly moist cake!  I used three large apples, which was probably more than 4 cups, but the cake was wonderful, especially for breakfast. (Shame on me!)  Although I dusted the top with powdered sugar, I think it would have been delicious without any additions.

This recipe was wonderful with MAJOR revision.  I used 3 eggs, 1/4 of oil and 2/3 cup of applesauce.  I cut the sugar in half and make cream cheese frosting with only 3 tablespoons of sugar.  It was moist and tasted even better the next day.  I will definately make it again!

I am terrible at baking cakes but this one came out beautifully - and I even tinkered with the receipe!  I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and added buttermilk for the other half.  Even though I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups it was still very sweet (next time I would use less again) but I had tart granny smith apples which deflected the sweetness. I baked it for 50 minutes in a bundt pan and it came out beautifully - fantastic receipe! Even my husband who becomes fearful when I start baking loved the cake and thought it very moist.

What an easy and unique cake. I was so thrilled i could use up a few apples that i was about to throw out. My husband loved it. So moist and the crunchy top didn't even need a frosting. Powdered sugar was just enough. I can't wait to try it tommorrow as the other reader said it gets better the next day!! I am gona serve this at Christmas time for family. I made it in a glass pan so i did cut down on the cooking time but it was perfect.

I took this to work and it was gone in no time!  The moistness is unbelievable.  I bake mine for about 55 min in a 13 x 9 and it could go longer without harming the cake.  Everyone likes to eat the crust off the top so I feel an icing is unnecessary.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!!

YUMMMY!! This cake was absolutely wonderful! My fiance who doesn't like sweets, LOVED it! No need for icing, great just as it is. I did add about a 1/4 brn sugar and about a tsp of allspice. Not that it needed anything! We had it warm, cool, and then warm again with french vanilla ice cream! What a wonderful treat!
Thank you for posting this recipe. I will make it over and over again! Tommie in Oklahoma

This was decent, but it really stuck to the pan and was so dense.  I also had to put it int for 15-20 min longer.

This was delicious.  I had to bake the cake for 15 longer than indicated, but it turned out perfectly.  I frosted it w/a cinnamon-spiked cream cheese frosting, and it was a hit!

What a great recipe!  I altered the recipe a little - used golden delicious apples, left their peel on, and added more apple than called for - the cake turned out wonderful!  I'm very impressed!  I'm definitely making this one again!

This is a great cake. I live in New England so I always looking for new apple recipes for the fall. I'll definitely use this one again. The only trouble I had was that the batter was so thick I had to add about 1/4 cup water to be able to stir the apples into it.

This apple cake is absolutely fantastic, and disappears in seconds!  Everybody always requests this cake when they come over!  It is especially good when molasses is added....it gives it an extra-rich and chewy texture!

Disappeared in about two days...and that
is only because we are trying very hard to stick to the weight watchers program!
Would have disappeared in about an hour
otherwise I think. It was absolutely delicious!!!!

I don't bake much but this cake is so good that we've made it multiple times! I cut the sugar in half and it's still quite sweet. Also usually use an extra apple, and  sprinkle the top with crushed nuts, yum.

Requires much longer than 45min in my oven, and the mixture is indeed SUPER thick...also looks like there won't be enough dough, but the apples melt away so there is! Delicious!

I may change this to a higher number once I cool it down and taste it. I looks awful! It got so dark brown before it was done. It was shaking like it was liquid at 45 minutes so I had to go more but even at 45 it was so dark and unappetizing. I may find it wonderful, who knows. It still is ugly.

This is a recipe that you must change a thing or two depending on the fruit. To be more specific, sweeter the type of apples you use, less sugar you need to add. I used with its Turkish name "amasya elmasi" which is a relatively sweet, small apple type.  I reduced the sugar amount by like half and doubled the amount of cinnamon, yet it was still a tad too sweet. (I did not make a topping. Just the cake itself.) As long as you make the calculation this is a good recipe for an easy bake.

I followed ingredient directions exactly. I baked it in a bundt  pan and it came out ok. A couple of chunks stuck to the pan, but I was able to get them out and puzzle the cake back together. My error - I don't think I greased and dusted the pan properly. The cake was very light and sweet. I will try to make it again with less sugar. I wanted to taste more apples and less sugar. Still, I liked it a lot. I took it to a potluck and it was well-liked too.

We love this cake!  I wasn't planning to make it for the holidays, but the kids requested it.  We add the caramel sauce from another reviewer.  The batter is super thick, but the cake smells wonderful while baking and tastes fabulous!  Best served warm.  Thank you for sharing!

This was great - I used 3 eggs so it was drier, brown sugar instead of white for depth of flavor. and 1/2 C applesauce  and 1/2 C oil, and added 1 C of chopped walnuts.  Glazed with:  2 C of powdered sugar, 2 T melted butter, 1/2 t. of vanilla, 2 T of milk, and 1/4 t cinnamon.  YUM!  2nd day was more moist than the first but not goopy at all.

Made exactly as written and it turned out perfect.  I used honey crisp apples and diced them into 1/2 pieces.  I thought the dusting of confection sugar added the right amount of sweetness but you could also serve with whipped cream too.  Great recipe!

I added an egg, because the batter seemedctoo thick...but after I added the apples, it seemed too thin, so I added some flour and sugar.  It cooked in time given, and came out moist.  I did like it, but not sure I'll make it again.

I intended to follow the recipe exactly, however I realized halfway through that I only had 1 cup of white sugar, so I had to substitute a cup of brown sugar. Then I decided to follow someone else’s advice and use cinnamon sugar to coat the pan. I also made the caramel glaze another review recommended. The cake was easy to make and took about 55 minutes to cook through. I like it, but I think that the texture is a little grainy. I feel that the cinnamon sugar pan coating and the cup of brown sugar may have caused that. I also can’t really taste the apples. I used 4 gala apples, so perhaps my apples were too small. I wish the original recipe gave us a measurement in cups instead of whole apples, since size varies. Overall it’s a good cake. It’s not overly sweet, but I’d like to try it again following the recipe exactly, except for adding more apples. Even with the changes I had to make sure to the ingredients I had on hand, I still give it 3 stars. I think with less cinnamon, brown sugar, a flour coating and more apples this cake will be divine!

This was a great cake to make for a weeknight dinner with friends in the fall, very easy.  Read the reviews, so I used 7/8 c oil, 3 T cinnamon, 5 c apples, 1 c white and 1/2 c brown sugar.  Dusted the pan with cinnamon sugar.  No icing, just powdered sugar for curb appeal.  Tempted to have a piece for breakfast.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! I have made it several times and the only edit I have is that I've found the bake actually takes quite a bit longer (usually in the neighborhood of 1:15), but other than that, this is consistently a Fall favorite.

I made it and it was delicious. We all could not get enough. I did not want to use oil, so I used a cup of milk instead. Came out delicious.

I may add some oats next time and bake for 10-15 additional minutes.  Will definitely bake this one again.  A nice alternative to apple crisp during Fall!

OMG this is soooo good. I made it for family dinner and paired with DQ soft serve. Fantastic! I did sub 1c sugar with 1c Splenda and 1/5c cinnamon applesauce for 1/5c oil. Everybody loved it.

This is the best apple cake ever! I followed the recipe exactly. The dough will be extremely thick. Don’t thin it out, it really does come out perfectly. Made it in a 13 x 9 pan and it was done in about 50 minutes. The cake looked and smelled amazing by itself, but I dusted it with powdered sugar when it was cool. Everyone loved it! I will make this again and again. Thanks for an awesome recipe :)

This was very good. In my opinion, no need for frosting as some had said they like. I halved the recipe which fit perfectly in an 8X8 glass baking dish. It says half is worth 12 servings, but for our family who really enjoyed this, it was more like 4 servings:) 
I doubled the cinnamon, halved the oil (used 1/4 cup) and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. I also used half wheat flour and half cake flour. As per other reviewer I increased the apple. I used 3 variety apples (probably about 3 cups when sliced) which I think was a little much, next time I will use 2. I want to try a little more spice next time as well because I like cloves, maybe a little allspice and a tad of nutmeg in the fall.  This is a pretty healthy version of an apple cake and much less butter than apple pie. I will make this again, thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe. 
I used 1/2 cup less sugar and really liked the "not so sweet" quality of this cake. There are only 2 of us, so the way a cake keeps is important. It stayed very good until we finished it.

I made this as cupcakes and they turned out beautifully.  Very moist but too sweet.  Next time I make it I will reduce the sugar by half.

I made it exactly as the recipe suggested and it was nice a moist.  My husband thought it should be a little sweeter so next time I will add more crumble to the top.  We put whipped cream on it and that added the sweetness he wanted.  I would definitely make it again.

I know my way around a kitchen and around baking. I followed the directions to the letter and I'm sorry, but I also wound up with a crusty top (not necessarily a bad thing) and a mushy center.  I baked it close to an hour before pulling it out of the oven.

As is, it's rather sweet, not bad if you like things sweet. It will set your teeth on edge if you don't. My husband and son liked it well enough, but I doubt if it will be worth eating after 24 hours, as what little consistency it has will be lost.

Here's the thing. If a recipe requires too much tweaking, I'm on to a different version. If someone has a technique to suggest to make it turn out like even a dense cake as opposed to pudding, I'll try again. As it stands, for now I'm looking for something else.

This is delicious. The only changes I made was to use fat free vanilla yogurt instead of the oil, and I topped the batter with cinnamon sugar before baking. The top was lightly crisped from the cinnamon sugar, which I love. Mine was done at 40 minutes.

I will first say that the recipe calls for way too much oil. I decreased it to 1/2 cup and it was plenty. In fact, the second time I made this I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce and it was perfection! I also decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and increased the cinnamon a bit and added in some freshly ground nutmeg (perhaps 1/4 teaspoon).  And I added 5 cups of apples instead of four. These simple changes brought this up to a five star dessert with the perfect sweetness and texture that my family loves and asks for often.
Oh, and while I love cream cheese frosting, this cake did not need it in my opinion. It is much better served with fresh whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Just not a heavy, sweet frosting.

Excellent recipe; simple ingredients, easy to follow and absolutely delicious. Did not deviate from the main recipe except for adding  the caramel glaze suggested by one of the previous reviewers. It  was a major hit at an Oktoberfest potluck. Will be a repeat for sure! 
Thanks for the recipe and for the simple to make caramel glaze! Finger licking good.

I followed the recipe exactly, and was disappointed. Not sure how this has so many positive reviews. The cake was way too sweet, and while the top and corners were crumbly, sugary and dry,  the bottom was soggy with separated oil. I will not make this again.

I made the cake but without people's reviews and recommendations just going by the recipie this would fail. Amount of sugar is too high and if you follow as it's said here - it would be mostly not eatable :( 
Also would recommend cutting the apples by half slices, otherwise it's not possible to mix it all together. 

But thank you for the recipe, this is really nice and easy!

This was delicious and a great way to use up old apples.  (I used old Envy apples).  Per suggestions from other reviewers, I only used half cup of oil and 1.5 cups sugar.  I baked into little loaf pans for about 35 minutes.  Phenomenal!!!!

Rave reviews in my house for this cake!  I didn't read any of the reviews before I made it.  I used Certified Organic Ultra Clean Supreme Expeller Pressed Coconut Oil, Einkorn Flour, reduced the organic sugar to 1 1/2 cups(which I will reduce to 1 cup next time).  After I put it in the oven, I mixed up 1 1/4 cups of chopped walnuts, 3 tablespoons of organic coconut sugar, 1/2 tsp. Garam Masala Seasoning & 1 tsp. Cinnamon and opened oven up and sprinkled all over cake and then continued to bake until done. Delicious!!!

Delicious! The cake itself is very light and airy, and it’s chock full of apples (I always use tart Granny Smiths) that nicely offset the sweetness. Just a light dusting of powdered sugar is all it needs to finish. Love it!

I cut the recipe in half, added an extra granny smith apple, and made a third of the carmel topping suggested by reviewers. It was wonderful. I will make this again. I understand why one reviewer was tempted to tuck the last piece out of sight of others!

Simple and nice. I reduced oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of milk. I also cut sugar to half and used some  jam to taste. I will definitely repeat this recipe!

Great recipe! Cut the recipe in half. Halved the amount of sugar (1/2C instead of 1C for half the recipe).  Also, used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce. For the seasoning: I used pumpkin pie spice and five spice instead of cinnamon. Also used 4 apples. Moist and delicious.

Easy to make, forms a unique crust-like top, and is great with and without ice cream (or whipped cream). It’s not your typical cake so it’s a nice surprise if you’re making it for guests. But you might end up like me and eating most of it yourself!

A great cake! I used two different types of apples and followed the recipe exactly. It turned out perfect. The cake is moist and bursting with apple and cinnamon flavor. Next time, I might add some walnuts. I'll be baking this one again.

Superb recipe! Made some slight changes, cutting down the sugar to just 1 1/2 cups and changing 2 cups of all purpose flour to 1 1/2 cups all purpose + 1/2 cup whole wheat.  I also added a lot more apple pieces than the recipe called for and put a layer of thin apple slices on top- resulted in a moist decadent loaf. I baked it at 335 degrees for 50 minutes. Sprinkled some cinnamon on top and dug in!

I am the worse in the kitchen. Followed the recipe to this cake to the point, didn't change a thing and it turned out perfect. But someone did mention something about a glaze/ syrup on top (cream+brown sugar+butter) I added that before serving and it was delicious!!! If I can make it, and if it can turn out good with me then anyone can do it
Also, I didn't have a mixer, my husbands arms did the job perfect! :D

Definitely 5 Stars! Super easy recipe.  I followed it exactly. My cake took about  an hour to cook. No idea how anyone could have rated this low. My hubby and I loved it. The only thing I wish I did was to cut it in half because we'll definitely finish it. Not good for my New Year's resolution.

Very good cake. After reading some of the reviews I decided  to use only 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce. Also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I sliced the apples thin. baked in a 9x13 pan for about 50 min. Cake browned nicely on top and inside was moist but baked through.

Very lovely cake.  Had to make a few modifications since I was at the in-law's house and didn't have everything available:  used whole wheat flour and Stevia instead of sugar (about 1 1/2 c), but turned out fantastic.  Maybe a little dense due to the ww flour, but I totally expected that, and was pleased with the texture.  Didn't really need any topping in my opinion, and it was very nice and moist due to the apples.  I would make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe and I've made it several times. Modified spices once but went back to what was written as it seems to have the best balance. I've also made it with firm pears, and actually prefer it with the pears than with apples. A definite keeper, and it is better on the 2nd day. The moisture content of the apples may mean it needs to be refrigerated--if it lasts long enough. A keeper for sure.

I followed Naples34102 advice and stuck to the recipe, also adding the extra vanilla. I also used her caramel sauce to top it with.  I served it to 3 other couples and all 3 women asked for the recipe, amidst many groans of approval!  I have made this cake several times in the past without the topping and really enjoyed it.  However, I will probably never make it without the topping again! So worth the extra calories!

Doubled the recipe for 48 and did it in a larger pan with icing sugar. It’s a wonderfully moist cake and not too sweet and a good way to use up some apples in the fall.

This was a disaster for us.  Exactly as another reviewer (Lori) said happened:  the outside was nearly burnt and the inside was a pile of mush.  It also stuck to the pan.  We did everything according to directions and I've been baking for almost 4 decades.  No idea what went wrong here!

Delicious. Used 1 c sugar, and 3/4 c unsweetened apple sauce with 1/4 c veg oil, as other reviewers suggested. Used my old fashioned crank apple peeler/corer which made it a breeze. Used 2 lg  Granny Smiths and 1 Fuji. Made 5 cups of apples.  Pam'd and sugared a bundt pan and cooked at 350 for 35 mins, then gently laid foil over cake for remaining 15 mins. Perfect. Reminded me of the European model of desserts, not PACKED with sugar like here in US.

Love how moist it is! I also baked mine in a bundt cake, and baked it for about 65 minutes (I live in high altitude so it takes a bit longer), also added Naples (spelling?, please forgive) caramel glaze, but had to make it with half  & half, didn’t have any cream. That little caramel flavor does add something to the cake, subtle hint. I had a few chocolate chips left and tossed those in there. It’s a great tasting cake!

I made this cake using 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 5 cups of apples. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It was perfectly sweet - any more sugar would have been too much.    The cake was moist and delicious and that was still the case after 2 days.  Spouse, sons and grandchildren all loved it.  I did not frost or sugar the top of the cake.  We ate it just as is.  I will definitely be making this again.

I was very skeptical about this because the batter was so thick, but it's amazing!  My entire family loved it and it will be a staple around here.   My son especially loved that the cake part tastes just like  Schnickerdoodle cookies!

i really liked the way it tasted, but it turned out very wet, soggy and  greasy.  Oil was pooling in the middle of the cake.   I"m going to make it again. I used tart granny smith apples and i loved how the tart taste of the apple contrasted with the sweet batter.  I also used one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar.

I don’t like desserts to be too sweet so I used 1 cup brown sugar instead of 2 cups white sugar. I think it was perfect amount of sweetness. I could have used more than 4 cups of chopped apples so next time I’ll add a extra apple or two. Great recipe for mealy apples. Cake was moist and delicious!

The cake is truly delicious. I reduced the sugar by 1/3 cup and still find the cake mildly too sweet. I also cut the oil by 1/3 cup and replace it with applesauce. The only issue I had with this recipe is the cooking time. It needed a good hour and fifteen minutes to cook. At one point I was beginning to give up and thought maybe I somehow screwed up the recipe, but left it in the oven and finally took it out when my knife that I had inserted in the center came out clean. Beautiful cake, I'm glad made it.

Super freaking good.  Think of it a banana bread like cake but with apples.  I used 2 sticks of imperial butter in place of oil so I increased the flour to 2 cups because the original recipe said the batter would be thick and with the imperial it was like pancake mix.  By increasing it, I felt it was perfect.  Cake came right out done at 45 mins and we ate it hot.  Did not even dust it with sugar or put frosting on it.  Very good.

So yummy! I went apple picking and had an excessive amount of apples so i was looking for apple recipes and found this one. I have made it several time since then and has been a hit. Add some vanilla ice cream over it or caramel sauce. This afternoon I ran out of sugar and only had a cup of white sugar left so I added a cup of brown sugar to complete the 2 cups. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and it was so delicious! I made English custard to put over it. It is not the healthiest thing but it is decadent and lush. Just the right dessert for a cool autumn night when you want to cuddle with your babies.

I made the adjustments called for: thinly slice apples, 5 cups apples instead of 4, more cinammon, 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 apple sauce. It definitely baked well but it was nothing spectacular. Maybe it’ll be better the next day.

Nothing screams Fall more than something with apples and cinnamon baking in the oven, and I'm so glad that I picked this recipe to make! This cake is delicious! I baked this in (2) round cake pans, rather than (1) 13 x 9 pan, as I was gifting one to our neighbor, who's wife is out of town. Baked for about 35 minutes, and they were done. This one is a keeper for sure! Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the recipe as is and It Was delicious. However, next time I will use applesauce instead just to cut down on fat and hopefully will taste good too.

We love this cake. I modify the sugar to 1 cup. The apples make it sweet enough. I also do what another review suggested and I spray the bundt pan and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. This is always a hit with or without the extra sugar!

I made this just as the receipt calls for.  I did use confectionary sugar on 1/3 and cream cheese frosting on the other 2/3.  Smells and looks Great!  Taste is YUMMY!

I chopped the apples quite small and topped it with cream cheese frosting.  It came out tasting very much like carrot cake.  

I did make some substitutions due to what I had available in my home.  I was out of oil so I used all butter.  I also ran out of white sugar so I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.

I was worried about this cake because of the bad reviews, saying it was too wet and whatnot. I am so glad  I tried this recipe though. Holy moly was this cake delicious. So moist and the apples seem to melt right into the cake. I am saving this recipe for sure.

This cake should come with a warning label!  I didn’t have a mixer so I used a food processor and the batter was so think it burned out the motor.  Seriously it is so thick and hard to work with. The cake was delicious but I did run into the problem getting really wet when it sat for a couple days.  Overall the cake was delicious

I made it just as written with an addition of an extra cup of apples and 1/2 C chopped walnuts.  Next time I will up it to 3/4 C.  It really added to the texture and taste.

First of all, this cake is moist, delicious, and has a wonderfully unique combination of crisp and chewy textures.  Some small suggestions - it's a bit too sweet for my taste, and the cooking time is too short. I baked it for another 15 minutes which was perfect. Next time I bake it, I'll try less sugar. The cake has a crisp crust and bottom, with moist, chewy apple-ness inside - kind of more like a cookie bar than a cake. Unique and delicious!

This is a wonderful recipe!  The description says it all. It's a delicious, dense, moist cake. There's just two of us, so I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan, baked for 40 min. There's so many apples (that's a good thing!), that it seemed as if there may be more apple than batter. Just plenty of apples through and through. .Don't wait til fall to make this, apple desserts like this one are great anytime!

I wouldn’t make this again. It was more of an apple cobbler than a cake by any means. Texture was very off from what I expected.

Love this cake! As a professional baker, this is on my customers favorite's list !  I did add some blueberries to it. I actually made cupcake pies with it. I started with a sourdough pie crust. I baked it 15 min @ 350degrees F. Then put in the apple cake into the  cupcake shells and added some blueberries per cupcake.  Then I baked them until my toothpick came out clean..25 to 35 min. Cooking. I topped them with whipped cream and a few blueberries.  They were a total hit! I make a big cake the same way.

This cake is a hit in our home, and everywhere we take it (church cake walks and bake sales; office potlucks; and as Christmas gifts).  Have served it with dusting of powdered sugar and also served it plain.  It is more like a cookie or brownie; I put into two 9 x 11 pans and bake about 45 min, then cut into 1-inch squares to serve.  It is dense and rich.  I don't alter ingredients from the recipe.  Love it.

Sooo good! It had the perfect amount of sweetness. I followed a few tips on here. I only used 1/2 cup oil, and 1 1/2 cup of sugar, I also used a spoonful of brown sugar, and thinly sliced the apples. At first I thought I had overlooked it (the top was rather hard) but after cutting into it, it was moist and soft on the inside and the thin top layer added a nice texture. I finished it by sprinkling powdered sugar!

I follow the recipe exactly as it says. Man, I can't believe how much oil and sugar I use, but hey, it AMAZING! I'll make a simple glaze and drizzle it on top and give it during the holiday as gifts. This cake has the consistency of a brownie, it's not light and fluffy, so bakers, don't think you can make this and layer it into a birthday cake.

Undercooked mush - like someone said.  I lost another recipe I had used and this is a bit similar - or so I thought.  I followed the recipe exactly, even to the point of weighing out cups of flour and sugar.  When I mixed it all together it didn't look right but as I've not used this recipe I thought I'd try.

After 45 min at 350F it was nowhere near done.  Wet as wet can be so I added another 15 minutes.  

Total waste of ingredients and time.

I didn't change a thing, except make the caramel sauce, and add as done by other reviewers. This was a unique, huge hit with the family. I thought it came out similar to bread pudding, but that's a good thing! We also gave it a shot of fresh whipped cream. This was super easy to make for me being a beginner in the baking world. 
I will be repeating!

Holy heaven, this is amazing! Made it to take to work this morning. Won't be taking it. Lol! Because why waste such deliciousness on people who won't return my emails? Also because I used a bundt pan. It turned out fine without sticking, but the delicious, crispy top gave way so it's not very pretty. Was going to make a caramel sauce, but not after tasting all the crusty bits I just tasted. Superb! Don't bother modifying this recipe. You can't improve perfection. Gotta go buy apples so I can make it again.

2 cups of sugar is over-the-top sweet! I couldn't eat it, it was so incredibly sweet. The next time I make this I will cut it back to only 1 cup of sugar.

I've tried many highly-rated recipes on this site, and often they don't quite live up to the 4-5 stars.  This, on the other hand, is absolute perfection, and deserves 6 stars.  This cake is AMAZING, the texture is so good and it's so easy and delicious.  I make it exactly as written, but in a bundt cake pan instead of a rectangle pan.  It's a perfect dessert and I will make this over and over and over again.

This was so good! My son said he'd rather have this than a birthday cake for his upcoming birthday! So easy to make! I followed some other reviewers comments and made my own caramel sauce (yumm). Added some additional pure vanilla and used about 5 cups of apples. I used less oil than the recipe called for as well. And for the pan, I used coconut oil and cinnamon sugar to coat it. Took a little longer to cook (maybe 6 more minutes) but turned out perfectly.

This cake is delicious! It's easy to make, moist with a thin crispy top, and has a rich flavor. I only used about 2.5 cups of apples (I ran out), and I used 2 tsp of vanilla (I love vanilla!). However, I recommend eating it within a day or two. Each day that passes the inside be comes more and more moist, by the third day the inside was all mush. Over alI I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this twice the same day ..I really wanted to like it.  I thought I must have messed something up the first time...it just never baked through, then became overdone answer sunken in the middle. . The second time was better, we ate some of it. It was quite tasty around the edges but in the middle it was way too soggy . I'm not I'm sure what I could have done wrong but I won't be making it again.

The new favorite cake in our home ! A few modifications - 1 1/2 cups sugar (half brown half organic raw), 2 bananas and only one apple - everything else stays the same . Add cinnamon if desired .

I made this cake, and it was great. Very moist, light and delicious! The thing I changed was that I used a cup of maple syrup instead of sugar. This one change made the batter consistency perfect. I also added a topping made from one stick of softened butter, one cup of packed brown sugar, and one cup of flour. Mix with pastry blender and top cake. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. 

I baked it for 50 minutes, which was perfect.

Very good cake.  I changed it a little bit, not much.  I poured a snack cup of unsweetened applesauce in a measuring cup and filled it with oil - I would do this again.  I cut the sugar a little, next time I would cut it more.  (maybe down to 1.5 cups instead of 2).  Also, I would not add frosting - way too sweet...it was good without it.  Hope this helps!

Like a few others, I don't know what I did wrong. This cake is too greasy to cook all the way through. It's tasty but just a gloppy, sugary mess. I noticed some recommended reducing the oil and sugar so I may try that. I assume I missed something since so many people loved this. Perhaps it's less "cake" and more "crustless pie"?

***Update to review: After the cake cooled for 4 hours, it was more like cake. The flavor is very good. I still think I will try others recommendations to reduce the oil and sugar.

The dough is rather thick, but the results are really good.
I will make this again, but maybe only half the recipe since we have a small household.

This is so good and so easy to make. I made half in an 8x8.  Baked about 35 min. Used 1/3 brown sugar, 2/3 white. Turned out very moist.  A little dusting of powdered surgery is all it needs. You won't be disappointed!

Wonderful!!!  I took this to our card party last night and it was all gone by the time the night was over!  I baked it in a bundt pan and used a Carmel glaze over the top when the cake had cooled a little.  For the glaze I used 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup cream, brought that to a boil and boiled for 3 more minutes, then poured it over the warm cake!

As suggested, I used 3/4c oil and sugar. I used about 5 apples/ A bit dry. I supposed next time I'll followthe recipe but substituting oil with apple sauce (preference). After topping with nutmeg and icing sugar, it tastes slightly better. It's not a WOW but if youve got extra apples lying around, give it a go.

Used this recipe to make cupcakes.  It made 24 cupcakes that are absolutely delicious.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  Only thing I changed is decreased sugar to 1 cup.  Sweet enough for us.  My boyfriend ate two right out of the oven.  This is a keeper for us.

This was delicious - just as is.  I didn't change anything about the recipe except to cook it longer - about 10 minutes more.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I was unsure of was what size to make the apple dices.  This will be on my regular rotation of cakes.

Yummm!!!  I used grated gala apples (about 5 med apples) and replaced half the oil with apple sauce.   The result was a  very  sweet moist cake which was great with vanilla ice cream.   Next time I will reduce the sugar since the apples add so much sweetness.  (Save a couple calories so you won't feel guilty when sneaking a second piece!)

very good, cut oil to 3/4 cup and drizzled with homemade icing, delicious chilled or warm, similar to bread pudding.

I had to add an additional Egg. But it came  out ok. Its very dense though but does taste good. I can see this will be best with Tea with family and friends.

I make this all the time--it's the same recipe we got from a family friend 40 years ago.  I like to dice the apples quite small so they blend in. I always add walnuts, and sometimes raisins.

This is a very tasty cake, the only variation that I did was to add crushed pineapple in place of 2 of the apples.  It was yum, will make this again

This was easy and super yummy.  I had no issue with the cake coming out too wet.   I used a 9x13 pan and it was done in the time specified. I sliced my apples thin. Topped with powder sugar and fresh nutmeg.

Really good! I used 1.5 cups of sugar instead of 2, 2 cups of apples instead of 4. It turned out great, but took longer time ~ 70 minutes to cook. Highly recommend the drizzled sauce mentioned earlier in the reviews.

Made this cake to take to an informal dinner party. Followed directions to a T and it rose so high in the bundt that I thought it would spill over! When cooling it sank down and the edges were sweet and crisp. I added a little glaze per another members suggestion and that sealed the deal! It was a HUGE hit! This is a keeper! Thanks!

I made it as is, didn't change a thing with the ingredients and it was fabulous!  Moist, tasty and easy to make.  I set the timer to 40 minutes instead of 45 and then checked it to see when it was done since ovens vary.  Mine was done at 42 minutes. Topped it with powdered sugar.  Everyone loved it!  Will definitely make again!

Fantastic cake! So moist, so flavorful. Somehow there is a slightly crunchy top after baking that is so delicious. We will definitely be making this one again. Served warm with powdered sugar sprinkled on top.

Really good, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. However way too sweet for my taste, I'll make it with only 2/3 of the sugar next time. Took a bit longer to cook too, around 50-55 minutes for me.

Delicious!  Didn't change any ingredients.  After reading some reviews about the cake being too wet I did alter the process of adding the apples. I masserated and nuked my sliced apples for just a few minutes.  After they cooled I reserved the juice and used it in a glaze for the warm cake. The cake was tender and moist but not too wet. And the glaze was a nice touch.

Served 1 day after baking, with warm caramel sauce.  Sauce over-powered and left us wanting more flavour (spice) from the cake.  Enjoyed another piece 2 days after baking (without caramel sauce) - much better.  Cake was more moist and had excellent flavor.  Worth a try and makes a big cake.  I made in a 23cm ring tin and found I needed to cook longer than recipe indicated.

Amazing cake! Mine did not bake properly at first but probably because I used 8x8 baking dish instead of 9x13.  Everyone loved it, it tastes great. This is definitely one of our favourite recipes. Make sure you don't bake it an a smaller dish, if its too tall it won't bake properly in 45 min at 350.

This cake was an absolute hit! I did make a few small changes, although I'm certain the recipe as written is perfect.

Substitution: 1/2 cup each coconut oil and applesauce (no veg oil on hand); added an extra cup of apples just to use up what we had and an extra tsp of cinnamon. 

We drizzled it with homemade salted caramel and served with vanilla bean ice cream. Absolutely divine.

The best part is the crunchy crust on the top of the cake!
I love this cake, I now make it every year for Christmas (It's a lot of work to do more than once per year). I bake it in a bundt cake pan for about an hour but the cake is so moist that it always falls apart when I try to take it out of the pan. If you have a nonstick bundt pan AND you grease and flour it a lot you may get lucky and it will come out in one piece. But when you cook it in a bundt pan it's hard to get it cooked enough. However it tastes amazing even if its a mushy mess that doesn't stay in one piece! I also cut my apples pretty small and thin. Don't put any icing or anything on it, it really doesn't need it. Although now that I think about it, some vanilla ice cream with it would be great.
I like this much better than apple pie!

The recipe is easy to follow and to do, but I can't really eat the cake, finding it overly sweet. If I do it again, I'll use one cup of sugar, instead of two.

Next lime I'll only add 1 1/2 cups of sugar but it was delicious! My daughter asked for an apple cake for her sixth birthday and was very pleased with this cake. I think i may experiment next time with walnuts and cranberries.

This was an Absolutely perfect recipe!! Wife loved it, and so did her friends. Follow some of the others advise, cut back on the oil and sugar, and made the Glaze as one of the others suggested. Use both glaze and powdered sugar. This was a Hit!!! Definitely a keeper.

If you like gooey, sugary desserts, then this is for you. I will not make this again. The "cake" was extremely sweet, the taste of the apples was lost, and it was difficult to tell when the cake was actually done baking. I made one and a half recipes and baked it in glass baking dishes with parchment paper for over an hour. I can't even imagine what this would taste like with frosting!

This recipe AS IS (which is how I made it) is far too sweet for my liking. Next time, I'll leave half the sugar out. Still a delightful treat, however; perfect with a hot cuppa joe on those chilly, autumn mornings. Thank you for sharing!

This cake was AMAZING. My whole family loves it. When baking cakes, I always cover the pan in oil and dust it with sugar (grandma's advice) and it makes all my cakes come out with an almost crunchy outer layer. I did it with this cake and the contrast of texture between the outer layer and the soft, moist inner part made eating it such a wonderful experience. Almost like eating apple pie! I made a vanilla glaze (butter, milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla) to pour on top. I did not anticipate how sweet this cake would be so I think next time I will reduce the amount of sugar. I will also have it bake a little longer to make the cake more firm. Over all, this was fantastic. I'll be making it this Thanksgiving.

Delicious cake!!! I only made minor changes: placed cut apples in a bowl with lemon juice until use (they don't turn brown and give extra flavor). Added 1tsp of baking powder, used brown sugar instead of white and baked at 360 for 1 hour. Sometimes I make my own lemon frosting and put on top or inside: 1 stick of cream cheese, 1 tsp butter, powder sugar, lemon zest, pinch of salt. Just whip! This cake is the best!!!

I cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, doubled the vanilla extract, and added extra cinnamon. Otherwise, followed directions and the cake came out perfectly after 45 minutes, and got great reviews from all who tried it at a recent dinner party! I will definitely make this again; no need for frosting but it can certainly be served with vanilla ice cream, custard, or whipping cream for an extra delicious dessert!

Absolutely delicious with some changes.
  Oil - 2/3 C apple sauce, 1/3 olive oil
 Sugar - 1 C brown, 1/2 C white
 added 1/2 tesp. nutmeg
 Vanilla - 2 tesp.
 Flour - 1 1/2 C all-purpose, 1/4 C wheat germ, 1/4 cup grnd flax
 Same cooking time 45 mins.  Fabulous!  Bake in a 9x13 pan or it won't cook properly (will be mushy).

I made this twice, once for practice to see if I wanted to make changes and once for the potluck event I was attending  I did not make any changes to the recipe. I did however, make the "test" cake as a bundt and baked it about 10-15 min longer. The "event" cake I baked as instructed. They were both very good. The bundt version did cook a tad much against the bundt pan. I topped both versions with powdered sugar and both cakes being so moist began dissolving the sugar within several hours. The bundt lasted me a few days and was best on day one and gradually got more moist to almost soggy as time progressed. The 9x13 cake was perfect and lasted only that day. I will make this again sometime. My wife wasn't a huge fan but, she doesn't like apple pie either so...not too surprised there.

Followed directions perfectly. However, after 45 minutes in the oven, the cake hadn't risen and was still quite gooey in the middle  Left cake in the oven for another 15 minutes.  Top was quite hard and cake had collapsed, and the middle was still somewhat gooey.  Not a very good recipe.

Kepler and Shanna quite liked it. I used 4 cups of frozen apples - kept them frozen, chopped them up and added them when called for. It worked out well.

10/16/19 UPDATE:  I still keep coming back to this recipe each fall and make several throughout the season.  I always get rave reviews for this cake from everyone.  I do use 5 medium size apples each time, and don't bother measuring out the 4 cups.  I always frost it with a browned butter type frosting/glaze and do it in a bundt pan.  This stays moist for days, and is a favorite for sure.   super moist, and will keep for many days without getting dry.  the amt. of cinnamon is perfect; not too much to take away the flavor of the apple, but just enough.  I made this in a bundt pan and the 45 min. was perfect.  I replaced all the oil with unsweetened applesauce and it was super moist! I do think I would decrease the sugar by half a cup the next time, as it was plenty sweet.  thanks again.

Super simple. Very thick, like cookie dough, but trust it. I followed the recipe exactly and used all Granny Smith apples which have a slightly tart flavor that's a nice contrast to the cinnamon cake. I baked it in a bundt pan for 1 hr and 10 minutes and it stuck a little but not too bad. All edges have a crunchy crust which is delicious! It's not the prettiest when turned out of bundt pan, but it's so good it won't last long. You could glaze it if you wanted to "dress it up" but the flavor is good without it. Enjoy!

This cake was delicious! I did make two substitutes.... instead of the oil I used Greek Yogurt. Instead of white flour I used whole wheat flour.  It was truly delicious. I loved the texture/density of the cake. The house smelled wonderful while it was baking!

This was awesome, and my house smells fabulous! As suggested by a couple of reviews, I cut the sugar - to 1 & 2/3 C, and will cut again next time for health reasons. 

I also aadded an extra teaspoon of cinnamon. 

Cooked it in a bundt pan coated with Pam, and took out after 55 minutes as a previous poster had said. 

Too busy to make caramel sauce suggested by the most helpful poster, Naples, but did drizzle President's Choice Caramel sauce over and served with low fat Cool Whip. 

Yummmmmm!

Delicious. moist, and flavorful cake! The cinnamon is perfect along side the apples. Although I think that 3 cups of Apples is too much. 2 cups should suffice. Will make this again and again!

This cake is amazing. I made it as written except for liberal use of cinnamon. I liked it so much I made it twice in three days. I even ate it for breakfast. It's so easy as well. Plus, as an added bonus it makes your house smell wonderful. I also think that it would be extra special specials waved warm with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.

Very good cake. My guests loved it. I can get distracted, but I'm pretty sure I followed the recipe correctly.  The batter was way too thick so I added another egg, and the batter of course loosened a bit. Baked it at a slightly lower temp and a bit longer and it turned out perfect. Hot or cooled this is a good tasting treat with coffee or tea. Had the house smelling heavenly too.

Easy, delicious and a big hit! 
Used 1/2 cup oil + 1/2 unsweetened apple sauce; 
1 cup white sugar + 1/4 cup brown sugar; 
5 cups apples (5 medium-sized apples); 
added a few chopped walnuts and yellow raisins. 
Served with caramel sauce (butter, brown sugar, vanilla extract, cream, a few drops of rum; let cool for ideal consistency). Cooked in angel food cake pan (buttered and coated with cinnamon sugar) for 58 min. Will make again!

I used to have a great apple cake recipe but lost it, so I was looking for a new one, and this caught my eye because of some of  the great reviews.  I made it today and was very disappointed.  It was dry, tasteless, and overcooked; there was no moistness to it at all.  I won't be making this again.

This is the best cake I've ever made! Crispy toffee-like exterior with a moist crumb inside. I used half Granny Smiths and half Fuji apples and baked for 55 minutes in a bundt cake pan. Before serving, I reheated the caramel sauce I made and drizzled some on the cake. Each slice was accompanied by a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and guests had the option to drizzle more caramel sauce on the cake and ice cream. Everyone loved it. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you for sharing it.

I made this wonderful cake  just the way it was written except I added about a cup of vanilla yogurt to the mixture before the apples. I also baked it for 55 minutes. It was amazing.  The only change I'll make next time is by cutting the sugar by about 1\2. The sugar in the apples more than makes up for it.

I hate to modify recipes, but I did make 2 adjustments based on others' reviews. I did 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 oil. I also did only 1 cup of sugar. I can't comment on how the texture might have been different with more oil, but I promise you will not miss the extra cup of sugar. This cake is so yummy.

I always love finding a simple recipe like this to adapt into a vegan cake. I cut the sugar down to one cup and used brown sugar instead of white. To make it vegan I removed the eggs and added an extra 1/4tsp of baking soda. I also used whole wheat flower for a more rustic cake. Lovely results, but I definitely think 2 cups of sugar plus the apples would be WAY too sweet

So yummy! Easy to make and able to use substitutions and come out with a beautiful cake. I used coconut oil instead and think it would be better with brown sugar but it still gave a really nice crispy top and caramelized bottom. I needed a recipe that used apples as I had extras and something that was dairy free as I was taking it to a party where the host is severely allergic to dairy. Best of both worlds and soooo delicious!

I was looking for an apple cake like the one a friend made for us years ago. This looked close, and it's great! I cut back on the sugar a bit, about 1/2 cup less, because our apples were so sweet. Just what I was looking for!

Great, easy recipe.  I sub'd 1/2 cup apple sauce for 1/2 cup of the oil and I added 1 cup walnuts pieces and probably more apple than it called for.  I also sprinkled raw sugar on the top so it had a nice crunch.   I ate a huge piece right away and then gave some to my neighbor because it was sooooo good I couldn't help spreading the yum.

Made this a couple of times now. We all love it that i will continue to make it as often. I prefer to bake it in a bundt pan, comes out perfectly baked! Also lessen the oil and used apple sauce instead. Came out just as prefect!!

My wife does not care for cake at ALL, but she absolutely loves this.  The apple trees on the property line had a bumper crop this year.  I wanted to remake a childhood favorite of mine, my german "Tante Minnie's" Apfelkuchen, but could not find the recipe.  Her's was a thin cake with apple slices laid in rows.  Our apples were not the prettiest, but ooh-so-tasty, so I figured that a recipe that didn't visually showcase them might be better.  THIS IS IT.  I must have made this at least 14 times over the past two months (five at one clip for a bake sale) and it is simply amazing.  I am 3/4 German and 1/4 Italian, so therefore there is definitely generous measure on the cinnamon and vanilla.  The only thing that I've added (which maybe doesn't even make a difference) is to sprinkle brown sugar on the top of the batter right before it goes in the oven...

This recipe is great if you plan to eat the whole cake over a day or 2. The flavor is awesome, easy to make. However...this cake does not store well. It gets super mushy. I have only made it 1x, but will try to make some adjustments to it. The top also cooks much quicker, so the middle you really have to watch. I'm thinking maybe doing a 8x8 and covering with aluminum so the top don't burn. If you have a group of family or friends, this will be a hit w/ a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

LOVED this cake!! I used cake flour, 1 c. sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar, diced apples in big chunks, an extra sprinkle of cinnamon in the dry ingredients. 5 c. apples: granny smith and pink lady.  I put it into a bundt pan and cooked it for about 40+ mins( depending on your oven) it came out pretty clean( just a smidgen under:-) Perfectly done and moist, not heavy at all.....EVERYONE loved it!! I made the caramel sauce that everyone raved about on the site too and it was a lovely mixture together. You will not go wrong with this cake. As one of my girlfriends said" This is the ultimate taste of fall":-) Enjoy!!

I usually make a recipe as stated but do shy away from oil.  I subbed 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil.  I also added the caramel sauce suggested by naples34102.  I took this to work & it disappeared in no time!  Two days later I made it again for office party we were having & everyone is so happy to see this cake again.  It is tasty & moist.  Like this much better than Jewish Apple Cake.

Excellent!  At first I was worried because there seemed to be so much more apples than the batter, but it turned out fine after baking.  Used honeycrisp apples!  Also added3tsp  cinnamon and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg plus few more dashes.  Used the full cup oil.   It was very sweet as is, so if I do the caramel glaze in the future, I will cut down on the sugar in the cake itself.     Yummy!  Will make again.

Update:  the full cup oil made it sooo soft and difficult to cut.  I made again with 3/4 cup applesauce.  It made the cake soft but lost that nice crust.  So, ideally stick to oil, but maybe reduce to 1/2 cup?   Also, I reduced sugar to 1 cup and it was perfect.  Definitely doesn't need 2 cups.

Made it 3rd time, used full cup oil.  Used 1 and 1/4 cup sugar, because it was for a party.  But use 1 cup only if making for just us.  Also increased nutmeg to 1/2 tsp which is perfect!

Got a lot of compliments on this.  Rather time-consuming to peel and chop apples, and I diced into very fine pieces.   Coated them with lemon juice to stop them from turning brown.  I did add 1/2 teaspoons of ground cloves and nutmeg.  Based on other reviews, I tried to reduce the oil, but not adding any other liquid (or applesauce) made the batter very thick and I burnt out my hand mixer.  Ended up adding the oil back in because I had no applesauce in order to mix.   The batter did loosen up after adding the apples.  After spraying pam, I coated the glass pan with cinnamon/sugar mix and once cool, sprinkled confectioners sugar on top.  Thanks for sharing.

Easy recipie. I made it in a bundt pan and cooked for 45 mins (in an electric oven) to perfection. I swapped half the oil for applesauce and cut the sugar to 1.5 cups. Still amazing. I think perhaps adding some nuts next time might be good. Made a quick rudimentary vanilla butter glaze for the top which was light and didn't detract from the cake itself. I think a thick/creamy frosting would be too much. The cake is good enough on its own.

Given that my husband is German born and raised, he loved this cake as is! So you can't go wrong doing it exactly as written. However, for me I think reducing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups next time will make a nice difference. Or I'll go with using only Truvia Baking Sugar just to see how that pans out. The spice is just about right and I used 5 different apples to equal 4 1/2 c and they all mingle well together perfectly. Granny Smith, 1 each golden and red delicious, Stayman and pink lady. I made the caramel sauce and poured that over and it really tasted wonderful. It's very dense but will thin very slightly once the apples are added. I also dice the apples last so they aren't sitting around and immediately add as soon as finished.

I added more apples than it called for and it still held together. I suggest making the apple pieces as small as possible to make it easier to cut.

This is definitely good but maybe a little a sweet for my tastes. I did like the density of it which I think is characteristic of a German cake. Husband loves it but I'm more partial to the Romanian apple cake recipe on this site.

After 45 minutes in my convention oven at 350 degrees F, the entire top was "mushy".  So I turned off the oven and I kept the cake in for another 45 minutes as the oven cooled down. 

The top was still mushy but the sides were "done".

Added more apples.  Maybe 5.5 cups.  Also replaced half of the oil with applesauce.   So good- I would make it again this way next time.  Added basic vanilla glaze after it had cooled 
(1 C powdered sugar, 2 T milk, 1/4 t vanilla).

This is very popular at potlucks.  1.5 cups of sugar is perfect....2 cups is way too sweet.  I also used 3/4 cup oil + 1/4 cup apple sauce.  5 cups of apples is perfect.

Very easy to make and came out looking very nice!

I just gave this recipe a shot after reading so many great reviews about it. I started to question this recipe at the point of folding in the apples to the batter even though the recipe states that the batter is very thick. It does become easier to fold and stir with the apples.
The cake is out the oven and looks good except for that I used a 9.5 bundt pan for this cake and the cake turned out very short and small. I would be curious to double the batter portion.
Also, I will have to try the tips give by others for greasing the pan and sprinkling sugar because unfortunately even after greasing and flour prepping the pan, I lost parts of the top of cake when removing from the pan.
I will definitely give this recipe another go!

Best apple cake ever.  I didn't change the recipe.  Very moist and dense.  Easy recipe.  The cake is so good that I don't want to put a frosting on it.  I think I'll just finish it off with confectioner's sugar.

PERFECT and such a buttery mouth feel! I don't even know how this recipe is SO perfect, but it is! I didn't change anything. But maybe it feels buttery cuz I used the Kitchenaid to make sure the egg/oil blend turned a creamy yellow. This cake ends up tasting like there are two sticks of butter in here. I used 2 large granny smiths (that were withered and left in my fridge after a 2 week vacation--hence the search for a recipe to use them up). No need for frosting in my opinion, this is a great coffee cake. My 6 year old son has requested this for his next birthday cake!

Moist, flavorful and surprisingly light.  Not a dense, heavy cake.  Delightful cookie-type crunch on top.  I did usee half brown and half white sugars.   increased the cinnamon to 1 Tbsp because my family loves it. Great!

This is a really great recipe once I added an extra egg because it seemed a little dry. I added a topping after reading previous reviews. I was going to follow napels' recipe for the topping but I realized I did not have cream halfway through and changed it up to 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of softened butter. Cut it in with the pastry cutter and spread on top.

Very nice dense apple cake. If you don't like very sweet cake cut back on the sugar. I used 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 cups. The Batter of this cake is very thick before you add the apples and needs to be folded with a wooden or metal spoon. The cake is delicious and I think it would be even better with some walnuts in it....

I lost my old favorite recipe and found this one to be as much like it then any other.  I cut the oil down less 1/4 cup and the next batch I used my whole wheat flour making it even more interesting and a bit more healthy.  Fabulous either way.

I had never made an apple cake before but I made this cake for a co-workers birthday and it was a hit! I followed the recipe and used cinnamon sugar on the pan in place of flour. I made a caramel pecan topping, which just put it over the top. This will be one of my new favorites!

Made this because I wanted to heat up my apartment by using the oven and boy was I surprised! It turned out so moist and I didn't need to add any extra topping or icing. Brought it to work and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I didn't alter the recipe but for leaving off the powdered sugar topping. I'm making it again today for thanksgiving! Thanks for a great recipe!

Super apple-licious cake! I slipped when removing it from my Bundt pan, and half of it was a pile of crumbs! Yikes! So I ended up shmooshing the crumbled pieces into an 8x8 square glass baker. Topped it with Smuckers caramel topping, and, BAM! That is one awesome cake. Will make it again, and maybe let it cool in the pan a little longer before attempting to de-pan it.

Man oh Man oh Man was this good! It was moist! Stayed moist! The only alterations I did were changed the oil to butter, and I chucked in some butterscotch chip (which really, this cake doesn't need)! This has been added to my repertoire of cakes. This, I would serve to guests who come for tea or something along that line.

I made two of these cakes to the T.   The first one I put in a bundt pan, and when I went to flip it the cake stuck and tore half the top off.  I think if you use a bundt you need to cook this way longer.  I started over, and made another one a few hours later in the 9 x 13 pan.  This cake turned out fine, but as someone else said it does not keep well.  This is an eat right away dessert.  It had deflated quite a bit the next day when I took it to a church fellowship.  I made caramel sauce for it, and kept it warm to pour over it.  Without the caramel sauce it would have been just ok.  This is a right out of the oven cake.  I would never make it again if we were not eating it right away, and I would not make it without the carmel sauce for sure.

It ended up total mush on the inside after an hour of cooking while the outside was starting to burn.  I was checking it every 5 minutes after the 45 minute mark and it was clear something was not right.  The batter was not only thick but very grainy with sugar.

outside cooked really well in a bundt pan, but inside was super gooey- ended up microwaving my slice for a minute to thoroughly bake my slice.

WOW! Amazing cake, guests loved it. Baked in a bundt pan, which took about 15 minutes longer to fully cook. Just did a simple glaze using powdered sugar and apple cider.

Very moist cake! I followed this recipe as written, and the outcome was a very moist and delicious cake.  It reminds me of the cake an elderly woman at my church would make during pot lucks when I was a child. Next time I will adjust the sugar based on the apple's natural sweetness as I though it was too sweet for my taste.

Delicious! Only change was coconut oil instead of Vegetable, half brown sugar, and I shredded my apples in food processor. Carmel sauce on top is nice addition but not necessary. Very moist cake and yummy cake.

I'm not sure if it was just me, but it took much longer to bake. It also crumbled when I took it out of the pan. The taste is amazing and oh so moist. Perfect with a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream.

If you are looking for a good cake recipe to use up a lot of apples, with simple ingredients and not a lot of fiddling around, this is a winner. I coated the bundt pan in cinnamon sugar because I happened to have lots on hand, but no substitutions necessary. House smells heavenly- thank you for sharing

I changed nothing, however; I did make one mistake.  I had 4 apples cored/peeled/sliced and used them all. I am not sure how many cups it came to.  BUT, I am going to make this cake very soon! I have five gallons of apples to use, and this is a very tasty way to use them! Perhaps cupcakes next time. Also, It was perfect without frosting. I dusted lightly with powdered sugar.

My mother introduced me to this recipe, and it has become a family favourite!! I've made my own alterations by using whole wheat flour (in part or in whole) and adding a dash of ground cloves, thereby giving it a nutty flavour and reducing the caloric content.

Soooo good, but I think other reviewers are right in saying to use less sugar. It was a tiny bit too sweet, but other then that, perfect!

Great recipe! I didn't change a thing, but I did make the simple carmel sauce but I halved it and just drizzeled it over the top. I'll be making this again.

Everyone in my family loves this cake exactly following the recipe. The only change is I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. This is only because of a vegetable oil intolerance. The flavor of the cake is so strong (and yummy) it masks the coconut flavor.

I tried this when looking for a cake with the ingredients I already had. As such I changed it just a bit, but It was still amazing. It exceeded my expectations by far. I substituted 1/2 cup coconut oil for the vegetable oil, and ground ginger for cinnamon as I didn't have any. I also added a sprinkling of allspice just because. It turned out incredibly. It is a very dense cake, and it doesn't need icing. The cream cheese icing actually takes away from the pure flavor of the cake, I did however add a little to the center of the cake for those in my family who love icing, however a little powdered sugar goes a long way. On a side note I had to cook it for an extra 20 min. to get it to stay in cake form.

I've tried the recipe it was pretty tasty. I lessened the amount of oil and sugar and increased cinnamon amount as others suggested. I also used cinnamon and sugar instead of flour to coat the pan. For icing a used a half of stick of cream cheese, 2 1/2 tbs margarine, 2 tbs milk, 3/4 cup confectioners sugar chopped walnuts and dates. Oh yeah and also a tbs vanilla extract. You can adjust measurements according to your taste preference. Thanks for the advice and for this awesome recipe.!

The cake is absolutely fantastic! I used all ingredients written in the original recipe and did not change anything. It is really easy to make. I love the spongy taste and the fresh apple "kick" it delivers. I used confectioners sugar on top and it tastes wonderful. I will definitely make it again.

I am giving this recipe three stars because it did not turn out the way I expected.  I did change a couple of things but didn't think that would change the recipe that much.  First, I used a little more than 4 cups of apples.  I had about a cup of apples sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon left over from an apple crumb pie, so I used those apples along with some additional plain apples.  I also used two loaf pans rather than one 9 x 13  pan, and I sprinkled the pans with a sugar/cinnamon mixture rather than flour.  The loaves did not bake through, even though I baked them much longer than called for  -- at least 55 minutes;   the center of the loaves were soft and wet.    I think this happened because I used more than 4 cups of apples, and one of the apples was very juicy.  It is a little hard to judge because of the consistency, but I think if I make this again I would cut down on the sugar and definitely use only 4 cups of apple.

Love this recipe!
Just make sure your apples are sliced thin, or even grated.
I add a cream cheese frosting for extra sweetness.
Absolutely delicious.

Super simple and delicious even my ridiculously picky child ate it.  I wasn't so sure when I mixed the batter (super thick, paste-like), but came out delicious and moist.  I used half brown sugar.  It was a little sweeter than I like, so next time I'll reduce by a bit.

D.e.l.i.c.i.o.u.s. I ate 3/4 of this cake the first day I made it. Not exactly proud of that fact, but...wow. I love this cake. I also did the 1/3 c oil to 2/3 c (homemade) applesauce substitution. T.a.s.t.y. Had to cut back on the sugar quite a bit because I don't like things too sweet, but the taste is simply phenomenal. Can't wait to make it again

Delicious!!! I followed other recommendations by using half white sugar and half brown, half white flour and half whole wheat.  I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I also left the peels on you can't even tell!  Mixture will be very very thick but cooks up moist, dense and oh so good!

Loved this.  I made it for Book Club with a few changes.  I halved the batter but kept the full amount of apples.  Used a smaller pan.  The brown sugar/ butter topping made the cake.  I have also made this with rhubarb Nd it is just as good.

Well, I must have done something wrong because the middle of this cake wasn't done.  Despite this, it kind of turned into an apple-cinnamon fondant and was absolutely delicious.  May need to adjust the baking time though!

Followed recipe to a T accept didn't peal apples, and chopped them up with a hand processor.  For me I would add raisins (because I love them) next time.  Lovely refreshing cake.

This cake was fantastic as is. Just a bit on the sweet side, but we loved it in my house. Made the entire house smell like apples and cinnamon. The top of the cake was crispy and the inside was nice and moist. I didn't put any frosting on this cake. My family and I enjoyed it as is. We gobbled it up within a few days. Awesome recipe.

I liked this very much.  But I have a different recipe that I like a little better.  I I'd like the crustiness of the top, though, and I did sugar-cinnamon line the pan.  I also served it its a caramel sauce.

Made this for my son's first birthday, exactly as written.  It was delicious!  I also made the glaze recommended by others (butter, brown sugar, cream, vanilla) but didn't use it because the cake was perfect as it was.  Per.fect.ion.  Will make again!

The most delicious apple dessert I've ever tasted! I topped it with a caramel glaze and sprinkled with toasted walnuts, absolutely delicious. It took a great amount of restraint not to devour the entire cake in one sitting! I used gala apples, which tend to be very sweet, and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cup. It was still a tad too sweet, next time around I will reduce the sugar to 1 cup.

I really enjoy experimenting and trying new dessert recipes so it is uncommon for me to go back to one and make it again, even if it came out well (which is usually the case).  That being said, this is one I have gone back to and without a doubt will again. Easy to make (dicing the apples is the most work) and absolutely scrumptious - crunchy top and moist, delicious interior.  My family (most of whom claim they are "not big on sweets") loves this cake and many of them have asked me for the recipe.  I don't make any changes to the recipe other than adding an extra cup of apples- I use a combination of Golden Delicious and Granny Smith and would recommend this to anyone looking for a suggestion for good baking apples.  Adding extra apples does not effect the cooking time in my case - the cake is always perfectly done at 45 minutes.  Everyone's tastes are different, but I personally find this cake to be perfect without any kind of topping- It just doesn't need one.

Very good.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and baked in a 5x7 loaf pan.  It took quite a bit longer to get done (no fault for the recipe).  It was just a little too moist for us and only got worse, almost, just almost soupy after 2 days.  I'll move on to another apple cake.

I used to make a chunky apple cake in the eighties but lost the recipe so I'm really happy that I found this.  I made a few changes.  Used only 1/2 cup of olive oil,  three eggs (I added the third to make up for some of the liquid) and just under 1 1/2 cups sugar (I included a small amount of brown sugar in that scant 1 1/2 cups), and I used five apples chopped into  pieces.  When I first saw the batter, I couldn't believe it would fill a 9 x 13 pan but once I added the apples, it fit perfectly.  Then I sprinkled a little sugar and cinnamon on top. It came out soooo good.  Took a little longer than 45 min but I think my oven temp is off.  Wow.  This is really delicious. And the inclusion of brown sugar gave it a nice dark color.

This cake was delicious. I'd say it's more of a coffee cake than dessert cake, though. I made it in a bundt pan, which for some reason did NOT work (I'm thinking it was too moist because of all the apples?) - it plopped out of the pan in clumps...but I'm sure a 9x13 would've worked fine. It was pretty soggy even by the late evening of the first day, which I don't mind too much, but by the next morning it was mush. I made the caramel sauce (1 stick butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup heavy cream, boil 3 minutes then add 1 tsp vanilla) that some others recommended and it was delicious poured on top!

Baked this cake for the first time last night. Bakd it late to have for breakfast. My husband and sons didn't wait till the morning. Only had half of the cake left by morning. Per my husband it is the best cake ever. I did make a few adjustments; used 1/2C brown sugar, 1/2C white sugar, 1/2c splenda, 1/2c crasins, 1/2tsp butter flavored extract, only used 1/2c oil, and 1/2c margarine. Soaked the crasins and diced apples in the oil and 1/4c rum, majority of alcohol evaorates when cake is baked. Super moist cake with execellent flavor.

This cake is fantastic. If you need to go lower fat, sub in some applesauce. You lose some of the crunch, but the taste is still amazing.

Fabulous cake! It is very sweet and I did use BELEWBUBBLE's idea of using cinnamon sugar rather than flour to line the tin which is wonderful. I will cut down on sugar as they did too to compensate for this next time. A really lovely cake, thanks so much!

First, it made the whole house smell so good, we couldn't wait to taste it. And it was excellent!
I used onkt one cup of sugar and added some dried cranberry. I think some walnuts will add some crunchiness,  will try it next time :-)

Followed the directions exactly and doesn't look like the picture.  Falls apart easy.  Thinks there is just way too much vegetable oil but I put it in a bundt pan.

I wanted to make an apple cake. Instead I made an apple crust with mush underneath. It tasted good, but wouldn't come out of the pan well even though I greased and floured it. My husband thinks it stuck to the pan because there's too much sugar in it. That makes sense. If you want to make this cake, don't follow the recipe to a T, follow other reviewers advice instead.

Followed it to a T and it still was not done. Took over an hour to bake and then still wasnt fully done. Very mushy on the inside and really cripy on the outside, its mor eof a bread pudding than a cake.

this was a great tasting cake 
I used 1/2 cup of oil and 2.5 tsp cinnamon with granny smith apples.
However, next time i will use a shallow cake pan, not a deep one.
It took so long for it to cook throughout with the deep baking dish and also made the top too hard

I was extremely disappointed in this recipe. The cake was very heavy and the inside was complete mush. I followed the recipe to the T and baked the cake to the required time. However, I did try a part of the outside and found the taste was good. People who decide to make this recipe DRASTICALLY reduce the oil.

I used applesauce for the vegetable oil and Splenda for the sugar. It made a wonderful guilt free treat! I will make this again using my modifications, one with carrots and one with zuccini.

I made this cake in a bunt pan.  I followed the recipe except one small change.  I rand out of white flour so I had to use 1 C. white and 1 C. whole wheat flour.  But wow this cake was so amazing and I'm really glad I didn't pour a glaze over it or frost it.  Does not need it at all.  My only complaint is I didn't really taste the cinnamon that well and there is A LOT of sugar in it.  Might tweak the recipe a bit next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely love this recipe.  Only did two things differently, I used about 4 1/2 cups apples and I used applesauce instead of oil

Delicious cake. Following advice of others, I used 1/2 cup of oil, 1 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for white.  Added raisins and walnuts, coated pan with cinnamon sugar. It was still a bit too sweet, so I might reduce the sugar a bit next time.  Definitely a keeper.

MMM MMM MMM I have tried this recipe with less sugar, less oil, without any modifications, made it a total of 7 times now.  This is an amazing recipe good for novice or pro.  Lori F. who said it burned on the outside and mushy on the inside, perhaps check your ovens temp.  This is a no fail recipe.  Absolute wonderful comfort food.  Once in a while I do add a struesel topping, but would not recommend icing it.  Perfect with a cup of coffee, for brunch or as a pot luck.  Thank you Barbara for a wonderful staple in our home.

Let the cake cool completely before icing or covering to fully enjoy the crunchy outside and the moist inside. I always asked for this cake on my birthday and 50 years later, it's still a family favorite.  Mom's version includes a cup of pecans, and 1 tsp nutmeg replaces 1 tsp cinnamon.

This is a fantastic cake with no changes. It is a little wet when cooked but that is from the apples. I received tons of compliments.

Crazy good! I didn't have a 9x13 cake pan so I used a slightly smaller heart shaped casserole dish. It turned out perfect, just took an extra 10 minutes of baking. This will be a favorite in my family.

This was absolutely delicious and fool-proof!  I was actually trying to follow the directions exactly, except that I wanted to double the recipe.  I took the 4 eggs out of the fridge to let them get to room temp, and thus didn't start baking until a few hours later.  I then decided to make one cake first just in case my mixing bowl wasn't big enough, but I accidentally used all four eggs!  I only realized my mistake after transferring the entire mixture into the baking pan!  I decided to just pour it back in the bowl and try to double it. I mixed the second round of oil, sugar and vanilla separately, poured it in, and then add the dry ingredients and just stirred, stirred, stirred by hand.  I thought for sure it would flop, but no, it was delicious!  Definitely a keeper!

OMG, this is GREAT! I don't usually comment but I feel compelled. I followed the recipe exactly except I used a 9 x 11" glass dish to bake in at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. I could have baked longer but my husband & I like a little "gooey-ness" to our desserts. The consistency is similar to bread pudding. The taste VERY sweet (could use less sugar if you're trying to be healthy) but not overly sweet. Perfect winter dessert! I'm going to serve with Fat Free Cool Whip & coffee. Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!!

#1 Don't make this in a bundt pan, you won't be able to get it out.
#2 I did like the way it bakes up nice and crunchy, love the texture, however, the cake is too sweet.  My husband and I agree that you can't really taste the apples or cinnamon, all you can taste is sugar.  I will look for another apple cake recipe, once was enough for this one.

Great easy recipe. I was afraid that it would be too dry because the batter was so thick. I kept the recipe as it was written.  I put foil over the cake the last 15 minutes because the top was getting to brown.

One of my favorite cakes! This recipe would be five stars if it didn't suggest 1 c. vegetable oil, it's unnecessary. I only use 1/2 c. and it comes out very moist. I leave the skins on the apples (why remove them..??), only use 1 c. sugar (half white, half brown), always in a bundt pan and bakes for 40-45 min. The cake is amazing on it's own but even more amazing with a little homemade cream cheese icing. Use only a half block of cream cheese when making the icing and swirl it right on top! Yummmm.....

DELICIOUS! I followed the directions exactly and it came out so wonderfully, with a delicious crispy topping. to keep it from getting soggy the next day, I stored it under paper towels (or use a kitchen towel) in a cake server.

The only change was the oil to 1/2 cup and I baked in bundt pan for about 55 minutes.  I also used the caramel glaze that's on this site. I made it for my dad's birthday because he wanted an apple cake and everyone loved it!!! thanks

This cake has become a family favorite fast. I grew up with my Grandmother's apple cake recipe, which everyone loved, but this is so much better than her cake! I didn't change a thing, I followed the recipe exactly.The kids love it with no frosting, just a bit of powder sugar. This is keeper, trust me!!

This is a wonderful recipe!  Moist and flavorful!  But I also tweaked it just a little after trying it.  I replaced half the oil with water (the original recipe is a bit greasy),  I used only 1/4 tsp salt.  Since I was using very sweet apples I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I  also didn't peel them.  That gave the cake a little more texture though the cooked peels are very soft, and you get a little more vitamins and fiber.  It seems it might also be good with walnuts - maybe sprinkled on top with some chunky sugar crystals.  Enjoy!

This is a great cake, I followed others notes and used 3/4 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil.  the only downfall was I felt there were to many apples (or I cut them to large) I ended up making another 1/2 batch of the cake minus the apples and put it on top.  In the end it was delish!  I served it with whipped cream and everyone loved it!

This was fabulous!  I used Honeygold apples and cut them in large chunks instead of dicing.  I also baked the cake in a bundt pan which lengthened cooking time to over 1 hour, but boy was it worth it!  I took another cook's suggestion and made a caramel sauce and that just took the cake over the top!  VERY easy and super yummy!  I will be making this cake again soon!

This is the first apple cake I ever made and it was AWESOME!  I'm not sure why some people commented that it wasn't.  I followed the directions, with the exception of subbing half brown sugar for the sugar part.  I also took the advice of others and made the caramel sauce...OMG, to die for!  I am a pretty decent cook but you don't have to be for this recipe.  I will say the batter is extremely thick, almost peanut buttery, but it all cooks together and is absolute wondefulness, especially with vanilla ice cream!

This was fabulous. When my daughter was stirring the batter, she thought something was wrong because it was so thick and goopy, but I assured her that would change after the apples were added to it, which proved to be correct!  I served this for a Rosh Hashanah meal, and it was a hit!

Favorite recipe ever.  It really doesn't need any frosting, just a dusting of confectioners sugar is enough.  If its not all gone as soon as it comes out of the oven I suggest reheating and adding a scoop vanilla ice cream :3

Loved this recipe, have added it to my favorites! I baked it in my Bundt pan, and used butter and "sugar" instead of "flour" to prepare the pan--gives the crust a little more crisp from the caramelization of the sugar.

I've made a similar apple cake for years with a few adjustments:
Add 1 teaspoon of nutmeg.
I use my handy apple/peeler/corer/slicer and don't dice the apple slices - I like to see and taste apple.
I bake the cake for 1 hour. 
For our children I make it in a bundt pan.  Remove cake from the pan and cut the cake in half, making the shape of the letter "S" which resembles a worm.  I put gummy worms around the plate for decoration.  
Frosting: Beat 3 oz. of cream cheese and 1 T butter until soft and fluffy.  Add 1 t vanilla, a dash of salt, and 1 3/4 C powdered sugar.  This cake is very good and easy to make.

My husband loves this cake and he is not a dessert eater. I use a mandolin to cut the apples into very, very thin slices and since the batter is so thick, mix it all together really well. I also add some all spice into the batter and use a greased bundt pan to bake following the directions of another review on here and it comes out wonderfully.

Delicious cake! I made this for my German meal of pork chops with apples and onions, potato salad, and red cabbage. The cake is supermoist.  I used 1 cup of Stevia and 1/2 cup of sugar (could have used less) and 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil. I also added more cinnamon and vanilla just because. We will see how much is left tomorrow!

I don't have words for this recipes...My mouth is still watering for another bite! It was so amazingly tasty. I followed the recipe all the way. I did top it with the caramel sauce (1/2cbutter,1/2c brown sugar, 1/4c cream. Boil 3 minutes, pour on.) I am so glad that I did. I split the batter between 2 loaf pans and it turned out beautifully. Thank you so much for this recipe. My family decided I have to make this a regular. :)

Awesome! Loved BELEWBUBBLE's idea of sprinkling cinnamon sugar in the pan instead of flour -- brilliant! I did replace the oil with 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 oil. Used Red Delicious apples which were perfect for this cake -- soft after baking.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was sweet and moist inside, a bit crunchy on the outside.  I got a lot of compliments on this.  I made it in a bundt pan, baked at 350 for 45 minutes and it came out just right.  It is a bit sweet (which i like, but not everyone does)so I didn't add any confectioner's sugar or icing to the top.  Perfect as is!

This was just so-so for us, a bit bland I thought (I made as written). There wasn't much cake throughout the apples, which was ok but the cake was, as I said, bland. My least favorite part was the crust that formed on the outside of the cake- not a tasty crust, but a super crispy-like shell. I noticed in the pictures that some cakes had this and some did not, so not sure why it develops on some. It did soften the next day, however. I probably won't make this again.

I made the original recipe and it was fantastic. Mixing the apples and batter together made me smile and know why those German women are "sturdy". I especially liked the recipe because it uses pantry staples so it can be made without planning a shopping trip.

I brilliant cake! I used 1/2 cup of avocado oil instead of 1 cup of vegetable, and am glad that I did. However, I also put in 1/2 cup raisins and only 3 cups of apples. While I don't regret the raisins, I highly recommend adding in the full 4 cups of apples. It just isn't as nice or moist without them.

They came out beautifully with the gorgeous crunchy top that everybody's been talking about. Mmm. I put the mixture into a muffin tin and reduced the cooking time by 5 minutes to compensate for the edges.

Highly recommended recipe.

Great recipe. I decided to try this recipe when I had a bag of mixed apple varieties and I was scared they would go bad. I did use a mixed variety of apples and the cake was successful - nothing beats the cinnamon and apple combo. I must say, though, that 2 cups of sugar made the cake a bit too sweet. The next time I make this cake, I think I will use only 1 cup.

This is a lovely cake, however, after reading other reviews I did the following: 
*Added 1tsp of baking powder to make the mixture rise.
*Used 1cup raw sugar and 1 cup apple sauce not 2 cups of white sugar.
*Covered with foil for around 40min's to stop it from burning on top and being raw in the middle. Take the foil off for last ten min's and you get a nice top. 
*Topping- an apple sliced thinly and pressed into the top of the cakes, 1/2 cup of walnuts, 30g butter thinly slithered, 1tbs of raw sugar and 1tsp of cinnamon (Layer on top). 
The mix made a round cake and loaf (It's a lot of mixture) It was so yum we ate most of both cakes throughout the day...you just can't stop eating it!

I followed the advice of some of reviewers and cut back on the amount of sugar (1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar), increased the amount of cinnamon to 3 t, and used applesauce instead of oil. I also used a bundt pan and didn't bother with any frosting or 10X sugar on top. I really like this cake alot. I'm sure it would have turned out very good if I followed the recipe as is, as well, I was just trying to cut down on some of the sugar and oil as a personal preference and I love lots of cinnamon. Thanks for the recipe!

This was great.  I made it yesterday using Cortland Apples.  They say the recipe keeps well, however it was so good it didn't last long!  Taste and texture were great - I baked it in a bundt pan and like another reviewer suggested I greased the pan and substituted a cinnamon sugar mixture for the flour coating.  All in all a great recipe.  In the future I will add a bit more cinnamon, nutmeg and a pinch of ground cloves - just for my personal taste.  Great recipe Barbara - Thanks -  I will be making this again this week for a dinner party!

This is easy to make and delicious!.  I made some adjustment made by other reviewers.  I decreased sugar to 1 1/2 c. and use 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce as a substitution for 1/2 cup of oil.  This is a keeper!

DELICIOUS!!  Huge hit at the apartment.  All my friends loved it.  Cut down the sugar to 1c brown sugar and did 2/3c oil.  I also only had 3 granny apples.  Baked for 45min.  Came out great!!  The lower sugar makes it suitable for breakfast (probably could even go down to 2/3c).  Comes out nice and moist.  Super good!

Omg! This turned out great! Very addicting! I used an apple-peeler-slicer and cut the pieces about the size of a nickel. I added walnuts and divided into two smaller pans. Baked evenly. Delicious plain.

This cake is excellent, absolutely delicious. The only problem I had with it is that the center never cooked. 45 minutes was about right for the edges, they were bordering on burnt so I didn't want to leave it in any longer, but then the middle was so uncooked as to basically be raw batter. I'm going to try it in muffin tins and see if that makes for more even baking.

Very good recipe!  I used 1/2 cup applesause 1/2 cup oil.  I also made this with Splenda and used a quart of sliced apples I canned over the Summer.  I took this to volunteers who watch our kids during  our MOPS meetings at the church.  Everyone loved it!  I did bake this in a Bundt pan as well.

Delicious!  I had about 10 apples that were getting old and needed to do something with them.  I doubled the recipe + 1 egg just because my eggs seemed small.  I used bundt pans and they turned out great.
I did use half butter and half oil.
I did not even get out the mixer for this one.  A whisk worked just fine.

Yum! Everyone at small group loved it. Used 5 c of apples instead of 4, and used 1/2 c applesauce and 1/2 c oil instead of the 1 c oil. Used 1 1/2 c sugar instead of 2. Baked a little quicker than called for.  (Also made 1/2 recipe in 8x8 pan.  Baked at 350 for 35 min.)

I have made this twice already.  I use 4 peeled and diced apples and I substitute applesauce for the oil.  I just used the apples I had on hand.  Gala and Rome.  Everyone loved it!  It doesn't last long.  I agree that it does get very "moist" the second day.  It must have something to do with the water content in the apples.  No matter.  It's still delicious.

Made this for my husbands birthday cake..he dosent like sweets but he DOES like Applesauce cake. I had tons of apples this fall and wanted to use them up! I give this 5 stars even though mine fell apart..I had a hard time getting slices onto plates. I think it was because I put it into a bundt pan not what was recommended. The flavor and texture (other than falling apart!) was wonderful. Moist with a crunchy outside. I just dusted with powdered sugar. I will make again and highly recommend it.

Delicious. A little one the sweet side for my German in-laws, but when I bake it for them I reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup. I bake it in a 28cm springform pan lined with parchment paper. Skip the frosting, serve with whipped cream for a traditional German cake.

Wonderful recipe!  I used only 1/2 cup of oil and added about 3/4 cup of homemade applesauce.  It saved a ton of fat and it is perfect without the extra oil.  I will make this again.

We used the original recipe, but it seemed that the other reviewers were right:  the oil could be reduced or replaced.  (e.g.,  3/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup oil in place of the cup of oil)  I used the carmel sauce suggested by another reviewer, and that helped a lot:  " I took it over the top by pouring over a caramel glaze: 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 c. brown sugar, and 1/4 c. cream. Bring to a boil, then boil 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Let cool just slightly before pouring over warm cake."  With less oil, I think that this could be a 5-star.

I made the cake exactly as it was given, with the exception of course of reducing the recipe in half and putting it in a loaf pan. It was amazing!! My mother absolutely loved it too, which is who I made it for as an alternative birthday cake. Make it, you won't regret it!

Just like everyone says, "Yum!" Rustic and comforting, this has almost a  bread pudding feel to it.  Did use just slightly less sugar and more cinnamon than indicated, but the original recipe would have been perfect too. We topped off with whipped cream but will try different variations in this most versatile cake recipe: could add oatmeal, walnuts or pecans, cranberries.... The conf sugar dusting would be nice as would a caramel sauce, ice cream, brandy-laced  sauce, etc.

This was fantastic!!  I made this for my husbands and grandmothers birthday and everyone loved it.  I did use half applesauce and half oil, but that was just because I was out of oil.  Perfecto.

I made this cake for my son's German class Oktoberfest.  It was the first dessert to disappear.  I will definitely make it again.  I made it according to the original recipe and put powdered sugar on top.  In the future I will try to reduce the oil by adding applesauce and may try the vegan version described here.

AMAZING!  Very flavorful without being overpoweringly sweet.  I added in a few teaspoons of nutmeg and cloves to make it a bit more fall themed and the smell alone while baking great :)

Wonderful! The batter was wetter than I anticipated. Maybe that's because of the amount of apples the recipe calls for in relation to batter.? I served it warm with ice cream for guests. I was told it better than apple crisp. The next day I warmed myself a piece with some caramel sundae sauce on top. mmmm!

Very good.  My hubby loved it!  Made as written except I had a little less oil than it called for.  Better the second day in my opinion.

Oh my goodness!  I made this cake for my daughter's second grade class and they loved it.  Parents called me to tell me how much they and their children loved it!  Given the age of the students I thought dicing the apples could have been a choking hazard so I sliced them paper thin.  Yum!

So the top does crisp up nicely (for the first day), but everything underneath it is mush mixed with apples.   While I like a moist cake, this is too moist.  The flavor was sweet plus apple.  I couldn't taste the cinnamon.  My husband felt it had a strong apple flavor and liked it for that, so I'm giving it three stars.  But I was too distracted by the sweet mush to enjoy the apple part.  I had this recipe in my box for 2 months and kept wanting to make it.  Now that it's apple season and I have, I was very disappointed.  :(  I won't be making it again.

This cake had really good flavor, but in my opinion, needed a bit more spices. Due to dietary needs,  I used applesauce in place of the oil, 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and 3/4 cups each of Splenda and brown sugar Splenda. I made Caramel Frosting III from this site, again using Splenda brown sugar and 2% milk (no cream) which I drizzled over the cake.  It was a great complement to the apple flavor. This cake was very tasty and well-received by my guests.  I will make this recipe again.

I made this recipe exactly to the directions and I found it a little too sweet too much cinnamon.    Next time I will adjust the sugar and cinnamon.

This recipe is wonderful!  I don't make any adjustments to it and it always turns out perfect.  If you manage to keep some longer than a day, the cake actually gets more moist and yummy the longer it sits!

Really excellent recipe! The cake turned out really crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside for me. Just the way I like it. I used only half of the sugar as my apples were plenty sweet and I just don't like it that sweet and it turned out beautifully.

This cake came out fantastic!!! A little crunchy on the top, but super moist inside! A perfect autumn cake. This was definitely a big hit in my house! I didn't change a thing, maybe next time we will try it with a cream cheese frosting!

This cake is fantastic.  I love it and so does my husband.  I made a half batch and it came out perfect.  I kept the ingredients at half except added a little more cinnamon, since hubby loves it.  Super good!

I never had an apple cake before so I have nothing to compare to. This recipe is very yummy. I did reduce the oil a tad and replaced it with applesauce. The cake was very moist and a nice fall treat.

I made this with the following mods: cut the oil in 1/2 and added 1/2 cup homemade apple sauce to substitute.  Cut the sugar back to 1.5 cups.  Used 50% all purp flour and 50% whole wheat. This was a really nice cake that I am definitely putting in my repertoire.  Makes a nice moist cake with lots of cinnamon and apple flavour.  Very yummy.

This is absolutely the best cake.  I used cake flour because that is what I had on hand and also cooked it in a bundt pan for around 55 mintues.  It is just wonderful.

Good, but a bit greasy. I would decrease oil to perhaps 3/4 cup next time. I reduced sugar to 1 cup and cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon for our tastes.

This was a good recipe - I substituted applesauce for half the oil, used half whole wheat pastry flour, and cut the sugar down by 1/2 cup - it was still plenty sweet so I may decrease it more next time.  I also didn't chop my apples very small and liked the big chunks.  I used probably an extra cup of apple.  The cake was moist and delicious.

This was awesome cake, I made it for my son's 1st BDay.  Rave reviews from everyone.  I did sub whole wheat pastry flour for the AP and halved the oil and added .5 cup applesauce. I don't know if it will keep because everyone devoured it, even my brother who doesn't normally eat dessert had two pieces.  I made the caramel glaze suggested by naples34102, and that totally rocked!  But it was good plain too.

Amazing- very dense and moist. I cut mine into squares and rolled in powdered sugar on all sides. What a hit! I had a bag of aging apples to get rid of and I ended up using about 5.5 cups of diced apples, which still came out great. Also, I always add a shot of brandy to my cake mixes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the T! Delicious.

I've got this in the oven at the moment and followed users advice to 1/2 the oil and found when i mixed in the flour mixture i was left with a very dry heavy cookie like mixture (so i added some apple juice to thin it out so I can mix it)...is this normal?

Wonderful cake.  Very moist and dense with a great apple flavor.  Made one little change, used one teaspoon cinnamon and one teaspoon apple pie spice.  Really doesn't need frosting or confectioners sugar. But, a little scoop of ice cream would be perfect.

Heavenly. Rich and wholesome in flavor without tasting decadently sweet. Used brown sugar and subbed half-whole wheat for a healthier and more robust flavor. Definitely reminiscent of the fruit cakes I've had throughout Germany and Austria--so much heartier than our too-rich and sweet counterparts here!

This was really good. I added a lot of extra apple (didn't measure), substituted half apple sauce for the oil and whole wheat flour for regular. It stayed moist, and some ended up staying in our refrigerator for a week (we left town), but amazingly, it was even better after all that time.

I read all the reviews and suggestions and they were correct. The cake gets mushy after sitting one day. I layered it in a container with wax paper to see if that helped but no. If you make this cake it needs to be eatin right away. I also made the sauce to go on top with the butter brown sugar and vanilla, this definetly made the cake.  It tastes great, easy to make and I will make it again. I will just make sure theres enough people to eat it right away. Thx

I made this just as the recipe stated.  Though, I didn't use top of the line apples, such as Granny Smith or Macintosh.  I just used the apples you get in a bag at the store.  The bread was really tasteless except for the overwhelming Nutmeg flavor that came through.  My 15 year old went through it pretty quick but then again he will just about eat anything.  I ate one piece and that was it.  It's a good thing to make if you want to use up all of your apples but I suggest using some with a really good flavor.

This was really incredible cake. Everyone raved! Only problem was that it stuck when I tried to make it in a bundt pan. I guess I'll try the 9x13. I did 1/2 whole wheat flour (soft pastry) and 1/2 white flour.

So good!! I get asked to make this for work all the time.  I also drizzle a little caramel glaze over the top.

This had a nice crust, I expect from the amount of sugar.  I found it a mite too sweet, though my sugar-holic husband deemed it "juuust riiight!" :)  I will make this again with less sugar and see how we do.

Absolutely delicious - the other reviews were correct - the longer it sits the soggier it becomes.

I had to alter the recipe for use in Japan.  I halved all the ingredients and made it in a loaf pan, and added a touch of allspice and nutmeg.   Unfortunately I wasn't able to find proper apples, as all apples in Japan tend to be soft and sweet compared to a granny smith, or even a red delicious.  To compensate for this I cut down on the sugar a bit and added a bit more flour.  The end result was iffy at first.  The top cooked pretty fast, and the middle was still undercooked, so I had to add an extra 10 minutes to the baking time.  When I took it out the next time the middle had caught up, and the top was a lovely sugary crisp.    If I make it again, I will probably use a few less apples, and maybe layer the bottom of the pan with apples and brown sugar to make it more of an upside-down cake.    Oh well, baking in Japan has always been pretty experimental!

Very good!  But DEFINITELY flour the pan (I did not; used a bundt pan and had to piece the top back onto the cake!)  Made with Caramel Frosting I, which was a good combination.

Great recipe, I made a couple tweaks per some other reviewers suggestions. Reduced sugar and used 1 C. white sugar and 1/2 C. brown sugar. I also used 1/2 C vegetable oil and 1/2 cup C unsweetened applesauce.  I used a bundt pan and sprinkled top with cinnamon/sugar mixture. Very moist cake, delicious for breakfast.

i made this in a 9 x 13 and followed recipe exactly accept i added an extra cup of apples.  it tasted great but by the second day was more like apple mush than apple cake.  don't know what went wrong but i wouldn't make this again unless i was eating it that same day.

I made this cake last night,and by was it good! We had company and they just raved! I made it in a tube pan (jest because I saw the posted picture and liked it!) I felt no need to add frosting or sugar on top. I only used 1 1/2 cups of Sugar and found it quite sweet enough! As others noted, it has a nice kind of crispy top, and then the soft apples in every bite make it absoluty wonderful!THANKS!

Everyone loved it! Moist and rich. I did add more spices and vanilla and substituted apple sauce for some of the oil. Would also taste great with walnuts, I'll try it next time!

I followed the recipe exactly and I have to say I couldn't stop eating it. The surface of the cake (I baked mine in a 9x13) turned out really rough and crusty unlike most of the photos (I baked my cake 25 degrees F lower and 5-10 minutes less than the original recipe and the toothpick came out clean), but it was good still. Frosting is not needed since the 2 cups of sugar really sweetens this cake. My mother wasn't the biggest fan of this cake, but my sister and father couldn't stop eating it also and it was gone the day after I baked it! Thank you for the great recipe! Will most likely make again sometime!

Just made this cake 1/2 hour ago and went outside when I came in it was 1/2 gone.  I quick grabbed a piece and the rest is history, YUMMY!  Followed the exact instructions minus the frosting (doesn't need it).

I brought the cake to a party and it's rave. The only modification is 2tbs of baking powder instead of baking soda. Baked in a 10in round pan. Additional baking time needed, because of the pan I used(?). I also mixed flour/brown sugar/butter with chopped peacon, and sprinkle on the top of the cake for a nutty flavor.

Excellent cake with an excellent texture.  It is moist and dense inside with a slight crispy exterior. Great out of the oven, but still great at room temp.  I did make a few minor changes to adapt to my preferences; I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2C and used brown sugar instead of white and increased the cinnamon to 3 tsp and vanilla to 2 tsp.

Wow! So basic but so good. Very tasty yet inexpensive.  I made a half recipe and only change I made was to double the cinnamon.  Personal preference.  I always double cinnamon.  Also, cut the apple into small pieces.  End result was lots of praise and not much left.  The crunchie top was lost on the second day but still good.  I will try reducing sugar next time but recipe as is was amazing.  If you can't take compliments, pass up on this one.

Wow this is nice cake!  It's pretty hard to go wrong with an apple cake but this is exceptional.  While making this I discovered I didn't have any veg oil so I used a bit of shortening I had left and added apple sauce to make up for the oil.  I baked it in a bundt tin and to my disappointment it fell apart when I took it out of the tin(didn't let it cool COMPLETELY!!) but that did not stop people coming back for second helpings and even thirds.  Not a crumb was left.  Excellent.

OMG ... this cake is absolutely wonderful!  I didn't change a thing.  It turned out absolutely moist and my family devoured it.  I was going to put a glaze on it, but am glad I didn't as it is perfect as is!

I was looking for a good recipe to use up all of the wonderful apples from our trees and this one was a real winner. I took another reviewers suggestion of making a caramel glaze to drizzle over the top and it really made this recipe special. My husband and 2 year old daughter loved this cake. I'll be making this again.

I made this in a bundt pan and increased cooking time by 15 min. I used 1/2 oil (olive) and 1/2 applesauce. I also decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white. My family of 4 finished it in just over 24 hours. Very moist.

This recipe is yummy.  I served it for bingo night and it went over very well.  I used apples that I had frozen. Next time I will use fresh apples.  The frozen apples need to be well drained and dried.  This recipe is a keeper in my recipe box.

The batter is way to thick even to fold in the chopped apples. Next time I would add some applesauce to make it moist. I had to bake it for a total of 90 mins. I was far from being done after 45 mins

oh - my - word ... soooo good! I made this to take to work (Starbucks) to do a coffee pairing with the Breakfast Blend coffee... it was PERFECT!  So easy to make, and I made it in a bundt pan, so I upped the cooking time by 15 minutes (it came out a bit raw, but it was still amazing)  I will definitely make this again, and it got rave reviews from everyone who ate it!  Mmm, thanks for this recipe!

This is a truly stunning cake. I live in a high altitude area, and many cakes don't turn out well. This, however, is a reliable crowd pleaser.

I wood give this a 10 if I could. It was amazing. I followed another reviewers advice and made a glaze.  I have made it with several different glazes and they are all delicious. Have had many people ask for recipe so when I make it to take places now I also print recipes to take with it.

I have made this recipe several times, topping it with cream cheese frosting - it's wonderful with no changes!  Every time I serve it, guests comment on how good it is and/or ask for the recipe.   Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very delicious cake.  Totally awesome.  However, as one other reviewer mentioned, it gets soggy very quickly.  I suspect it's due to the oil to flour ratio.  it begins to deconstruct the very next day so I would only make this again if I were taking it for a potluck or somewhere it will be eaten all at one sitting the same day.

Great recipe!  Substituted 2 cans of apple pie filling since we didn't have apples, and it still turned out great (though undoubtedly gooier).

This was a five star rating all the way! It was international day for the girl scouts, and my daughter needed a German dish or desert, so I made this. I also made cream cheese frosting to top. Great!!

Very moist and dense!  Family really loved it!  It's healthy too, which is great. But I must admitt though that next time I make this, it will be smothered in cream cheese icing lol I was craving icing for it the whole time :)  Worth the time and effort!

This is a great cake, but the oil!  I use 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce and it comes out fine, while cutting back the fat a bit.

Great cake, and not hard to make.  I made it for my son's birthday and topped it with Cream Cheese Frosting II (made with half the sugar, but it still turned out very sweet).  My son, who is 11, said it was the best birthday cake he'd ever had.  I rarely bake cakes so I was happy with how this one turned out.  For myself I think I would have preferred it without frosting, though.

This is excellent.  I made with granny smith apples.  It was different than I thought it would be: there were many apple chunks with dough barely binding them together.  I guess this is why this is do moist, flavorful, and apple-tasting.  My kids loved it!  I can see that it would probably be soggy after one day, but mine didn't last that long!

Great cake. I did find that it got moist after a couple days, but it was certainly still edible and delicious. I halved the recipe and made one round cake because it's just me and my boyfriend usually.

This is the first from scratch cake I have ever made and it was fantastic. I trying to learn how to bake and also do something fun with my 2 year old during the winter. This is a great recipe for beginners and I already had everything on hand. Tastes so delicious especially the next day. It's definitely a keeper.

This is so good! Made it today and between my huband, daughter, friend and me being 8 months preggo it's almost gone! I followed the recipe exactly other than using a bunt cake pan sprayed it with pam and coated it with cinnamon sugar. It took about 50 minutes to cook in my oven. As sugguested by others I also used a glaze. Boil 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 2 tbs of milk. Let cool a little and then add 1 tbs of vanilla. Drizzle over cake and enjoy.

WOW!  This is delicious, moist cake.  I live in 'Apple Country' so I searched for many recipes to use all my apples.  This is my favorite.  
The only change I make is I use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  I love the way brown sugar makes almost anything taste!  I also use a Bundt pan...cake tastes better in a Bundt pan and looks so pretty too!
My only 'issue' is that this cake is SO moist that it does get soggy after just a few days.  So my suggestion is to either many sure that you have enough people in the house to eat it quickly, share with your friends and neighbors or this is a great cake to take to get-together.

I made this for a German themed potluck and it got rave reviews; the three people from Germany all said it tasted German!  The only change I made was to use half applesauce for the oil; I also needed to bake it for ~8minutes extra.

I followed the recipe exactly and topped with a caramel sauce.  The cake is excellent.  My husband even said it might replace his beloved coconut birthday cake which takes hours to make!!  I'll be very happy if it does!

I SO badly wanted to love this cake!  It just turned out a bit...flavorless!  Perhaps the granny smith apples I used didn't give it enough flavor?  I followed the recipe exactly as written and I'm so sad that I can't give this one 5 stars!  I plan to try it again though because I'm determined to make a delicious Apple Cake!

This brings back sweet memories of my late mom, who used to make it. Her recipe calls for 1 cup nuts and only 3/4 cup oil. It's still very moist. I love the different textures of the apples and nuts. Good cake!

I made this over the weekend for a family gathering. It was moist and delicious. I used a 10" tube pan to bake it in and added walnuts. Everyone loved it! I made a smaller loaf version for those who don't like nuts, it went fast as well. I would give this more than five stars if I could. Thanks for a great apple cake recipe that I and my family will be enjoying frequently.

Smelled great baking and tasted good. Crispy top and very moist. Not really a cake texture, more like a very light bread pudding. Made exactly as written and thought it too sweet. Next time will try 1 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar. Also think pecans would add great texture and flavor. Didn't think it was amazing, but will make it again bc was tasty and easy.

This cake has become an instant family favorite. I could not believe how moist this cake was. The semi crunchy top was a welcome surprise. This cake is a keeper.

This is great.  Good taste, nice and moist with a good texture.  This is not a fancy cake, something you might have with tea or as a brunch item.

Awesome!  If you use icing - employ the "less is more" philosophy.  The cake speaks for itself.  Either use confection sugar or drizzle icing on.  Great Cake!

After reading a lot of the reviews I Used Whole Wheat Graham Flour, egg sub, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce & 1/2 cup oil than sprinkled a little cinnamon and sugar on the top as the cake came out of the oven. My husband and daughter don't even know that it is lower in fat. Great Cake that is very simple and quick to make.

Well it is fall and my family is asking again for this cake! It is in the oven now and smelling like heaven! IT IS 8 YEARS now that I have been making this cake.  I know this because my copy was so bad (dirty)I had to make a new one and thats when I noticed the date. It is ALWAYS a hit at parties and truly the BEST APPLE CAKE!

This is a great apple cake. I made it for my husband and I and it ended up gone within one day. Everyone that came over took some home they loved it so much. Looking at the reviews I did add 2 Tablespoons of applesauce and one extra apple to give it more flavor. My grandma keeps asking me to make it again, that is when you know it is great!

I made this cake for an office party we were having and it was a HUGE hit! I did however make some substitutions. First, I did not use 1 c of oil; instead I used 3/4 c unsweet applesauce & 1/4 c oil. Then, I did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. I did not put a glaze on it either since it was already sweet enough. I would have been too much. I will definitely make again!!

Awesome cake!! I love how this turned out, especially the slightly crisp top. It's so good! I used only 1 cup of dark brown sugar, which I think is perfect. Everything else I kept the same! It baked only 40 mins for me, but I didn't bake it in a bundt pan (didn't have one), just a regular 9x13. One of the best apple cakes recipes I've made!

I made the suggested changes. Used less oil substituted it apple sauce and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  My husband loved it.  It had just the right amount of sweetness.  Will definitely make again.

Wow, yummy!

Made it as written except for the 3/4 cup applesauce/ 1/4 c. oil substitution that many made. Also greased and sugared the pan and made it with 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. of brown sugar. 

A definite keeper!

I loved this cake due to its very moist texture. However, I followed other peoples advise and only used half the amount of sugar & half the amount of oil (I substituted the remaining oil with a home made apple sauce). I will definitely do it again

I had never baked anything from scratch before I tried this, and I think I am going to start baking on a regular basis now. I have made this two times now and Ben and I loved it both times! the first time I reduced the amount of oil(as suggested by a reviewer) and it was somewhat dry, so next time I added the full cup and it was perfect!

I don't see what I could could add to all of the reviews, there are so many, except to say that I made it.  I baked it tonight, and addad powdered sugar over the top.  Everyone loved it, and pretty much emptied the whole pan before it was even able to cool completely!  Many thanks for a nice recipe.

YUMMY! This is another keeper. But following suggestions of other reviewers, I also cut the oil in half, used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar and also added a handful of pecans. I think the original recipe would have been a little sweet, because with these minor changes it was just perfect! Thanks for a delicious coffee cake :)

This cake is the bomb!!!  I am not a bigcake fan, but this was very good.  The hubby also enjoyed as much as I.  I skipped the frosting, really no need for it.  It was very moist & tastey.  I followed the recipe exact.  This is keeper & I will be making it again for family get togethers.  YUM-O!!!

Awesome cake! I substituted applesauce for half the oil, and a mix of Splenda and Splenda brown sugar blend for the sugar, added extra cinnamon and some pumpkin pie spice and diced the apples (used 4 big Granny Smiths - about 5 cups). Also added 3/4 cup of walnuts. I made a glaze with confectioners sugar, cinnamon and vanilla flavored coffee creamer and drizzled over the top. Big hit with my husband and co-workers!  Will be using this recipe again, thanks!

Great recipe!  I made it in an angel food pan which I won't do again, broke up but still delicious. I'll stick to 9x11. It's great fresh and also after a few days when it reminds me somewhat of a bread pudding. My Mom, who is German ask me for the recipe and was pleased it is so simple but so yummy.  It's apple-time so enjoy this one!

A delish cake, even when I reduced oil to 3/4 c and sugar to 1 1/2 c, plus used canned apple slices. Sprinkle slivered/sliced almonds on top before baking.
VARIATION: Add 1/2 c chopped dried Turkish apricots to the batter. Delicious.

This cake turned out great. I made it in a bunt pan instead. It took about 10-15 minutes longer to bake than the recipe said since I changed the pan. I also drizzled it with a cream chees icing and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top. It looked great, and made a great addition to our thanksgiving dinner! Thanks for the recipe!

I hate giving bad ratings, but this was honestly very bland.  I followed the recipe exactly.

Reading earlier reviews I cut down the sugar to 1.5 cups and the oil to a lil less than 1 cup. The cake turned out great. Soft, soft, soft! I thought it could have been more sweeter so the 2 cups of sugar would've been fine. More of apple would do I think. All in all it was a good recipe. Thanks for sharing.

UPDATE: Tastes even better when refrigerated!

Very moist and delicious!  I cut the sugar to 1 + 1/4c. just because the other reviewers said it was great without the full 2 cups.  Great use for the 'apple picking' surplus every year.  The only downfall...my kids won't eat it because of the apple pieces (picky).

This was exactly what I had hoped for; a dense, moist apple cake.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  Instead of Cinnamon, I used 'Pumpkin Pie Spice'.  Next time I might do 3 tsps instead of just 2 because I couldn't taste the spices too much.  It was still fantastic and it went very quickly in my house!

I used 1/4 cup light olive oil, and 3/4 apple sauce used a bunt pan. Was very moist and light cake, taste great with whipping cream. Will bake again.

Very nice cake.  I followed some of the previous suggestions and used 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce added nutmeg and extra cinnamon ( I love these spices) and an extra cup of apples. Baked it in a bunt pan and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar when cooked.   Took this to a gathering and it was gone before any of the other desserts,I guess that says it all.

This Cake is awesome!!!
Everyone who tried this cake went back for more, it was very moist and had a lovely taste & texture.... Plus it was very easy to make!
I followed the recipe alterations that another reviewer advised with reducing the oil and sugar......it was PERFECT!
I will be making this cake often!
Thanks!

I recieved this recipie for German Apple Cake from a lady from Scottland that lived across the street from me when I was in college in Vincennes. Scottie would make this for every bi-weekly Americian Leigon Carry-In dinner she attended and always saved two pieces for myself and my husband. :) I always thought it was funny that I got a German Apple Cake Recipie from a Scottish woman! 

Scottie (Agnus) gave me this same recipie when my hubby and I graduated and moved. It is one of my favorites and is is tasty as well as practly fool proof. It seems to be at it's best after is has cooled over night. This is a recipie you simply must try.

I loved this recipe! I followed previous reviews and modified the oil and sugar content. I used 1/2 cup canola oil, 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 cup Splenda and 1/2 cup regular white granulated sugar. I also baked this cake in a bundt pan. It turned out wonderfully! My whole family loved it! Cheers!

Sooo good!  I used a few suggestions and used 1/2 c oil with 1/2 c light sour cream, and 1 c sugar with 1/2 c brown sugar.  I sprayed my pan and dusted it with cinnamon sugar.  This was a quick, simple, delicious cake that is great the first day, and even better the next.  Thanks!

right from the oven and cooled i didn't really care for this. the next day it was a lot more moist (from being covered up) and a lot better tasting.
i think i might try shredding the apples next time as there wasn't too much of an apple flavor for me.

This apple cake is good for what it is, but I personally prefer to use butter in cakes instead of oil.  I would also add more apples, but that is just me. Thanks!

I will be making this cake again. I did however make my own changes, and the results were great. I used 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup homemade applesauce. Topped the cake with whip cream.

Good taste but a little oily. I read reviews but wanted to make it without changes first. I did and next time I'll cut back on the oil. House smelled awesome while it cooked.

great autumn dessert. I added about 1/\2 cup of milk to lighten it up and found that it took about an hour to cook through. I used a warm custard topping to finish it off and it turned out great!

This cake instantly became one of my husband's favorites. He's German himself and after making this cake, he told me that I could bake as good as his mom.It is very easy to make and very tasteful. I just add more apples than written. Thanks for this recipe.

Followed the recipe.  Cake came out perfect.  Very good.  This has quickly become a family favorite.  Next time I plan to adjust the sugar and oil as some have suggested to see how it compares.

This was super sweet and super moist.  I put cream cheese frosting on it, which i would definitely not do again.  The taste was good, but I wish I had read the other reveiws first and cut back the oil and sugar.  I had to bake it about 20 minutes longer than the recipe stated.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have made it a couple times now, reducing the oil and sugar as other suggested and it came out great.  I really like it with cream cheese frosting.  All that I have made it for think it is great as well.

Tastes great, excellent way to use an abundance of apples. Stays moist and flavorful. Next time will halve the oil as suggested, and maybe try a smaller pan to get a thicker cake

I made this a while ago, but I am just getting around to reviewing it now and I followed the recipe exactly.  This cake was so delicious and moist, and I loved it because it wasn't super super sweet.  I used the whipped cream cream cheese icing from this site with it, and it worked really well. I don't even think it would have needed icing, next time I am just going to use a bit of powdered sugar.  So yummy.

Thank you to all of the reviewers for the 411 on the oil and sugar measurments. I was a little put off by the cup of oil and was happy to see that this recipe could easily be adjusted. Baking is not my thing as it's such an exact science whereas with cooking, almost anything goes. Decreasing the oil and sugar resulted in a wonderful cake that my party guests truly enjoyed. Thanks Barbara!

I read all the reviews that said how wonderful this cake would be.  It is good, but not wonderful.  I could see it going over well an office or large function.  One slice is all you need.  I did reduce the oil and sugar as recommended by the other reviews.  It was very easy to make and I did like the cake.  my family liked it also.  but one piece was enough.

Great recipe!  I have already made it twice in the past week.  So many apples, so little time.  Anyone who tried it loved it.  Sent some to my husband's work and I don't think it lasted 5 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe.

A solid, brown, crispy/chewy cake - reminded me of a brownie.  Not as rich, but halfway there.  Better after it sat for a day.  I sliced the apples rather than dicing them, which worked fine.  I bet you could use some whole wheat flour in place of some regular; also applesauce in place of some oil, though it would change the texture.

I made this for our neighborhood Oktoberfest. People really liked it. I tweaked the oil and sugar as suggested. Good flavor and texture but I found it's not as exciting with just the powdered sugar on it--as you'd serve it to  a lot of people. I took a piece home, warmed it and covered it w/ ice cream and it was SO MUCH better.

This was great.  I did cut the oil to 1/2 cup and the sugar to 1 cup like others suggested.  I'll definately make again after apple picking next year!

this is an aweeeeesome cake.i've never made an apple cake before and was a little skeptical since i've even tasted one. it is delicious with this rich caramel-toffee flavour. a little too sweet even though i reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.will reduce it further. but then again, i used red apples because they have a richer honey flavour. i've already had 4 slices. and i also had to bake it longer (about 55 mins) so i covered the top with a sheet of cookie paper, to prevent burning.

I was looking for something different and I found it in this wonderful cake.  I did not powder with sugar or frost and thought it was very yummy!  Nice as a dessert served warm with vanilla ice cream or great as is with brunch.

I followed suggestion from PATAVALON75 and used 3 eggs, 1/4 of oil and 2/3 cup of applesauce.  Cake turned out pretty good.

This cake was awesome!  I served it for a dinner party and apparently one guest begged his girlfriend to get the recipe and make one!  I will definately make this again.  I don't even like apple desserts and I thought it was awesome!  :)

Nice moist cake.  I used a little less oil.  I also greased and sugared the pan instead of flouring it.  This added a little something to the crust since I didn't frost it.  It also prevented that ugly white goo on the outside of the cake.  I thought the amount of sugar was perfect.  This is not my favorite cake, but I will definitely make it again if I have left over apples.

This is a great cake!  You really don't need any frosting at all.  The only thing is the time it takes to dice the apples (we did the dicing pretty small, worked well), but that is certainly NOT the recipie's fault!  YUMMY!  Even my fiance who is a true chocolate and frosting junkie liked this cake.  Very good and easy.  Thanks for the recipie!

Hmmmm, maybe it was just me, but we did not enjoy this cake at all.  It was very oily.  We will not make this again.
