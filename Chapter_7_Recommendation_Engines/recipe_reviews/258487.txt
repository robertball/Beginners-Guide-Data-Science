My healthnut son, who eats no sugar, requested a birthday cake.  I remember attending a class about 20 years ago on how to make desserts with beans.  I recall the taste tests to be favorable.  So, I wanted to try this recipe.  I made one layer as per the recipe-subbing honey for the agave because I had none.  The second layer, I replaced the agave with monkfruit for the sweetener.  It was a semi-dry texture and fell apart if not handled gently.  I may try an extra egg next time to help it stay together and maybe some applesauce for moisture.  I was nervous using the avacado frosting for a birthday.  So, I chickened out (is that politcally incorrect toward chickens? :P) and used buttercream instead.  I will update my review when I make it again with the frosting in the recipe.  I didn't tell my family what was in the cake and gave them each a small slice.  9 out of ten liked the cake.  My son LOVED it!  He took the other half of the cake home to have a sweet treat the rest of the week.
