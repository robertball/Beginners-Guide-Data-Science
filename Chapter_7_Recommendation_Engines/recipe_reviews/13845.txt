This recipe sounded real good on paper.  Once I started mixing the ingredients together, I became a little skepitcal but once I baked them and tried them, oh my gosh!!!  They instantly became one of my favorite cookies!  I did tweak it just a little.  I used 1 teaspoon of cinnimon instead of /1/2 teaspoon and I used about a cup and a half of pumpkin instead of a single cup.  I liked how they turned out.  Another thing, use just a teaspoon full of mixture on the cookie sheet to ensure the cookies are fully done at the 12 minutes and I liked how they tasted when they were just outta the oven versus letting them sit a while then eating them.  I haven't yet tried how they are when re-heated.  Hope everyone enjoys them as much as I did.

Myself and my best friend were given as assignment from our Food Technology teacher to research one seasonal holiday from a country apart from our own. Not knowing anything about American Holidays, we choose Thanksgiving. Part of the assignment was to cook something that was typically eaten on the holiday. After searching for days for a recipe that seemed reasonable, we came across this one. Being from Australia, we took one look at the ingredients and my friend and i both thought the exact same thing : "Man Americans are weird..! Putting Pumkin in cookies..whats next!!?" But curiosity and desperation got the better of us, and we eventually made the cookies. They turned out beautifully, and our teacher even took some home with her! They're very easy to make and taste great!

Made these for thanksgiving and they were well received. I made a few changes just because I can't help myself from messing with recipes even if I've never tried them: I used butter instead of margine and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of white and pecans instead of walnuts and sprinkled confectioners sugar on top.

These cookies were really easy and tasty!  Next time I'll probably add more cinnamon and maybe some ginger as they were very mild... I've entered these in a local fair and won a ribbon!

These are good but I did make some changes. I added some ginger, ground cloves and nutmeg, giving it more of a pumpkin pie flavor. I also didn't have walnuts so I used trail mix (nuts, raisins, sunflower seeds and choc. chips). 
The batter was very oily. I think next time I will cut some of the oil and add ore pumpkin.

This recipe has potential, but was not really very sweet and too puffy.  I added some brown sugar to the second batch before it was really any good.

My Aunt makes these cookies every year except she uses the butter flavored Crisco sticks as opposed to oil and margarine. I made them the way this recipe called for except I used 1/2brown 1/2 white sugar like some other reviewers suggested, I also used 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin and added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. My Aunt also adds white chocolate chips to the batter and then frosts them when they cool with store bought cream cheese frosting mixed with a bit of brown sugar...yum!

They were more like little scones which I didn't mind. I added 1 teaspoon pumpkin spice.  I want more of a crunch. Not bad. Next time I will leave out walnuts.

Very good cookies, very moist! I put my walnuts in the chopper and then added them to the mix, making them very finely chopped. Everyone at home and work raved about them. They even met the approval of a very picky 11 month old! :)

These are delicious!  I made them for thanksgiving "cookies of the month" and they were gone in a day!  I followed the recipe pretty close.  The only changes I made were adding walnuts and eliminating the cloves, and they came out amazing.  The dough is a little greasy, but don't worry.  The cookies come out fluffy and moist. Thanks for the recipe!  These are now a staple dessert in my house.  My husband called them little  handheld pumpkin pies (which is a huge compliment!) so thanks!

changes: 1 can pumpkin, 1/2 cup oil, more cinnamon and added nutmeg and ginger. Not very sweet, which is nice among other sweet desserts. It's very light, but tastes a bit floury. Will make again, but use 3tsp cinnamon and more of the other spices. I"ll wait until the second batch comes out of the oven before I decide though!

This was very good, but a little bland for me, next time I will add some more spices. I too used 1 1/2 cup of pumpkin instead of the 1 cup.

My co-worker used this recipe and brought them to work. Needless to say we ignored our diets for the day. DELICIOUS!!! At work we called them "muffin-cookies". Like the best muffin tops you've ever eaten.

Very quick to mix up and bake. In convection oven baked for 8 min. Made 4 1/2 doz. using tsp to drop dough.  Wished I had read reviews as I had some extra pumpkin left over that I could have used.  I also added some nutmeg and 3/4 cup plumped raisins.

These cookies really aren't bad...they're just not good. There's just no tast too them. I followed the recipe, plus added extras like some of thee reviews said - added: extra cinamon, extra pumpkin, nutmeg, cloves, chopped up the walnuts, even added a cream cheese frosting. I did part brown sugar, part white as this was mentioned in the reviews and other pumpkin recipes called for this as well.  There was just nothing great about these cookies, very blah. I baked them for a party, but they were not good enough to bring to a party and I just left them home

I made some slight changes and these were awesome! They turned out like muffin/cookies for me. I used 3/4 cup of apple sauce in place of the oil and added Pumpkin Pie Spice. I am not sure how much though, I just dumped some in. I also skipped the walnuts and added chocolate chips instead. DELICIOUS!

These cookies get better with time.  The night I made them I wasn't too impressed. They were good but not great.  the next day, once they'd fully cooled and settled into the flavors they were incredible!  Just as good a week later when I finished them.

I have to say when I mixed up the batter I was not sure that these were going to turn out - the batter was very oily (maybe next time I will replace some of the oil with applesauce),but the end result was a very tasty soft muffin- like cookie. I also added 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp cloves and did not add walnuts. Would definitely make these again.

This recipe is a good idea, but needs some tweaks to reach its full potential.  I made the recipe as it is written out the first time around.  It was ok, but could use more spices.  I also noticed that the cookies left an orange/yellow ring on the paper towels from using so much vegetable oil!! 
  The second time around, I used some other suggestions and played around.  I doubled the cinnamon, pumpkin, and vanilla.  Then, I added 1 tsp of ginger.  I substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil and didn't put in as much as it calls for. I made half of that batch, and it tasted pretty good.  It seemed like it would be a good coffee cookie.  For the other half of the batch, I added chocolate chips.  That seemed to add just the right taste that it needed.  I took a huge batch to a youth center and another to a cookie exchange at church (of the chocolate chip pumpkin cookies).  The cookies got great reviews at both places.

I had a cup of pumpkin puree left over from making my pumpkin pie which was perfect to make this recipe. I added ground cloves, nutmeg, walnuts and raisins.  Using a small 'ice cream scoop' was so easy to spoon on small teaspoon-size cookie dough on to the baking pans.  It made approximately 4-5 dozen little soft cookies.  I sprinkled granulated sugar on top of each just before baking.  Yum!

These are super yummy cookies... After you add some flavor to them. I added ginger, cinnamon, and a bit of pumpkin pie spice. I also topped the cookies with Bakers sugar. They have the texture of scones and they pair wonderfully with coffee.  The larger the cookies the longer they take to bake. I used rounded teaspoons and they baked up nice and even.

This could be a good recipe, but it requires some tweaks. First, there is too much oil. Skip the 3/4 oil and increase the pumpkin. I doubled the recipe because I had three cups of pumpkin thawed. The oil wasn't missed at all. The cookies turned out soft and moist. I used Becel for the other fat as it what I had on hand. There isn't nearly enough spice i  this recip eI added (this is for one batch) 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp ginger, and a pinch of allspice. Taste the batter once mixed to see if it suits your taste. The end results were almost spicy enough once baked, but I'd add more salt and possibly some more brown sugar. The recipe doesn't say what size to make the cookies.  I dropped by approximately the size of a golf ball, maybe slightly smaller.  The cookies don't spread or flatten much so this was a good size. The cookies are very soft. They're more like a muffin than a cookie. I'll try freezing them for a quick lunchbox addition. With these tweaks, and maybe some more spice and salt, I'll make them again.

The cookie dough was way to dry made the way instructed, I added an extra egg and an additional cup of pumpkin. I also made a batch with chocolate chips! Both turned out great!

I've used this recipe a couple times! We leave out the walnut. The first time I used a basic cream cheese frosting on top. The second time we got more creative. Topping some with chocolate or white chocolate chips before baking. We used a caramel frosting on some. Then of course stuck with the cream cheese frosting as well. We leave some plain for those without a super sweet tooth. No matter how they're prepared they seem to keep disappearing! I use about two teaspoons of cinnamon instead of the recommended amount because the first time my other half said he couldn't taste the cinnamon.

Made these after Halloween, and used pumpkin from scratch. I made for a very runny batter and the cookies came out way too soft. I may want to tweak this or combine with another recipe that is similar.

I wanted to make some dairy-free cookies, and these turned out great!  I was skeptical about the margarine, but I put in some Earth Balance and it seemed fine.  Great texture and taste!  They were an absolute hit at the office party!

I did not care for these cookies. They have more of a muffin or cake consistency, not a cookie. I added more spices as some had suggested, then made the recipe as instructed. The cookies were bland tasting and as I said, I did not like the puffy  cake-like consistency. My daughter and husband gave a thumbs down on this cookie.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I made a few changes as well. I cut the oil down to 1/2 cup, used 1 and 1/2 cups pumpkin, a tsp and 1/2 of cinnamon, and 1 tsp of ginger and cloves. They came out very moist and cake like. I sprinkled granulated sugar on the top before baking like someone else recommended, but I don't think that did much to add sweetness. I also had to omit the walnuts because my son has a peanut allergy, but I think they still had a TON of flavor. Definitely not a very sweet cookie, but I really enjoyed them! I will definitely make them again!!

Soft, cake like cookies that my kids loved. After reading the reviews, I too added more spices. In addition to what the recipe calls for I added 1/2 tsp more cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also used 1/2 C sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar. I will dfinately bake these again! Something else that might be good would be to frost them with icing...I may try next time.

My husband loves these. He has eaten 5 within an hour of coming out of the oven. It is not a sweet cookie if that is what you are looking for. I added some chocolate chips and put raisons in some of the cookies. I also added some pumpkin spice.

Seems like a lot of oil...I will try an applesauce/oil combo next time.
