I cut the hot dogs in half, but as suggested in the footnotes, cutting them into quarters might even be better for party trays, making them a single bite.  There is little bit of "technique" involved in wrapping the hot dogs and, hopefully, I'll do better next time.  Yes, there will be a next time.  These are easy and tasty.
