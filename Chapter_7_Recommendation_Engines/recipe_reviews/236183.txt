I couldn't find a pouch of  salmon in my area of Canada so purchased a small portion of lightly smoked salmon.  Increased the Greek seasoning slightly as well as the lemon juice and mixed the salmon in with the cream cheese, lemon juice, parsley and seasoning.  As you can see, I ended up with a delightful antipasto lunch with crackers, tomato, pickles, artichoke hearts (my fav) and black olives on the side!

I sampled this recipe for the Virtual Reality event No 7. I used cilantro instead of parsley and missed adding the Greek seasoning to the recipe.  I enjoyed this dip with my favourite corn chips for a nice light dinner.I would recommend this to anyone who has a liking for homemade dips.
