I just made this recipe from directions given to me by my mother-in-law and was going to post it when I saw this.  We call this recipe "copper pennies" and it's always a hit.  These carrots stay good for up to a month in the fridge.  The only modification in my recipe is it only calls for 1/2 cup sugar and a dash of worchester sauce.

Made this for Easter dinner. My daughter and I LOVED it. Unfortunately, my guests didn't. It really is a matter of taste though. Some people just don't like vinegar-y or pickle-y tastes. The tomato soup, I thought, really gave it a nice subtle flavor. If you use Splenda instead of sugar, it's a great diet recipe to snack on.

This is the first recipe where I was so impressed I had to rate it.  I have enjoyed so many recipes from Allrecipe.  This time around I was looking for a recipe using cooked carrots that my husband might enjoy.  This was fantastic.  Have you ever tried to can this?

Tastes good but the recipe is huge for me. Most of it was wasted because it wasn't something we wanted a bunch of times. Lasts well in the 'fridge though.

Really good....made it for my daughter's baptism luncheon, went over well.  Easy and can be made several days in advance, so great for parties.  We served this cold.

I made this according to directions to marinade over-night. it was too sweet. after consulting the buzz, I added 1 fresh squeezed lemon and @2 tbps of worochester sauce. I still hated it. out of 10 people, 4 had seconds.

Tasty. Save time by nuking carrots in microwave (1/2 cup water to every 3 cups sliced carrots, 3 to 4 mins per cup al dente). Added sliced jalapenos for some extra kick/zip. Thanks for the old-time recipe, QUIRKYIQ.

This was a wonderful recipe for summer!  I always have to cook my onions though so I put them in the pot along with the carrots for the 5 min.  The recipe also calls for diced green bell pepper.  I chopped up the pepper very fine.  I like it better this way.  My mom called this recipe copper pennies.

I really don't like carrots much (or vegetables in general) but I was able to eat these.  I know that doesn't sound like high praise, but coming from me it is.  My husband enjoyed them as well.

If you are trying to get your family to enjoy more carrots: this is NOT the recipe to do it with. No-one, myself included, enjoyed this dish.

Sorry, I really didn't like it. There was just sooo much vinegar. I could only taste the acid. I think it would have been better without it.

Similar to one my Grandmother made.  I made it according to the recipe, tried it, and decided I needed to up the vinegar quite a bit to get the tang I wanted. I added about a cup more.  Next time I think I will skip the soup because it made it too sweet for me.

I loved this recipe. Serve it at at Fibers of Love lunch. I used 3 lbs of baby carrots for the FOL group. Wished I had made more so I would have had leftovers. I might make this for the Shaw Family B&B.
Leslie had a recipe that included mustard and worcheshire sauce so I will make that one instead in the future.

We really liked this recipe.  It's very different from any other carrots we have made.  It's really vinegary though...probably not for everyone.  Don't make it for the first time when having guests...but thats my rule for every recipe.  If its your family, and you need something different, try it.

Just wanted to say that these are called copper carrots in my neck of the woods and were served cold at my wedding reception 33 years ago. An oldie but a goodie.
