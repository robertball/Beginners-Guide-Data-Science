Nice! I only had jasmine green tea - which I find more "delicate" than black. I decided to use 2 bags to be sure and really liked the way this came out. The water/rice and cooking times are perfect - brown rice can sometimes be a stinker to get right. Thanks! :)

Loved this recipe!    I used it as a side-dish to accompany baked salmon.  I didn't have the cilantro, so I used basil.  It turned out great!  The Jasmine aroma and flavor was very delicate but grasped my attention every bite I took.      I added a pinch of cinnamon on a whim.  I feel it helped bring out the Jasmine flavor a bit and kept the basil from overpowering everything else.

This adds a very, very subtle flavor to the rice. For me, the change was so subtle that it isn't worth repeating.

This was a really nice recipe.  It is hard to decide how to rate the recipe because it really only adds a very subtle jasmine flavor.  But I thought it was fun to mix it up from the typical water and rice cooker dish.  I used this in a Thai cashew chicken dish.  My only problem with rice in cooking is the quantity of liquid v. rice to use.  This was about right.  Thanks for the recipe.

Tasted more like a bullion cube then jasmine. But it had a nice flavor overall. Next time if I am pairing this with an Asian entr√©e I would skip the cube.

This was so-so for me. I didn't find that the jasmine tea nor the vegetable bouillon added much extra flavour to the rice. I tasted the cilantro the most out of any of it. It was simple and easy to make though, which is a plus!

This was very bland. Without the cilantro, it would have been too bland for my taste. The cilantro added just enough zing to make it palatable. It went OK as a bedding for the sesame beef I made.

Agreed.  Very delicate flavour.  Maybe more tea needed.
