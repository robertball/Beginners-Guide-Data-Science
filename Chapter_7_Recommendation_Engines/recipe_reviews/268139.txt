Made this and brought it for Christmas Eve. It was a HUGE hit with comments such as "this would be perfect after a day of skiing or snowboarding", and "I cant wait to make this".  I didnt change a thing, and really really happy with it.

This was excellent.  Much better that what my father made years ago.

I made a half batch with Bacardi Black rum. This will become a party favorite!
