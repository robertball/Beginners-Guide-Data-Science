What a unique flavor! The mushrooms, but particularly the red pepper, lend distinct and different flavors that make this soup just a little unusual and very, very good. I took the easy way out and used a good, boxed chicken broth and some leftover rotisserie chicken. All I had to do was chop up the vegetables and throw them all in the broth along with the chicken pieces and soup pasta.  Let it all simmer away and 15 minutes later it was ready to serve.  I left out the carrots because I don't like them (and now that I'm a grown-up I don't have to eat them) but I would NOT recommend omitting the red pepper as that's what gives this soup its special flavor.  Nice.

This soup was great.  I've been trying to find a good chicken noodle veggie soup and this is it.  It is time consuming but worth it and make ALOT of soup.  One change I would make is I didn't like the tortellini in the soup.(Although my hubby liked it)  Too much noodle - I will leave this out next time and add more veggies or potatoes.

I have been making this soup for the last few years and it is a great soup for those cold days. I changed nothing about the receipe.  It makes a large pot but is wonderful. Takes a while to make but its worth it.

This is wonderful!  I was very excited to find this recipe because I wanted chicken soup with tons of vegetables in it.  This is the winner!  PS. I also added a can of green beans and a can of corn (both drained).  I'm just so excited to have this recipe.  :)

Great!  I made it with rice spirals, red peppers, celery, zucchini, pre-made broth and cooked chicken.  It turned out great!  Thanks!

It's a lot of work but well worth the effort because the soup has lots of flavor and just gets better day after day.

I needed to use up some vegetables before heading off on vacation so I loosely used this recipe as a guide.  In doing so I think I proved that you can sub just about any vegetables and still come up with a wonderful soup.  I didn’t want to make 40 servings, so I braised a chicken breast in chicken broth, cooled and shredded it.  I strained the broth and put it back in the pot.  I added celery, carrots, mushrooms and more broth and simmered that for about ten minutes.  I then added the shredded chicken, red and yellow bell peppers and chopped green onions and simmered for another five minutes.  I added a good amount of Cajun seasoning and some leftover, cooked bow tie pasta and heated through.  WOW!  It was a delicious soup!  I realize I didn’t make this recipe, and I’m sure it would be delicious as written.  But I did want to write this review to show others that substitutions can be made with equally good results. UPDATE 10/11/11 - I froze my leftovers and pulled one out for dinner last night.  I was in a rush and didn't have already cooked pasta to throw in like I did the last time, but I did have cooked rice, so I used that.  EXCELLENT again!

Excellent soup!  I also added a box of frozen spinach and two 15 ounce cans of diced tomatoes. The next time I make it, I'm going to use two red bell peppers instead of one.  Really, really good!

I had leftover rotisserie chicken from Costco, so I cut that up in dices and used it for this soup. All I had to do was heat up the low soduim chicken broth until it was boiling then add the local grown carrots, zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper and mushrooms. For the celery, I just used two small stalks with the leafy green tops and minced it up thinly and added it to the soup. I didn't have any onions but I added 1 piece of garlic clove. Once the vegetables started to cook up a bit, I added a generous handful of the uncooked egg noodles. I seasoned the soup with fresh ground hawaiian sea salt and black pepper. I let the soup simmer for about 20 minutes until the noodles and vegetables were cooked. I had some fresh basil so I chopped up a little and sprinkled it on top last for color and flavoring. A very hearty, fresh, and flavorful soup this is! The soup has a light mild chicken taste, which I like a lot. The carrots taste sweet and still has a slight give when I took a bite into it - nice! The zucchinis still retained a nice bright green color to it, thou it was thinly sliced. All the fresh vegetables and herb makes this a 5 star for me. A pretty and "healthy" soup. It was perfect since my family woke up sick today.  I also made, "Buttermilk Bread I, " from this website, to serve along with this soup. (That bread is tasty by the way). I really enjoyed this soup. It was easy to make and it hit the spot with everyone.

Very tasty soup recipe.    By choice I omitted the red bell pepper, basil and mushrooms.  I used 5 or 6 cans chix broth instead of the base and I cooked the chicken in the broth (I was on a time constraint).  I also added a couple handfuls of baby spinach chopped up.  I actually didn't even use noodles of any kind since it was so nice and thick  I couldn't say five stars since I adjusted the recipe
