This recipe was great.  I used frozen artichoke hearts and just chopped them up.  To save time, I sauted the veggies in some olive oil to get them going.  My husband even gobbled this up and if I had told him it was artichoke soup, he wouldn't have even touched it.  My teenagers and even my 3 & 5 year old ate this soup up!  Need to make a double batch next time!

OK, this is a fairly labor intensive recipe.  But let's face it, artichokes always take a bit of effort.   Even eating them plain.  But this recipe is delicious.  Served it to friends and they consumed every drop even though I had doubled the recipe..

Life it too short - I used canned artichoke hearts, using just the bottoms and Land O Lakes fat free 1/2 & 1/2 to cut down on the fat. Yummy

sooooo good. I didn't have vermouth so I used a dry white wine. I also used two cans of artichokes. I used canned veggie broth and made the soup pretty salty without addding any salt.Thanks for an AMAZING recipe. It is definitely a keeper.

Thanks.

This was a very nice soup... but of course I made my own little changes..partially because I wanted the changes...and partially because I made a mistake! I added a lot more cheese than it asks for and I put in a variety of cheeses. I accidentally put the cream in at the beginning, however I just kept the heat below a boil and there was never a problem. Also one change I did was that I used a jar of artichoke hearts. It cut down on prep time by a lot. The jar had some special flavoring so I didn't use any salt or pepper. Delicious recipe! ^_^ I will make it for the second time right after I finish this review!

This is delicious and it's fairly easy. Fresh artichokes always are a bit of extra work as far as I'm concerned, but the flavor extraction makes them worth it. I steamed 4 artichokes, discarded the leaves, cut up and added the bottoms and the steaming water, then I added a can of artichoke bottoms to make up for the missing pulp from the leaves. Nothing was lost I'm sure. Instead of celery I used 1/2 a celeraic bulb I happened to have on hand. This result was a flavorful, creamy soup just right for a chilly fall evening meal, along with some cheese tortellini and steamed broccoli in a butter-EVOO garlic sauce.

Delish! I omitted the cheese and used about 1/2 of the cream, to make it more healthy and it still was amazing. I also used frozen artichokes and they worked fine. I will totally make this again and so will many people who I shared the soup and recipe with.

Great recipe. Very clean tasting. The CSA gave me 4 artichokes and I couldn't imagine dipping all of them into a butter sauce. This recipe was a great solution. I made it vegetarian by substituting vegetable broth. I also used light coconut milk instead of the heavy cream.

This was good. More of a 3 1/2 star only because I have a memory of what I was looking for in this soup. I was unable to find frozen atichoke hearts anywhere around here so I used canned. I will probably keep searching for what I want but will keep this recipe too.

This soup has achieved a miracle. This simple soup was not only eaten, but aslo requested by my soup despising father. My entire life he has not touched even a single drop of soup. No amount of poking, prodding, begging, or inquiring ever changed that. Yet, he stomached a whole giant ladle of this soup. There are no higher compliments!

This was a fantastic recipe even though I didn't use fresh artichokes. I used a can of artichokes (in water) and so I had to add 2 extra cups of chicken broth and omitted the 2 c. of water. I used less cream too. I also added 4 shredded chicken breasts to make it more hearty for my husband. It tasted soooooo good. I would use it to supplement a main course or add chicken to use as the main course. I have already shared this recipe with 2 people and plan to use it for a neighborhood get-together soon. My son and husband and I all give it 5 Stars!
