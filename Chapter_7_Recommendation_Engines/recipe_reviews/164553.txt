This seemed like a very interesting combination. I like coconut flavors though, so I decided to try this our on our gas grill. It actually came out REALLY good! I couldn't find any unsweetened coconut in the store, so I just used the sweetened kind. And instead of using regular burger buns, I got the Hawaiian rolls. I think the Hawaiian rolls made it all come together quite nice. The coconut flavor isn't overbearing at all. Its good for people that like coconut. But apparently the coconut flavor is present enough for people that don't like coconut at all to hate these burgers. But if you're a fan of coconut like me, these burgers are a must-try.

Very different and good!  I used the regular sweetened coconut since I can never find unsweetened.  I thought that 1 cup of mayo for 4 burgers seemed like an awful lot, so I decreased the amount to 1/2 cup, and I also increased the amount of cream of coconut mixed with it for more flavor.  We loved the sweet crunchy coconut topping!  If you don't like coconut, you won't like this recipe, but if you do, go for it!

Just a few notes: Only use the egg if using a very lean cut of meat like ground sirloin. Also, I use the regular sweetened flaked coconut. Reduce the salt to your taste but don't use less than 1/2 tsp. I always use low sodium soy sauce. If you are looking for extra lime flavor, try adding lime zest.  I hope you enjoy the recipe! And my motto is, use my recipe as a base and make it your own:)

Made these for dinner Tuesday night. These were absolutely the best burgers I have ever eaten!  Loved them! Used sweetened coconut(couldn't find unsweetened). Added a little oatmeal to hold them together. Cooked them on the stove in a skillet instead of on the grill. Served on Hawaiian Sweet Rolls.  Next time will make double and freeze extras for another time.

OMG these were insanely delicious!!!  Thoughts:  I didn't use the egg - didn't see the reason for it. Left out the salt you don't need it w/ the soy sauce being present.  Drop the mayo to 1/2 cup MAX. I had 4 guys try these burgers tonight and got a soaring rate of approval, even from a guy who said he didn't really like coconut.  Other comments were given how flavourful they were.  This is a tried and true burger for me!

These burgers are AWESOME! I tried them at the media party for Allrecipes when "What's Cooking" launched and I must admit I didn't think I would like them at all....but I had one and instantly wanted another. They are amazing! I can't wait to make them myself. Cute webisode by the way. : ) I am excited for it to air!!!

I had a tropical themed party and this is one of the items I made. I was worried about the salt content because of the previous review but everybody really liked the burgers and nobody complained about them being too salty (although I did use low sodium soy sauce). I loved the crunchy coconut...yum! I even used som to top pineapple ice cream later!

yummy! i love the crunchy sweet and salty coconut topping. I used fat free mayo for the cilanto-coconut spread. I did use the egg but I don't think it was needed. Definitely try this!

Outstanding - all four people having them thought they were great!  Because of mayo comments, I used a little less then recipe and a little more creme of coconut and was very happy with result.

Different but good. I preferred more lime juice and I wasn't crazy about the mayo. I broiled the burgers and I found it to be really juicy and flavorful. I'll definitely make these again!

My fiance gave this a 4 star rating but I thought it deserved 2 1/2...way too much coconut topping.  The burger was moist but I thought all of the coconut (though I love the flavor) dried it out.  I thought the cilantro flavor was a bit too much and it needed more lime flavor to it (neither of us tasted it and I put the juice of 2 limes in it).

The recipe is good but I reduced the mayo down to 1/4 cup.  I enjoyed the burger even more by itself with no mayo or bun.  You could really taste the flavor then.  I think it would be great on a salad!

To Wicksy==of course just leave out the cilantro if you don't like it. My suggestion would be not to substitute anything else.

My husband and I found it much too salty. We made up a batch and just couldn't eat them after trying a few bites. I'd suggest seriously cutting down on the salt if someone was going to try it. My husband and I won't be doing this one again.

These were very tasty, but I would recommend toasting the coconut shreds before you put it in the burger.  They were a little chewy.

Although we LOVE coconut..we did NOT like this. My husband tried re-heating one later and it was even worse. Maybe I did something wrong??!!

I wanted to try this recipe because it was so different and had good reviews. I was a little hesitant but am glad I made them because they were so good. I left out the cilantro but used all other ingredients. I will definitely be making them again.
