Creamy and light.  I had printed this out over a year ago and finally made it yesterday.  I loved that it has heavy cream and half & half in it, this made it much creamier than most other flans.  It is very good but a bit too eggy.  I'll make this again but tweak it a bit.

This was a very good recipe. I don't keep orange liqueur or vanilla beans on hand, so I replaced those with vanilla and lemon extracts and it still turned out very tasty. I would not recommend baking only for 45 minutes. Even using ramekins, we had to bake the full 60 minutes for them to set. The top may seem "set" after 45 minutes but the base could still be fluid. The eggs make this flan not as heavy as some of the richer flan recipes, but subsequently, it's not as smooth, which is okay, the flavor is still good.
