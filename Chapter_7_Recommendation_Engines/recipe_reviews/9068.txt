We loved this!!!  I used regular stuffing instead of corn bread- turned out great.  Very typical of stuffing yet better- the wild rice adds flavor and it didn't turn out dry at all.

This is a good stuffing recipe.  I tweaked it a bit.  I made this exactly as is but since I was cooking it in a casserole dish in the oven at 350 degrees instead of in the turkey,I added an extra 1 - 2 cups of chix. broth to make it moist.  Baked for about45 min to 1 hour.  Was a big hit at Thanksgiving.  Thanks.

Last year I took a chance and made this stuffing tohave something new in addition to my traditional stuffing....Wow, everyone raved over it and now that I am planning Thanksgiving dinner for this year I have had several family members ask if I am going to make this wonderful stuffing again!  It is easy to make (I baked it) and it looks and  tastes like you have been working in the kitchen all day making it and it.

I highly recommend this stuffing if you want to try something new and delicious this year.

This recipes was excellent, and I didn't rate it 5 stars simply because of prep time. It took 60 minutes for the wild rice to cook. The taste is great, and its visually appealing. The rice gives a nice texture to the stuffing. Everyone loved it!

I doubled this and added a cup of matchstick carrots and three minced cloves of garlic in when I sauteed the vegetables. After I combined everything, I threw the whole lot in the crockpot on LOW. I'll update how it was once we have it for dinner. EDITED: It's different. We ate it, but didn't enjoy it as much as giblet stuffing.

This was great!  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was requested again at Christmas!  My family loved it.  I added more mushrooms but otherwise kept the recipe the same.

I decided to have Thanksgiving in July and made Amber’s Super Stuffing (along with Marinated Turkey Breast and Yummy Sweet Potato Casserole both from this site).  I was a little hesitant because I have always made my mother’s famous stuffing recipe but I wanted to try something different.  I was pleasantly surprised – this was good.  I did not have a turkey cavity (made breasts) so I dime store wrapped some heavy duty tinfoil and put the dressing inside.  I also added about 1 extra cup of chicken broth to the stuffing because it was a little dry for my taste.  I would give this recipe a 3 ½ star rating but since I can’t, I gave it 4 stars.

This recipe is great! I used it before and everyone loved it. simple ingredients but great taste. I make sure the mushrooms and celery are a little larger so people can pick them out if they want. Overall a great recipe to have year round.

I have to say, this was okay as a whole on the recipe side. The recipe is lacking baking directions. As most people will use common sense, there are beginning cooks to even expert cooks that can see the directions are lacking completely from start to finish. A beginner might pass the recipe up due to the fact of not knowing baking temp & time. I however cooked this recipe at 350 for about 20-25 minutes. The recipe should also state a rough amount of extra chicken broth if needed, which I needed around a cup and a half cup to add to the whole batch. I was afraid of over saturating the dish as well not getting it moist enough. I also bought the wrong wild rice mix, it just so happened to be a Brown Rice Melody mix from Trader's Joe, but used it as that's what I bought. But at the end of the recipe, my son really liked it despite it having mushrooms, while everyone else thought it was okay.

This recipe is one of the many reasons I look forward to Thanksgiving. This is a "keeper" as far as our family is concerned!
