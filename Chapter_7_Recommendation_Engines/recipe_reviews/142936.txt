This was an interesting twist on stuffed peppers.  I cheaped out and bought green peppers instead of red, which would probably have tasted better.  I also couldn't find asadero cheese, so I used  4-cheese fiesta blend shreds sprinkled on top.  I added the tomato sauce mixed with some of the enchilada sauce (as per suggested in the "cook's tips") to the top as well.  I also kicked up the spices quite a bit.  Good basis, but I think it could be better with a little more tweaking, like adding more sauce and cheese to the meat mixture.  I will definitely make it again.

Well I did not really like it. I mean the rice to meat ratio doesnt work. There should be less rice and more meat and it needs more spices..

Just needed something else. The peppers just seemed bland paired with the stuffing, which was very yummy. Maybe I will make it into a unstuffed pepper next time.

I thought these were so good, and so different than the usual stuffed green peppers! I did do a few things different. I used 5 peppers total, 3 yellow and 2 red. I used instant white rice!! I didn't do the pre-baking of the peppers, I blanced them in water(that's how we do our green peppers, so that's what I did) I didn't have a poblano pepper, so I used two serrano chiles and I just chopped them up and with seeds and all, and threw them in with the ground beef and onions. I couldn't find asadero cheese so I used quessadilla cheese. I didn't melt it I just placed some on top of each pepper. YUMMY! I think I might try the sauce that the footnote says to do next time. I would make this again.
