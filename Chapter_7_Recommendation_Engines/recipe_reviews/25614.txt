Now this is an excellent cake! This is the first cake on this site that I wish I could give more than 5 stars. My family loved it. The only change I made was I used a 9x13 pan and it worked fine. The cake is moist and flavorful and the glaze is awesome!!! I was just looking for a cake to use up some apples, and boy was I surprised when it turned out soooo good. I have made this cake about 6 times now and I have noticed that using cake flour makes it lighter and not as dense and different types of apples also make a difference. I also like to use about 1/2 C applesauce and 3/4 oil for a healthier version. When I prepare the glaze I bring it to a boil slowly and let it cook just a little maybe a minute then I poke a few holes in the warm cake before pouring the glaze over it.

I hate to make a recipe for a function without trying it first, but I didn't have time before the garden club meeting.  I made this recipe and it was a huge hit.  I made it in a bundt pan, baked for 1 hour and used less glaze than called for.  I removed the cake from the pan shortly after removing from oven and it worked great.  Took the left overs to work and had many requests for the recipe. Thanks

I was a little concerned when making this because the batter was so thick. However, I was pleasantly surprised when it came out. I cooked it in a bundt pan and it looked picture perfect. Everyone loved it and I particularly loved the added flavor and texture of the coconut. It was also more moist than the apple bread that I made the week before from another recipe on here. The glaze wasn't what I expected, but tasted sweet. My wife was expecting a glaze that was more white such as one made from confectioners sugar.

This was excellent! The amount of oil I poured in the bowl and then the amount of glaze and how that would work out had me a bit worried, but went forward as written with good faith and had a fabulous product.  I made exactly as is, no changes!!! I don't usually bring a new trial out in the open til I know it works, but did with this and it was a huge hit!

This is a wonderful cake.   Loved the coconut in it and the sauce is what really makes the cake.    Next time I will poke something into the cake to get the sauce to go to the bottom.    I made it exactly like the recipe says except I dusted the finished cake with powdered sugar.  LATER;  Today I made this cake again and used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil.  It is just perfect!   It's a great way to cut some fat and still get the great taste.

This is GREAT!!.  I didn't have fresh apples or orange juice so I used a quart of home canned apples and used the juice in place of the orange juice.  Really moist.

This was fantastic. I have made for several occasions, it is quick, easy w/ingredients on stock.  The only problem is there are never any leftovers :-)

This cake was ok, i dont see myself making it again anytime soon. The baking time is way too long, it was dried out and I even pulled it out ten minutes early.

This was a great recipe in which my husband gave a 10/10. I didn't make the frosting portion but served it as is and everyone loved it.

I did not like this at all. I am starting to think maybe I did something wrong, but I don't think so.  It is very dense and has a strange consistency.  Somehow I don't really like the taste either, but I don't know why because there is nothing out of the ordinary in it. Maybe it's the OJ? Can't put my finger on it, but not my taste.

This was really good, but I tweaked it so much that it wasn't really Apple Cake anymore :) I omitted the topping, and made my own sugary one.

Could not get this sucker out of the bundt pan. Tapped it on the granite counter easy many times then increased the to pounding and finally half fell out.  I had to spoon out the remaining and put it all into a 9 X 13 and poured the sauce over it.  Taste is five stars but I will never make it again.

Really good flavor even if a bit oily. Tastes less oily if you don't refrigerate. Will make again but will use a lot less oil next time.
