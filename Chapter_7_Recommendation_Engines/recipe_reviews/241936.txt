FABULOUS, after I dressed it up a bit! I fried the bacon in a Dutch oven, drained it on paper towels, fried the sausage in the same pan after draining some grease. I added the onion, carrot, and celery, (which I increased the amounts of to about 1c each,) threw in the garlic once the veggies were almost done. I deglazed the pan with water, chicken Better than Bullion, added about 2 Tbs sazonador, (found in the Mexican food aisle.) I then put the cabbage in, seasoned with more salt and pepper and a few more splashes of sazonador, threw the lid on for about 5 minutes to let it get tender, removed the lid to reduce the liquid and stirred til nearly done. THEN, (and this is good!!) I returned the bacon, topped the whole thing with two tubes of refrigerated biscuits, and baked it at 400 for 15-20 mins til they were a nice light brown. It was AMAZING!!! Oh!! And the apple!! I used a Granny Smith- diced 1/2 and cooked it with the veggies, thinly sliced the other 1/2 and added it with the cabbage!

Italian Cabbage Casserole Haiku: "Something not quite right. Bit too much coriander. Just wasn't so great." We couldn't nail down what it was about this casserole that didn't sit well w/ us. We love the combination of any type of sausage w/ cabbage, not to mention bacon too! The only small alterations that I had to make were less celery (didn't have 2 c. worth, which really seemed like way too much!), I used a bag of shredded cabbage/carrot "coleslaw mix", and Vidalia onion instead of white. 2 TB of Italian seasoning and the 2 tsp of coriander was over-kill. Simply the bacon, S&P and garlic would've made us enjoy this much more I think.

We loved it! I did not use the bacon at all and I did not add salt.  I only used 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning and 1 teaspoon of coriander.  I did not have celery so I used a 1/2 teaspoon of celery seed.  We will make this again!

Fantastic and easy. I didn't find the coriander over powering at all. My only complaint was it was a bit salty and I didn't add the recommended salt. Will use reduced beef broth next time. I also didn't cook the veggies that long, just added celery carrots and cabbage at the same time and cooked till crisp tender.

I give it 2 stars, my husband gives it 4. It was too much broth and too much Italian.

My family (kids and all!) loved this meal! I will definitely be making this again. I used a homemade spicy Italian sausage so I cut back on the herbs and spice and cut the salt completely. We try not to eat pork but, had the homemade sausage left in the freezer, Iâ€™ll be trying this with turkey sausage and bacon and let you know how it goes!

Triple the bacon  -  CUT OUT the apple and the coriander, and you have a nice dish.
