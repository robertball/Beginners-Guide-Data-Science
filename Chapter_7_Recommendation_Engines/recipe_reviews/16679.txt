This one is a keeper!  With 3 exceptions, we followed the recipe exactly.  There were only 2 of us and we aren't big eaters, as in our younger years.  We used just a tad over 1 pound of large shrimp, which made for left-overs.  We both l-o-v-e garlic and felt that 1 tbs minced garlic sorta equates to "why bother?".  I think I used about 6 good-sized cloves and minced 'em good.  Used all the rest of the ingredients and let it all rest in the fridge for at least 1 1/2 hrs, if not a bit more.  Bob didn't feel like messing with the grill, so we cooked 'em on the stove.  Served it over angel hair pasta along with some steamed spinach and a salad, and a lovely bottle of dry, crisp white French wine.

Oh my, what a meal!!  We both agree we may never order shrimp scampi in a restaurant again!  This recipe is sooo good on its own, 'though we just might try experimenting and add some white wine in the marinade next time.

The leftovers reheated beautifully in the microwave at half-power.

Thanks, Holly, this recipe is truly a keeper!

Too cold to be grilling outside, and no means of doing it inside, so I just cooked this in a skillet and served it over angel hair pasta seasoned with olive oil and garlic.  It was a big hit.

A now closed restaurant served something very like this.  My favorite!  I, like they, served it over  fettucine. I garnished with green onion tops and served crusty slices of bread on the side.  I cheated by cooking the shrimp in the sauce, stovetop. Yummy perfection and couldn't be easier! Edit: I added 2 T each of chicken broth and white wine.

This is really good stuff.  I made a few changes to suit the taste of my family.  To the butter sauce I added a bit of stock (chicken) and a little bit of lemon juice.  I let the sauce thicken up a bit and wow it was awesome.  Gonna make this one again.

This was a great easy way to cook shrimp for a cookout!  I found that if you left the shrimp in the scampi sauce for about a half hour it gave the shrimp more flavor.  Yum!!

My husband's reaction was WOW, I could eat these all night.  I made these as an appetizer for the Angel Hair Pasta with Shrimp & Basil (also from this site).  This shrimp scampi is so easy to make and I will make these again and again.

My brother made this recipe once and it was great. I tried it, and we both made it on the stove top, rather than over the grill as suggested. It left us with a great sauce in the pan, in which I cooked linguini and added to the recipe at the end. Awesome! Only thing was that I didn't have shallots on hand, so it wasn't as flavorful as the one my brother made, WITH the shallots. Wonderful recipe, nevertheless.  My husband loved it with pasta, and he doesn't usually like pasta.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Super fast and easy and you can even substitute green onions for the shallots. I gave this recipe to someone else who has thanked me kindly and has tried it herself twice!!

I LOVE the flavors of this recipe!!  I do believe it's my favorite way of having shrimp now............and that includes any restaurant shrimp I've had!  I followed the recipe precisely, except I cooked mine on my George Foreman Grill.  It was so easy and tasted wonderful!!  Absolutely incredible recipe!  Thanks!!!  :)

I used these for a shrimp dish where the shrimp was the main attraction, so I used big and meaty Jumbo Gulf Shrimp - beautiful.  I liked the mix of both butter and olive oil in this recipe, as well as the addition of chives and shallots, not usually seen in Shrimp Scampi recipes.  I didn't see the need for  paprika so I omitted it, but I did miss the lemon that IS typically part of any scampi recipe (or white wine) so I had Hubs give the shrimp a squeeze of fresh lemon juice as he broiled (rather than grilled) them. Four stars because of the absence of lemon in the recipe - five stars when included.

I altered the recipe to sautee instead of grill. I cooked the onions(shallots) first in the butter/oil/spices, then added shrimp when onions were soft - cook until shrimp is not clear (5 min) don't overcook. Serve on any pasta. Amazing!!!

Easy and delicious!  I followed other reviews by increase the garlic to 6 cloves and the shallots to 3 tablespoons. I also added 1/4 cup of wine to the mix.  I cooked the whole shrimp mixture on stove top and taking out the shrimps when it's almost done, leaving the sauce to thicken then stirred in some cooked penne, adding the shrimps back to the skillet when the penne is well mixed.  Then voila, dinner is ready!

It was okay. After cooking it and having a few, I took it away and added crumbled Feta Cheese. That livened up the shrimp.

Made thistonight with a few modifications.  I put everything in a ziplock bag for about 30 minutes and "squished" it around to distribute everything.  Added a bit more EVOO to pan and sauted all until shrimp were cooked thru.  Added a splash of white wine and a few red pepper flakes.  Served all over fettucinni.  Yummy...definitely a keeper and oh so easy.

Would rate higher than 5 stars if I could...this is a great recipe. Made it for a party yesterday and 2 pounds of shrimp went FAST!!!!!! The only change I made was doubled the garlic and I cooked it in a pan on the stove. It was PERFECT....YUM!!!!   Thanks for the recipe, cant wait to make this again!

If you're looking for THE BEST and yet simple recipe....you've found it.I've made it for family, friends and parties and everyone is amazed that it's truely shrimp scampi but with the smokey flavor of the grill. They also like the idea that It's not swimming in a pool of oil but still has the intense flavor plus more because it's grilled. For those of us that do EVERYTHING on the grill ALL times of the year (yes, I'm guilty)...now you can grill your scampi and eat it too! haha I have made this exact recipe for years now. I recently lost the recipe and although I could make them pretty much the same from memory, it's nice to have the exact recipe on hand whenever I need a "reboot". I about cried yesterday when I thought it was gone. THANK YOU SOOOO much for keeping this one up!....I have my recipe back!!!!

This was delicious! I made it for my hunni for valentine's day and he loved it! I did some minor tweaking. I added a 1/4 stick of butter, 4 cloves of garlic (minced) and a package of steamed broccoli to the noodles. Perfect! i will definitely be making this again!

We are garlic fans, but this one had almost no flavor except for the garlic.  I wouldn't make it again.

Very good recipe.  Used 6 cloves of garlic. Also chopped up a small tomato that I had hanging around and threw it in when the shrimp was almost done. Will definately make again. Thanks.

Excellent restaurant quality recipe!  The only changes I made was to add 6 cloves of garlic. I marinated the shrimp in the sauce for a few hours, then sauted the whole works in a wok.  I served it over angel hair pasta and there were no leftovers! Also, if shallots are not readily available, I think using another mild onion would work as well.

Delish but it doesn't have enough "sauce" so it's hard to evenly mix with pasta.

EXCELLENT!  Hubs wanted surf and turf last night so I made these to go with our little filets.  Grilled the steaks, and while they were resting, threw these on.  The grill gave these terrific flavor.  I had reserved some of the marinade separately from the shrimp.  I warmed it in the microwave to barely heat it.  Then drizzled it over both the shrimp and steak when plating.  YUM!

Easy and very tasty.  I marinated mine and then grilled them on skewers.  Absolutely amazing!  Be sure not to overcook the shrimp.  You want to pull them off before they curl completely.

What a fabulous recipe!!  All I had were frozen cooked jumbo shrimp, so I had my doubts at how this would turn out.  I mixed the marinade adding about 1/4 cup of white wine, and marinated the shrimp for about 2 hours.  Then, I heated a skillet on med. high heat, threw in the whole shebang, and served french bread to mop up the juices.  Very impressive results, thanks for the recipe!!

WOW.  I let the shrimp marinate for a few hours in the sauce and then skewered them for easier grilling.  Incredible.  Thanks for the recipe!

I sauteed this dish using slipper lobster, that I bought at the farmer's market, instead of shrimp.  Also, I only used garlic (no shallots or chives on hand).  I used smoked paprika and really liked the flavor that imparted. The flavor, overall, was very good, but I think grilling would be even better! I ate it with pita bread, dipped into some of the garlic, paprika oil - yum!

We really loved this recipe. We did not grill ours. We put it into an electric frying pan and fried the shrimp in some oil. When we cooked it this way, we had a sauce that we served with the shrimp. It was excellent! We added extra garlic - 1 tablespoon was not enough for us.

I made this and the whole family really liked it.  I had to broil it as it was way too cold out to BBQ, and it turned out just fine.  I made this for dinner instead of as an appetizer and served with rice and a veggie.  I will make this again.  Thanks.

I was looking for a good base for my angel hair pasta and this was it, actually this is a GREAT base.  I was looking to duplicate a dish I had dinning out and now I have.  I added sun-dried tomatoes for personal taste.  I mixed the angel hair pasta with the butter/oil sauce and my family loved it.  This was so simple.  I had dinner ready under 20 minutes.  Thanks Holly.  This one is definetly a keeper.

I loved all the ingredients in the sauce, but the flavor didn't really penetrate into the shrimp. Next time I'll take others' advice and either marinate it longer or saute it in a pan and serve it along with the sauce over angel hair pasta. I can't wait to try it again with a few modifications. We served our leftovers over a nice Greek salad - good combination.

This is good but I think next time I would double the garlic and shallots and use regular butter.  I also added a dash of red pepper flakes and it gave it that extra special kick.  
Thanks for posting!

Wonderful shrimp on the grill. We have made this for friends as a dinner appetizer several times. To help keep the shrimp on the BBQ we place them on a grill grate with holes. Just make sure you don't get the grill too hot before adding the shrimp. The butter can easily flame up, which turns the shrimp black. Watch your heat and these guys are outstanding.

This was really good. When I went to make this I realized I didn't have butter, so I had to use margarine instead. I didn't use chives either and only 1 pound of shrimp. Cooked in fry pan as some other reviews suggested. Even with these changes, it still is one of the best garlic shrimp I've tried. Thanks Holly!

Sounds a lot like Shrimp Scampi which was so popular during the '5o's. For those who need a shortcut in time and effort, use a good quality Italian salad dressing(adding extra garlic is recommended)and marinate at least 1/2 hr then place under broiler for about 2 mins each side. During last 2 mins brush with extra marinade. if using fresh shrimp broil on both sides til dark pink.Bon appetite!

All I can say is YUM.  I am only giving it 4 stars because somehow the shrimp or perhaps the oil made our grill flare up almost catching our patio on fire. That would have hindered our Valentines Day.

Excellent - I read other reviews and let it marinate longer...overnight to be exact.  I was very nervous because just the smell of the garlic (which I put more in) was so overwhelming I thought it would overwhelm.  It didn't - we cooked them on the grill on skewers and they were great.

This is an excellent recipe! I used Key West Pink shrimp, thawed. Didn't have chives, substituted parsley with great results. I melted the butter with the other ingredients, poured it over the shrimp, & chilled it about 2 hrs. Saute'd and served in deep bowls with crusty bread. Divine! I agree that more is better with the garlic & shallots- also added a healthy dash of red pepper for kick-

What a great recipe.  I used it like a marinate though... I combined everything except the butter and marinated the shrimp for several hours, then I spritzed the shrimp with spray butter before grilling.. it was wonderful.

A cook I am not, but this recipe was SO EASY and delicious! I followed the recipe except for the grilling part. I liked the idea of cooking it on the stove top to get a nice sauce and then added linguine noodles. Oh yes, and 2 cloves of garlic! YUMMY!

I was looking for a quick dinner with the shrimp I had on hand. This turned out wonderfully. Unfortunately, it was the one time I did not have shallots (which we love!) on hand, so following a suggestion I used onion. I also added a hint of red pepper. I can't wait to try this with shallots! I may try adding a little white wine too. Probably making this again for New Year's Eve dinner tomorrow night!

Great, although I served this as an "tapas" appetizer, since I was looking for the spanish "gambas al ajillo". I marinated the shrimp with about 4 TB of good butter and the oil.  Then I heated another 1/3 cup olive oil to very hot and dumped in the shrimp.  After about 2 minutes, I mixed the shrimp up, added salt, fresh ground pepper, and about 1 tsp. cajun seasoning ( Slap Yo Momma).  I served it with french bread. Of course, the shrimp was very fresh, bought off the boat near Apalachacola Florida.    I think next time I'll reduce the oil, add some chopped green onions at the last minute and thicken with some cream and maybe flour.  I'll serve in a toasted bread bowl and bet it's just like a very popular recipe at an Italian restaurant in Baltimore!!

Really nice!  I put the shrimp on skewers and tossed them on the BBQ.  Then I did the sauce on the stove and poured it over the shrimp on a bed of rice.  Next time I would maybe cut back on the oil and butter and add some cream to make it...well, a cream sauce!

I loved the marinade...but it does need to marinate for some time...we couldn't taste it on the shrimp.  Also...the butter made the grill fire up a LOT and it caused a lot of the marinade to come off and the shrimp tasted like...well, fire and grill!  I will make extra sauce next time like others recommended and try tossing with pasta as well as letting the shrimp marinate for a while...yummy!  How do we keep the fire from flaming so much???

This was a great light alternative to dinner.  However I recommend making some extra marinade and heating it over the stovetop and serving it drenched over the shrimp.

Extremely good!.   My only regret was that we didn't have any fresh shrimp around, and the frozen ones weren't peeled and deveined. Since I was short on time, I got cooked shrimp.  This caused the shrimp themselves to be very plain, but the sause was heavenly...  Next time I'll make sure to get the fresh shrimp.

A gastronomic delight Holly! This recipe pays such big dividends in compliments for such a simple recipe! I love it! I prepared it on the stove top, put frilly-topped toothpicks thru the prawns, then provided a sweet and sour apricot dipping sauce for my guests. I cooked up a batch 
in which I put salted butter and 1t curry. They seemed to enjoy that one as well.Thanks so much.

This recipe is outstanding.  I didn't have chives so I used parsley as a substitute.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I've been trying out a bunch of shrimp recipes from this site recently, and this is by far my favourite! Served over rice, it was perfect for lunch!

Nice flavor, but too much butter for my taste.  Next time, I'll cut the butter by half.

Superb.  I find the best way to devine/butterfly the shrimp is by making a horizontal cut (all the way through) 3/4 ths of the way down.  Then simply laying them flat on the broiler on each side.  In addition I like to top the finished shrimp with the left over butter/sauce from the broiler.

Fantastic and easy recipe! I added a little extra in the sauce - cayenne pepper, garlic salt (for some added spiciness) and a little bit of flour to thicken it up, but wow, what a great sauce and so easy to make - Thanks

Probably the best shrimp scampi I have ever tasted!  Way better than the local chain restaurants.  I will make this again and again! I served the shrimp scampi with corn on the cob, salad, and a baked potato.  Even my daughters gobbled it up!

YUM-YUMMMMMM!!!!. This was the best scampi I ever made. My husband said it was better then a seafood resturant. I did make it in a saucepan instead of the broiler and served it over thin spaghetti.Our guests loved it also. I will be making this again and again. Thank You so much for sharing this recipe.

These were very quick and easy.  I added two tablespoons of garlic and shallots as well I used salted butter.  I also coated the shrimp in flour and let them sit in the fridge for half an hour before cooking them in my electric skillet.  Thanks for sharing.

I had to substitute chopped onion for shallots and green onion for chives due to availability in Japan, but this dish was definitely a keeper.  I scaled it down for two but it wasn't quite enough, so be generous.

Only changes I made were to add more garlic and cooked on the stovetop. After I put all ingredients in a ziplock bag and mushed it around to "marinade", I could not see how this would cook well on the grill. Mine had some chunks of butter here and there and I just thought it would melt off and burn. Also, I would not have any sauce if I grilled it. But it did have great taste so I'm giving it five stars.

Excellent flavor and easy to prepare. I used half basil olive oil. Let shrimp marinate in sauce a couple hours. Cooked in skillet on the stove as my large shrimp were too small to skewer and grill. Much faster too.  I did use as an appetizer but I can see using the cooked sauce tossed with spaghetti and the shrimp on top. Added a sprinkle of chopped fresh basil.

Made this as part of a three course meal; salad, shrimp and soup.  The old three "S" meal!  Other than cooking inside in a cast iron skillet I didn't change a thing.  By accident so to speak I left them sitting in the butter mixture for about a half hour and that certainly didn't do anything to hurt the taste.  While maybe not a star on it's own it was a really nice compliment to a mini feast.  A keeper!

Not bad, but I'd rather eat it with scampi. Fettuccini is not a good combination with this.

When I eat out (which is a rare occurrence) I order Shrimp Scampi appetizer for my meal.  Rarely disappointed but found this recipe is easy, quick and sooo good!  Just as good as "theirs ".  Way to go!   I do serve over 1/2 cup of rice.  That is my ONLY change.
