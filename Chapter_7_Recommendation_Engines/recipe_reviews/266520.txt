Easy and delicious! Followed the recipe exactly to measurements. Pesto was delish. Will make it again. Will also freeze some .

So easy and so very good.  I used two cloves of garlic because I like a little milder flavor and it worked out perfectly for us.

I did not make any changes to this recipe. It is fresh, and very clean tasting. I plan to use it in homemade tomato soup.
