Another tip: if you want to cut the apple and pear ahead of time, just toss it w/ a little of the dressing to prevent browning. Keep it in a separate container and add at the last minute.

Made it for my office holiday party. It was a hit! Got lots of raves and a few people asked for the recipe. My modifications: (a) I doubled the recipe but instead of using 2 heads of romaine lettuce I used one head of romaine and 1 bag of spinach. (b)Omitted the Swiss cheese. (c) Instead of cashews I added toasted pecans (toasted myself). Nuts such as pecans and walnuts seem to match the fruit and season better. (d) I added some dried cherries along with the dried cranberries. (d)Despite having doubled the salad I only needed half as much dressing because the dressing was on the side.

Having the dressing on the side worked great. I used less, the salad didn't get soggy and the leftovers kept better. The leftovers were actually minimal. I made a huge bowl. Since the original recipes makes 12 - 1 cup servings, I made roughly 24 cups. At the end of the evening the rest fit tightly in a 3-cup Ziplock plastic storage container.

FANTASTIC!  The lemon poppyseed dressing is absolutely delicious.  Be sure to use freshly squeezed lemons and not the stuff out of the yellow plastic containers - - it does make a difference. I used butter lettuce instead of romaine, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  The pears, apples, cheese, and cashews combined perfectly with the lemon dressing.  One word of caution - - this fed three hungry adults (two helpings for the men).  So don't be fooled by the "serves 12".  Your family and guests will go back for seconds, trust me!

4 stars as is; 5 stars with changes.  The dressing is wonderful.  I don't think bland crunchy romaine is a good choice for white, peeled, crunchy fruit.  I would go with spring greens, baby spinach, etc as a contrast to the fruit.  I would also leave the fruit unpeeled to add color to the salad.  I used pecans as that was what I had and thought they worked fine.  A very, very good sald with another choice of greens.

I have been making this for Christmas the last couple of years and everyone loves it!  I make the dressing the day before and wash the lettuce and leave it overnight in the spinner.  I soak the apples in sprite so they won't brown.  A nice compliment to a turkey and ham dinner.  Very light and refreshing.

Made this for Christmas dinner and loads of times since.  Its been a big hit.
I use a red onion which turns the dressing pink - its very pretty and I usually server it on the side.  Also I add all the ingredients into the processor together and I still get the same results (I didn't read the recipe right the first time !).
After the first time, I omit the chesse as I don't think it adds anything to the overall result.
As others have said there is way too much dressing for one salad but I always manage to use up the leftovers.

This salad is outstanding!! I chose to omit the cashews and replaced them
with slivered almonds instead.  If I make this for lunch I include the swiss cheese
but if I'm making it to serve to company with a meal I omit the cheese.  This
recipe is a keeper and people I've made it for absolutely went wild over it!!!

Easily one of my favorite salads. My modifications: 1) I minced the onion very fine since I don't have a food processor. 2) I also used walnuts instead of cashews and it goes so well with cranberries. 3) I cube the apples in advance and dump them into a container with the dressing, This way when I'm preparing lunch for work in the morning I just scoop out the apples onto a bed of lettuce, toss in some nuts and berries, and I have a fantastic salad!

Wonderful salad.  Dressing reminded me of fresh squeezed lemonade with a twist.  HELPFUL HINT:  Use FRESH squeezed lemons, it's worth the extra work and pulls the ingredients together much better than the lemon concentrate!  Didn't have romaine, so I used a spring green/spinach mixture.  Was somewhat skeptical of the Swiss cheese, but it blended beautifully.  Didn't have cashews, so I subbed roasted walnuts which added a depth of flavor and earthiness to the salad.  I served this at a dinner party for eight, left the skin on the fruit and fanned the apple and pear on top of the individual plates and then sprinkled the walnuts and (added) blueberries over the top.  Lovely presentation.  Thank you Nora!  Love your recipe.

Wow - what a fabulous, yet elegant salad to serve at a holiday get togther or anytime for that matter! It's got a wonderful combination of flavors, colors and textures. The dressing is absolutely delicious and the proportions are spot-on, if I had to change anything I would use just a little less sugar.  But other than that is was perfect. I just threw everything into a mini-food processor and gave it a whirl then poured it into a container and added the poppy seeds last and just shook it up.  I used butter lettuce vs. romaine and toasted walnuts vs. cashews.  I soaked my apples and pears in lemon water so they wouldn't brown.  The Swiss cheese was very good and next time I might try a blue cheese or even a feta. Great recipe that's very easy and something you'll want to make again!

Everyone went crazy for this.  It was a new addition to our New Year's Day meal, but we will certainly make it again soon.  We added a little bit extra sugar to the dressing and subbed pecans for cashews.  Delicious!

Wowzer! This salad is straight into my top favourites on here. I made this salad on Christmas eve and everyone kept saying how delicious it was. I did make one small change. I didn't have cashew nuts so I used pecans instead and I toasted them in a dry frying pan before adding to the salad. If the salad is going to last more than one day, I would recommend not only adding the dressing individually once on peoples' plates but also slicing and adding the pear individually as the pear slices can get a little mushy if added to the main body of the salad itself and kept until the next day.

I have made this numerous times and this always gets RAVE reviews.  You can definately vary the lettuce and fruits.  Big tip is I use splenda as a sub for the sugar and you can not tell one bit.

OMG!  I like salads, but WOW!  This was a breeze to make (especially when I used the prepackaged romaine), and the dressing was fabulous!  I suggest you make the dressing the night before and let it spend an evening in the fridge to mellow and for the flavors to mix more.  I will make this as often as I can!

This was fantastic! 
I used what I had on hand, since most of it was already in the house, and what wasn't was easily substituted...so spring greens rather than romaine, chopped pecans rather than cashews, and goat cheense crumbles rather than the swiss. 
I think the texture and flavor of the goat cheese probably compimented this better than the swiss would, anyway, especially reading some of the other reviews.
I didn't measure the dressing ingredients too carefully either...just did it by taste since I was only making enough for the 2 of us, but I think I probably used a bit less sugar, and a bit more mustard and onion, proportionally.  I can't wait to make it for company!

As big salad eaters, this is a really nice change of pace. The apple and pear kind of worried me, but they work! Used toasted almond slivers and left out the cheese. The first time I used mandarin oranges and did not care for the juiciness. Added thinly sliced red onion. Cut sugar in half. Dressing tastes very oily but works well in the salad. Will definitely be added to our salad rotation!

This salad is sooo good! My kids ate it right up and they aren't big on salad usually.  I left out the onion and used a a couple tablespoons LESS sugar, and only 1/3 cup of oil.  Also have used toasted pecans or almonds instead of the cashews, and didn't use any cheese.  One of the best salad recipes I've had; definitely will be making often!

I made this salad for a Christmas party and it was the hit of the evening.  Everyone loved it, even the self-proclaimed "salad haters."  I followed the recipe for the dressing exactly, but I found that I did not need to use it all.  I used about 2/3 of it, and I think more would have been overkill.  For the salad itself, I took the suggestions of other reviewers and did not peel either the apple or the pear.  I tossed them in a bit of the dressing, and they did not discolor at all.  For presentation, I used a large shallow bowl, layered the romaine, cranberries, cheese, and nuts, then arranged the diced apple and pear around the edges.  It looked spectacular, and then I tossed it all together at the table.  There was one tiny bit of lettuce left in the bowl at the end of the evening.  I will definitely make this recipe again and again.  It looks hard, but it is really pretty easy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is my favorite salad to serve all year round. The biggest change I make is baking chicken with the lemon poppyseed dressing. Chicken, fruit, salad, and nuts- what a dish!

Made it exactly as written and it's a great salad. Add the cut up fruit to the dressing and add it to the salad just before serving. This way your fruit wont discolor and your greens will stay crisper---and this makes it easier to transport to a potluck.

My children and husband said it was the best salad they had ever had!!  I followed some of the reviews and substituted toasted pecans for the cashews and dried cherries instead of cranberries. I also feel the Swiss cheese did not add anything but calories. The dressing is divine!  I'm addicted!!

Delicious! I made it just as it's written, and it was great! I also like salads with other types of cheeses and nuts, but the swiss and cashews make fantastic flavor combinations in this salad and in your mouth! Next time I will decrease the amount of sugar I use - it was a little too sweet for me, but still soooo delicious. Yumm!!!

Lovely salad, worthy of serving to guests.  Mixed a little bit of "greens" in with the romaine to give a more festive appearance.  Subbed olive oil, blue cheese since that's what I had on hand.  Agreed with other reviewers that the sugar could be cut to about 1/4 cup.

was a hit with my family and my guests.

I made this salad and dressing exactly as written, and it was a hit at the party I took it to. However, the great thing about this recipe is its tweak-ability ( yes it is a word- look it up!!) Reading a lot of reviews has given me so many ideas for the next time. Thanks for a keeper!

I love this salad! My mom has been making this for a few years and it's just the perfect paring with a nice autumn dinner. It's easy to make, and has a wonderful sweetness to the dressing, along with the accompinment of the sweet fruits.  I am actually pairing it tonight with a pumpkin ravioli w/ gorgonzola cheese sauce.

This was a beautiful salad for our Christmas gathering.  I added the fruit and dressing just before serving.  If I make it again I will put the dressing on earlier because the leftover salad was more flavorful.

Very good salad.  I served this with our Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it.  The dressing is wonderful.  I used a combination of Romaine lettuce and baby spinach, and changed the nuts to walnuts.  I know I'll make the dressing a lot.  It would be good on any salad mixture.

Made this last night for a holiday dinner party, and it was excellent! I doubled the recipe for a party of 8, and we had about two cups leftover. Our guests unanimously raved about this, and all wanted the recipe. I used Honey Crisp apples and Bosc pears. Subbed walnut pieces for the cashews and used about half of the listed amount of shredded Swiss. Also, per the suggestion of another reviewer, I used red onion to give the dressing a little pink color. I cut up the pears and apples in advance and tossed them in a several TBS of dressing, and I later tossed this with the rest of the ingredients with one more TBS of dressing, and that was more than enough. I had tons of dressing leftover, as many other people have noted, so unless you like having it leftover, you can cut those amounts in half and still have plenty. Great recipe - this salad will be made very regularly. Thanks!

This is a wonderful salad!  The lemon poppyseed dressing is fabulous.  I served this salad with stuffed lobster and the dressing complimented the meal splendidly.  Definitely will have this again and again!

I have made this salad numerous times over the years and it's great!  As with some of the other reviewers, I back off on the sugar a bit and it's still great.  I too prefer to leave the skin on the fruit for color.  I also make this in summer and substitute red grapes for dried cranberries.

Delicious vinaigrette and salad.  I had almonds and fontina on hand instead of swiss and cashews.  I skipped the poppy seeds and added half a tablespoon of celery seed.  Next time, I want to reduce the amount of sugar by half to see if it makes a big difference.  With the leftover dressing I plan to marinate some chicken thighs.

After tweeking a bit, I loved this. Original was too sweet for me. Thus only 4 stars. I wish it was possible to give 4 1/2 though.

Glad I read the other reviews first. I doubled the dressing recipe, using only 1/2 cup of sugar and it was perfect. Vegetable oil is not something I use, so I substituted 1/3 cup olive oil and 1/3 cup canola oil. I used the leftover dressing on plain spinach and lettuce the next day and it was great. The cheese and nuts are nice in a salad but I do not like swiss or cashews. I used sliced almonds and blue cheese. The cranberries and fruit were nice. This recipe will be added to my favorites.

This was so DELICIOUS!!! My husband laughed and said I was making too much salad, but between the two of us and my two teenagers, my huge salad didn't stand a chance. Served with pan seared swordfish and garlic bread, and it was perfect. This may actually be on the Thanksgiving table this year. Thank you for sharing!

I have served this for dinner and over the holidays for years now and everyone raves over it.  I sometimes substitute sliced havarti cheese that I have cut in strips, it goes great with the fruit.  I love this and it's easy!  It's always gone at the end of the meal.

LOVED IT!!! Made this for Thanksgiving and it was so good. Everyone loved it. My only suggestion is to serve the dressing separate so it does not make the salad soggy if it sits out for a little bit.

This is delicious! I read other reviews that suggested cutting the sugar to 1/4 c. from 1/2 c.- I did and it was terrific still. I used  Fugi Apple and a Bartlett Pear- Oh, and I used fresh grated Parmesan instead of Swiss, just because I didn't have any Swiss.

This salad was wonderful!  It was elegant and worthy of a nice occasion.  The only change I made was to substitute almonds for the cashews (due to an allergy) and it was still every bit as good.  Thank you for sharing- I will definitely be making this again.

I have eaten this salad every day for the last 4 days, I absolutely love it.  I substituted pecans for the cashews and add cut up chicken for a main dish meal.  I used 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar  and the dressing  was just perfect. I used feta cheese which I prefer. I bought more pears today so I can make more salad. If I had just read the recipe I don't know if I'd have made the salad but the reviews convinced me to try it, I'm so glad I did.  This is a keeper for sure.

Another great recipe from this site. My husband and I loved the dressing which I served on the side. I used shreds of parmesean cheese as I do not care for Swiss. This is as good as Jamies Spinach Strawberry Salad. Will try a spring mix blend of lettuces next time.

Made this for a holiday dinner party - a festive and delicious addition to the table. I added some slices of fuyu persimmons and kiwi - the colors of both were really pretty and they tasted great along with the other parts of the salad (and they are winter fruits).  Used toasted pecans rather than cashews and did not use the cheese (too much for this dinner).  Tossed the greens with about a third of the dressing, plated that, and then put a scoop of fruit and a few nuts on top of each plate - easy, attractive and everyone loved it!

Excellent! I used Havarti because I don't like Swiss, but I think any mild hard cheese would work in this recipe. The Lemon Poppyseed dressing is now a favourite, and I often make it for regular salads as well.

I have been making this same salad for years with my own poppy seed dressing (vinegar instead of lemon juice and dry mustard instead of Dijon) and love it!  Sometimes I just make up the fruit minus the romaine for a yummy fruit salad.

This was a great recipe, but I did make a few changes and OMGosh was it good!  Just left out the mustard (mostly because I didn't have any and stores were already closed for xmas..lol) changed the veg. oil to olive and changed the nuts to toasted walnuts. wow was it ever good.  Very light and took the prime rib and ultimate twice baked potatoes and croissants to the next level.  This will definitely be a keeper, even with the small changes.

My kids didn't like it. My husband wouldn't even try it. I thought the taste of the dressing was too much for this and would've liked a sweeter sauce.

Awesome! Great flavor profile. Only change I made was we used spinach instead of romaine. Everyone at Christmas loved it.

Perfect, as is! I used bagged romaine lettuce mix instead of buying. I used two and doubled the batch and it was great, but had leftover dressing. I won't complain, though... I could use it later on another salad!

My son made this salad for our family on Christmas Eve this year. This was one of the best salads that I have ever eaten. The recipe was shared with quite a few of us that night. I am adding this salad to my favorites.

A great salad!  I served this as a first course for Christmas dinner.  It was a great way to start the meal.  I didn't have any pears so I used two apples instead.

Loved the dressing on this salad! I served it as a side for Christmas, and doubled the recipe as I had 20 people - that was NOT necessary. With all the other food, I easily have half left over.

This is a delicious salad. I didn't have any swiss, so I used feta instead which was good, but I'll bet the swiss would have been better. I also replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil. I will be making this one again.

This was absolutely wonderful! I usually don't change recipes before rating but I did decrease the sugar to 1/4 cup on this. I also used slivered almonds and feta cheese because that is what I had on hand. Everyone raved about this salad, even my hisband who is very picky about salad dressings. I am sure  that I will make this many times in the future!

I love this salad! It is different from an everyday vegetable salad, easy to make and impresses the teenager in the house. I like it with scallions for a boost of dark green color. It's just as delicious if you peel the fruit, but I like the look of the peel in the salad.

So yummy! I can't really rate the recipe as written, as I made a couple changes according to preference, but I would highly recommend this recipe. The only changes I made were to substitute pecans for the cashews and blue cheese for the swiss. It was delicious. I took it to Christmas Eve dinner and between 5 adults and 1 9 year old, we cleaned it up. I had everything ready to assemble when we arrived (I used another reviewer's suggestion and coated the chopped fruit with just a little dressing to prevent browning). Also, I only ended up putting half the dressing on and had the other half on the side if more was wanted. I think it would have been too much if the full amount was on the salad. Bottom line, a very easy and pleasing salad. On par with those I've had in nicer restaurants. Thank you for sharing!

I had this at a party last weekend and for some reason, it really hit all the right notes with me, so I made it at home last night.  It's a really great combination; my only quibbles are that the swiss cheese seems a bit pointless, since the mild flavor of swiss gets lost under the tangy dressing, and that the dressing might be a bit too sweet.  I think next time I might cut the sugar down a bit, as some other reviewers have suggested, and either skip the cheese or use something with a slightly stronger taste, like sharp cheddar.

This is a beautiful salad for the Christmas dinner table.  The lemon dressing tastes perfect- flavorful, light, and complementary.  I substituted toasted pine nuts for the cashews and added some chopped celery.  Extra dressing keeps well in a covered container in the refrigerator.

3 "Noms"...as in, Nom Nom Nom. Yum. Made this to go with my ham for Christmas dinner and the flavors were amazing together. I might try a different nut next time, just for curiosity sake, but the cashews were good! I will totally be making this again and again.

The salad is wonderful!  The dressing is FABULOUS!  I use splenda or half splenda instead of all sugar and it is fine.  It's got that lemon pucker but perfect sweetness and my family and friends love it.  Also, I use this on romaine,red onions, red pepper, strawberries, pecans and feta cheese.  It is to die for and crave it everyday.

I've made this several times, and have loved it each time.  Any time I take it somewhere, people ask for the recipe.  I make it just the way it is outlined, except I usually add more cashews and dried cranberris, becasue they are so good.

I really liked the texture of this salad--a nice mix of crunchy and chewy, and the romaine is a perfect choice. I used raw, aged-cheddar goat cheese, and halfway through I added blue cheese, which really brought out the flavor of the apples. I might try a different nut--the cashews added great texture but not much flavor. I thought the dressing was good, not great; but it's right for this recipe. I subbed agave for sugar.

Have said it before, as has everyone else!  Try this salad!!  Make is "as is" the first time, but serve dressing on the side.  Then tweak it as you like.  Very versatile.  Great with Splenda or sugar.  I have made with several different nuts and cheeses, as well as dried mixed fruits, cherries, etc.  Never disappointing.  Catered my office Christmas party and this was the salad.  I had none left!!  Don't be afraid of the combo...just close your eyes and step into heaven.....

I took this salad to a family gathering and it was a HIT!  Everyone loved it.  I made some alterations.  I used 2 bags of 50/50 romaine and spinach and added mandarin oranges as suggested.  The recipe does make up too much dressing so mix it in according to your estimation.

It was wonderful!!!  I used baby spinach mixed with romaine lettuce, because I love spinach with the sweeter dressings, and pomegranates instead of dried cranberries to make it extra fancy for Christmas, and it was great.  I added more apples and pear, and sugared almonds instead of cashews.  One of the best salads I have ever tried.  Thanks!

This recipe is awesome - there's hardly any way you can mess it up!  I used walnuts instead of pecans and forgot the poppy seeds the first time, it was still great.

Wonderful recipe.  It's my husband's all time favorite salad.  I've made it several times and everyone seems to love it.  I do add extra romaine lettuce since the dressing tends to go far. I keep everything else the same.  This is a keeper!!

Wonderful recipe.  It's my husband's all time favorite salad.  I've made it several times and everyone seems to love it.  I do add extra romaine lettuce since the dressing tends to go far. I keep everything else the same.  This is a keeper!!

This has become one of our holiday standards. It's a great addition to the usually heavy Thanksgiving or Christmas dinners, and the flavours are wonderful. I've experimented with a bunch of mild cheeses, and find that Havarti is my favourite in this recipe.

This salad is the BEST I have had in a very long time.  Easy to make and ALWAYS gets great comments at parties.  Make sure that your lettuce is WELL drained before making would be my only comment.  Try this and you'll be pleasantly pleased.

Made this salad for family Christmas Eve dinner everyone loved it.  It's very colorful and the homemade dressing makes this salad great.  Be sure to peel apple and pear at the last minute due to browning.  I will make this salad again!

This recipe was awesome! My husband and I throughly enjoyed the mixture of greens, fruits, and nuts. The dressing recipe stands on its own as well. We had leftover dressing and poured it over a fruit cup a few days later. I am thinking about making a batch for a gift to be presented in a pretty dressing bottle for a salad loving friend of mine. I used canola oil as it is a neutral fat for people with higher cholestral.

Somehow Swiss cheese in such a salad skipped my imagination. Thanks for the great idea! ****QUICK TIP*****: if you have a hand blender (stick version), place all dressing ingredients in a jar and blend it in that. Slowly lift the blender wand up towards the mouth of the jar. With this method, the oil does not have to be drizzled in that way (same with mayo). Have a tall cup with sudsy water (or maybe another jar). The blender wand cleans up in no time at all. Simple. Less clean up.  Store leftover dressing right in the jar you mixed it in!  Have another salad with greens, fruit, nuts, and possibly cheese of choice later in the week.... and the dressing will be all ready!

I made this for dinner and used Olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and used dried cherries soaked in water and drained, instead of cranberries.and it was so good.

I have an almost identical recipe from another site & have been making this salad for many years.  It is outstanding and always gets many recipe requests.  I prefer to leave the skins on the fruit & always use Honeycrisp apples and red pears. I also think that using finely grated swiss cheese is really important as it is a strong tasting cheese & when shredded finely, balances nicely with the lemony dressing and fruits.  Be sure to give this one a try!

I really liked the idea of this, but it needed some changes for me.  The dressing was very sweet so I had to cut way back on the sugar (I made a tiny portion first to sample), and I used a raw cane sugar...about2 tbs or so.  And I left the peel on the fruit.  I used mixed power greens instead of romaine as I had no romaine on hand.  I  also used toasted pecans instead of cashews...again just what I had on hand.  My lemon was a Meyer lemon, and I think that added a great flavor.  I would definitely make again with my revisions.  It's a good mix of flavors and textures.

This has become a Christmas tradition at our house. It’s easy to make ahead and just add the apple and pear before serving, or toss with lemon-lime soda or lemon juice to keep from browning. I’ve substituted pecans and English walnuts for the cashews. It’s very light and tasty. Thank you for a great recipe!!

I think this salad would be great too as a big salad for lunch or dinner if you add chicken.  Could even add left over turkey after the holidays.

Wonderful. I used walnuts instead of almonds, and left out the oil.

Great salad for the winter, and good for you. I did use a sweet and sour poppy dressing (Martins Grocery), and added Dijon mustard. Worked perfect. I also used Montery Jack cheese. I believe any cheese will do. However I used Walnuts I had on hand, I will use different nuts next time.

This salad was a huge hit, although I did make a few minor adjustments. 1)Substituted Splenda for the sugar. 2)Sub'd Organic Spring Mix for the Romaine. 3) Sub'd Feta for the Swiss. 4)No nuts & no apple. The dressing was the perfect balance of sweet and acidic. Will definitely be using this recipe again!!

Oh my god I loved this salad, with a few changes from suggestions here. Made it for Christmas Eve dinner. Used a bit less sugar, canola oil, one head of boston and one head of red leaf lettuce, definitely skip the cheese, and use pecans!  Roasted pecans made the dish.

Amazing! I left the skins on the apples and pears to add to the festivity (I made this for a big family Christmas dinner potluck, so the red and green skins looked perfect!), and I also used an Italian lettuce blend instead of romaine, which I think added a little extra punch. The ladies in the family LOVED this one; it got many compliments. No leftovers, and we've been using the extra dressing to throw together delicious and quick salads all week. The dressing alone should get at least 6 stars... great find. Thank you!

Quick, easy salad that everyone loved.  Since I had a lot of new recipes going at once I opted to buy pre-prepared poppyseed dressing, which worked fine. i will try the dressing portion of the recipe in the future.

Took this to a function of close to 130 people. They loved it. I made some changes. I juiced the lemons in the juicer, left out the poppy seeds and as one person suggested I poured a quarter of the dressing over the apples and pears to preserve them. When the dinner was served I poured the apples and pears into the salad which lightly coated the lettuce. That was all the dressing it needed. It was wonderfully light. I served the rest with poppy seeds on the side. It was a big hit.

I made this salad twice over the holidays.  The first time I made it I used two heads of romaine lettuce and made the dressing as directed.  The salad was swimming in the dressing!  The second time I also used two heads of romaine and cut the dressing in half and it was perfect.  I also decided to use craisins instead of regular dried cranberries and liked it very well.  A great tip I read from another reviewer was to store the chopped apple and pear in the dressing when transporting the salad so they don't turn brown - great idea!

This was a good salad, but I would add more greens than called for b/c it makes A LOT of dressing.  As stated, toss right before serving.  Next time, I will add pecans that have been toasted with a little salt & pepper.  Needed a little saltiness to offset sweetness.

Great Salad - all the ladies at my luncheon asked for the recipe.  I did use butter lettuce along with the romaine and used craisins rather than the cranberries.  I peeled and diced my pears and apples the night before so just kept them in a seperate container with some of the dressing covering them they stayed nice and white.  I did not feel like getting the food processor out so just used my electric mixer and the dressing was delicious. I had considered doubling the dressing ingredients but I'm glad that I didn't as there was plenty of dressing.

Great Salad - all the ladies at my luncheon asked for the recipe.  I did use butter lettuce along with the romaine and used craisins rather than the cranberries.  I peeled and diced my pears and apples the night before so just kept them in a seperate container with some of the dressing covering them they stayed nice and white.  I did not feel like getting the food processor out so just used my electric mixer and the dressing was delicious. I had considered doubling the dressing ingredients but I'm glad that I didn't as there was plenty of dressing.

I wanted to prepare something different for Thanksgiving this year and this made a great hit.  It was the only dish that was entirely eaten.  I recently made it again with the request of my daughter who loves it.  I did not change a thing.

Served this at a lunch party I had for my girlfriends.  Everyone seemed to like it.  It was sweet and a nice combination of flavors.  I put the dressing on the side and next time will probably make half the amount of dressing it calls for because I had a lot of left over dressing.

This was delicious. I had walnuts so I roasted them and intended to use them with feta cheese...when I got the salad onto the table I completely forgot the feta! It was good but I can imagine the feta would have made it even better! The dressing was delish too...I think that my poppy seeds might have been on the old side:( (that explains my 4 star review) Will get some fresh ones and try again. Good for a change from the same old salads.

Huge hit!  I used feta and toasted walnuts instead of swiss and cashews.  I'm curious about the flavors of swiss and cashews in salad, though, so will try them next time.

Great Recipe!

I made this almost exactly as called for (but used baby spinach instead of romaine) and everyone raved about it. I cut the fruit ahead of time, but was unsure which was the best advice to take to keep the fruit from browning (soak in sprite? soak in some of the dressing? soak in lemon juice?), so I soaked some of the fruit in each of the suggestions and they all worked beautifully. I'm pregnant and am eating pretty much only toast and saltines these days, so can't give my personal review, bit everyone at the table really loved it. I served it before the main meal so everyone would be sure to really give it a fair go, as I was expecting big things of this salad. It did not disappoint. We also don't have a cheese grater (I know it's crazy) so I just cut the swiss cheese into little cubes. And I used two green (granny smith) apples, one green (bartlett, i think) pear and one asian pear. It was really pretty on the table and had great presentation as a "fancy" salad. "Spinach and Strawberry Salad" from this site is my other favorite "fancy" salad that you can whip up super quick and daze and amaze your friends with. In both instances, I suggest keeping the dressing on the side and just drizzling a bit over the top of the individual plated salads- then putting extra dressing on the table if people want more. Both recipes make way too much dressing, and if you toss the salad in the dressing, it can be overpowering. Tossing the salad with the dressing also makes it im

This one is a winner! Prepared exactly according to the recipe, with one small exception. Used a bag of salad mix for speed. (Iceberg lettuce with carrots and red cabbage). The combination of sweet, salty, tangy from the meldiing of all the ingredients was wonderful! My husband said he didn't think he was going to like it, but now he can't wait for me to make it again. Thanks for sharing this wonderful combination!

We loved this salad.  I served it with white cheese chicken lasagna from allrecipes some warm bread.  The dressing seemed like a lot, so I halved it and it was perfect for 6 people.  Next time I make this salad I am going to substitute the swiss cheese for feta cheese and mix in some spinach leaves with the romaine.  I can hardly wait to try this again.

This was the "highlight of the table" at our friend's Reformation party.  The only thing I did differently was to use walnuts and almonds instead of cashews as that was what I had on hand( I doubled the recipe and used walnuts on one salad and almonds on the other.)  I made the dressing as stated, usinig the bottled lemon juice since I had a lot on hand.  Will be making this again!

This was the "highlight of the table" at our friend's Reformation party.  The only thing I did differently was to use walnuts and almonds instead of cashews as that was what I had on hand( I doubled the recipe and used walnuts on one salad and almonds on the other.)  I made the dressing as stated, usinig the bottled lemon juice since I had a lot on hand.  Will be making this again!

I made this to take to a dinner party, and it was a big hit.  I made exactly per directions, except substituted walnuts for the cashews.  I was a little scared about the dressing - I couldn't get it to thicken as much as I thought it should, but tasted great.

FABULOUS!!!  I substituted an organic baby romain blend for the iceberg and goat cheese for the swiss.  It was perfect.  Only used half the dressing though.  Guess I'll have more salads this week!   Yum!!

This is the best salad! I found it last year for Thanksgiving and my family raved and raved. I also took it to work for our Christmas dinner and the boss said "I want this salad at least once a month". It has become a staple.

The dressing for this salad was very similar to an older recipe that I had and lost. I took this salad to a church potluck, Made some changes I had no lemons, but used 3 Tbsp cider vinegar & used Splenda instead of sugar.  As recommended by many others I used a different kind ofr cheese (Edam, small cube) also drained mandarin oranges, left out the nuts, many with nut allergies.  This recipe made a lot of dressing, but it will not be wasted...will keep to liven up quick daily salads, Thanks for the great recipe*****Lots of

I loved this salad!  I didn't follow the measurements exactly on the salad, I just eyeballed it.  I did follow the measurements for the dressing and it was delicious.  I served this on Christmas Day with turkey and two casseroles.  After reading another reviewer's idea to add mandarin oranges, I added three clementines.  I really loved this salad.

This turned out really well— I’m not a fan of pears, but in this salad, it works really well. INext time I won’t add so many craisins (the hubby felt they overwhelmed the dish, although I disagree), but otherwise

This salad was delicious! I used a little less sugar than 1/2 cup and I used 1 1/2 Romaine hearts (and could have added more as there was plenty of dressing). I also substituted a second apple instead of the pear and used Craisins instead of cranberries because I didn't have the original ingredients. For my own salad, I add some steak and that was really delicious too!

This salad was delicious! I used a little less sugar than 1/2 cup and I used 1 1/2 Romaine hearts (and could have added more as there was plenty of dressing). I also substituted a second apple instead of the pear and used Craisins instead of cranberries because I didn't have the original ingredients. For my own salad, I add some steak and that was really delicious too!

This was so easy and yummy.  I prepped  a baggie of the cranberries and nuts. I subbed pecan pieces since I had them on hand.  Then, the next morning, I made the dressing and kept in a shaker.  A few hours before eating, I peeled and cored the apples (used two, since pears were not ripe enough) and dressed the salad. The apples really help up under the lemony dressing.  I also omitted the cheese to keep this lighter. I also required more than one head of romaine for the amount of dressing.I would make all types of versions of this salad again. It was a hit. Was even able to use leftover apple/nut/berry dressing parts with fresh romaine for lunches the next day.

Sickeningly sweet! I added onion and garlic trying to mellow it-but it didn’t work. I wish I used less sugar as some suggested. I used olive oil which was bad because you could taste the oil flavor. Now that it has sat from the 24th to the 27th the olive oil flavor is blended and fine. So if you are going to use olive oil make it at least a day in advance. I did blend in my bullet so don’t think I didn’t mix it enough. Next time I will use pecan instead of cashews. I like cashews but they were strange. One out of five people commented the dressing was good- I would hardly call that amazing or a hit.  But I can imagine how this can be good so I may try it again.  Also I’m vegan so I omitted the cheese.

A family pot-luck favorite.  Cut the fruit early and add the dried berries and fruit to the dressing to marinate for an hour or two prior to serving.  Also delicious with pecans and feta instead of cashews and swiss.

Substituted slivered almonds for cashew. Delicious and everyone loved.  Does not keep more than a day. Next time I will add dressing to individual servings instead of on entire bowl.

One of the best salads I've ever had or made. Nothing needs to be changed in this recipe. Great dressing. I couldn't find my dried cranberries, so I substituted some red grapes, which seemed just as good. Will definitely make this again.

Made several times. If you cut pear and apple ahead, coat with small at of dressing to prevent browning.   Also soaking dried berries in dressing helps distribute flavor.  I cut back sugar and oil as others indicated and serve dressing on side.  Dressing will keep in fridge.

Tasty salad. I didn't find the lemon flavor of the dressing as appealing as others, probably just personal preference. I may try it again with regular poppyseed dressing.

I only made the salad dressing and it was pretty good.  The only change I made was to reduce the oil to 1/4 cup (when I cut the recipe in half).  I also slightly reduced the amount of poppyseeds.

Very good recipe. I would cut the sugar a bit next time, maybe 1/3 or 1/4 as it was a bit too sweet for my taste. But overall, crisp and refreshing. I served it at my usual Monday night dinner party of 8 men and they all gobbled it up.

Oh My!!!....How good it is!!!!  Only used 1/4 C. sugar as we don't like anything too sweet.  Thanks Nora (was my grandmothers name...don't see it too often!) LaCroix for a wonderfully way to fix fruit.

Fantastic salad.  I've made it numerous times for holiday parties and it's always a hit.  The Lemon Poppy Seed dressing is fabulous.

Beautifully bright flavors for a winter evening!  My young boys and husband all enjoyed it and asked that I make it again next week. Following previous suggestions to keep the dressing separate, I now have my lunch ready for tomorrow. I can't wait to share this at a potluck! Thank you!

I doubled this recipe because I was having 16 people for lunch.  There was plenty to go around.  People helped themselves to seconds and asked for the recipe.  I did not peel the fruit, other than that I made it exactly as the recipe states and would not change anything.  Hint: the dressing is delicious but makes more than you need to coat this salad.  Try using about half of it.  You can always add more but if you use the whole batch you will have salad dressing pooling on the bottom of the salad bowl.

I needed to make the salad for my culinary class and this recipe was perfect for the job; we were doing a mystery ingredients thing like on chopped or master chief. I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to substitute some things but in the in it came out great. 1) instead of poppy seeds I use roasted sunflower seeds, cashews into cornflakes(one of the mystery items we has to use), the berries into blackberries(same as the cornflakes), I needed to make the salad for my culinary class and this recipe was perfect for the job; we were doing a mystery ingredients thing like on chopped or master chief. I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to substitute some things but in the in it came out great. 1) instead of poppy seeds I use roasted sunflower seeds, cashews into cornflakes(one of the mystery items we has to use), the bried berries into raisins, all American cheese shredded, and that about it but I soaked the apples and pears in lemon juice to keep it from browning. I added blackberries as a topping. It came out looking delicious, too bad I forgot to take a pic. 

I would definitely make this again, in fact I am, I'm making at home this weekend this time cause my mom wanted to try it.

I loved this dressing.  I made it with slivered almonds and without the cheese.  Next time I will use pecans and add feta cheese.  Will make it again soon since I have so much dressing left over.

What a fantastic salad! I've made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks and everyone has given it rave reviews! I made it EXACTLY the way the recipe was written and several of my guests asked for the recipe. My daughter said she's never had a craving for a salad until having this one! It makes a very large batch (I used 2 and even 3 heads of romaine one night) and plenty of dressing. It's a nice salad to make for company and compliments many main dishes very nicely. Definitely a keeper!

Lots of compliments!  Quick and easy to make.  I used my favorite poppy seed dressing (store bought) and tossed the pear and apple in lemon juice.  It was perfect.  Will make again!

Very good!  Made this several times and it was a big hit.  Added some mixed baby greens to the romane lettuce. Agree with some others if you cut the apples and pears before, except if you use asian pears, toss with some of the dressing so they will not turn.  Definately will make again!  Thank you for the recipe.

I've been making this recipe for years perfect for Thanksgiving because dressing and fruit can be prepared early in morning and doesn't take frig space; only difference in my recipe and this one I use two pears and two granny smith apples with skin on. Make dressing first. Then cut fruit and place in large salad bowl. I just pour all the dressing over fruit in morning and place Press & Seal over fruit to stop it from browning. Wash & Dry Romaine crisp in Frig. Measure out 1/2 cup whole cashews and 1/2 cup cranraisins seal in baggies. When ready to serve. I tear up lettuce into bite sized pieces toss with fruit/dressing mixture. Sprinkle cashews & cranraisins toss. Then top with finely shredded swiss cheese (much like Parmesan a Caesar Salad)

I've been making this recipe for years perfect for Thanksgiving because dressing and fruit can be prepared early in morning and doesn't take frig space; only difference in my recipe and this one I use two pears and two granny smith apples with skin on. Make dressing first. Then cut fruit and place in large salad bowl. I just pour all the dressing over fruit in morning and place Press & Seal over fruit to stop it from browning. Wash & Dry Romaine crisp in Frig. Measure out 1/2 cup whole cashews and 1/2 cup cranraisins seal in baggies. When ready to serve. I tear up lettuce into bite sized pieces toss with fruit/dressing mixture. Sprinkle cashews & cranraisins toss. Then top with finely shredded swiss cheese (much like Parmesan a Caesar Salad)

This is a recipe I have made for quite awhile.  Everyone always raves about it and I ALWAYS have to make it when our daughter comes to visit.  I never had a name for it, so I just call it Yummy Salad. It really, really is!  Thanks for sharing it.

I actually just cut the bottoms off of two hearts of romaine and split them over two plates, then drizzled the dressing over both and topped with the fruit, cheese, and cashews.  The result was a fantastic, light, healthy meal!

This is my favorite new salad recipe!  Only change I made was used pecans instead of cashews.  Thanks for sharing, everyone raved and it was simple to put together.

I love this recipe. The only thing that I do different is using less oil. I use only half of the recommended amount. Otherwise is perfect.

My husband and I just scarfed it down, it was THAT good!  I halved the recipe to make 2 salads. I omitted the cheese and  substituted almonds on one salad and pecan halves on the other instead of cashews.  The dressing is so good that I was tempted to lick my plate after I was finished.

This salad is delicious!  I followed the directions for the dressing, but changed a couple things in the salad itself.  I left out the cheese and used walnuts instead of cashews (that's what I had on hand).  Everyone I've made it for loves it!

I did enjoy this recipe but I did make a few changes such as I used strawberries and mandarin oranges although I think you can just use whatever fruit is in season and it would be great!  I also used feta cheese shredded as I could not find swiss shredded but next time I may try swiss.  I also used mixed baby greens and the mistake I made was mixing up the salad minus the dressing and drove it to a BBQ about 1/2 hr away and then it sat for another 1/2 hr before we ate and it had wilted a lot.  I did dress it then but only half of the dressing as it makes sooo much!  I am not sure if I like the lemony flavour or not I used bottled lemon juice so I may cut back next time.  I also may use romaine next time as well but Caesar salad was also being served so I wanted to be different.  Overall the mixture of flavours and textures was very yummy therefor 4 1/2 stars!

Great for get togethers...tried it at a friends party and came right home to make for the rest of the family.  Delicious anytime of the year...am going to make it today for a side with hamburgers/hotdogs on the grill! Im making enough dressing to keep extra in the fridge to make prep easier during the week.

Loved it!! I FELT I NEEDED TO UPDATE THIS REVIEW.  I MAKE THIS DRESSING EVERY TWO WEEKS - EACH TIME I MAKE 4X'S THE RECIPE - THATS HOW MUCH WE LOVE IT!! FYI - INSTEAD OF POURING THE OIL IN SO SLOWLY HOPING IT WILL THICKEN ENOUGH TO NOT HAVE TO STIR UP THE POPPY SEEDS EACH TIME - ONCE YOU HAVE BLENDED IT - BLEND IT FOR 5 MINUTES WITHOUT THE POPPY SEEDS. IT STAYS BLENDED AND YOU HARDLY HAVE TO STIR IT.....ALSO - DO NOT USE "RED ONIONS" OR YOU WILL HAVE "PINK" DRESSING,,  :(

Super yummy and enough dressing for double the salad.  I also cut the sugar in half and used pecans instead.  Oh, I think the salad would taste better without the swiss cheese or use parmesan cheese instead.  But dressing is very good!

This is an excellent salad and dressing.  It has been a hit with everyone I've prepared it for.  A friend served it for my husband and me and I had to have the recipe.  She turned my on to allrecipes.com and I'm never at a loss for something to cook.

The use of lemon (overall alkalizing)rather than vinegar is a nice change with the same results, balancing the acid of the sugar just so. We like it enough that I have a carafe of dressing on hand, a bowl of chopped fruits tossed with a bit of dressing to prevent oxidation, and greens with other ingredients in separate bowl. It can last up to 2 days without noticeable deterioration. Thank you for sharing.

5 stars for the poppy seed dressing. Recipe worked well as a base for one's own creativity - you can't spoil this especially with the wonderful poppy seed dressing. The pears in the store were not ripe so I used strawberries - feta cheese - cashews and sliced almonds - mixed spring greens - used more apples than called for and did not peel. Not inexpensive - but great for a crowd - I was serving 17 - with corn chowder and yeast rolls everyone was applauding.

This is one of the best salads I have ever had.  Made it for Christams and again for New Years Eve.  Doubled the dressing to have more for second salad.

Very good salad that is colourful and tasty. I'm not sure the cranberries add a lot to it, so I may leave them out next time and try it with shredded sharp cheddar instead of the Swiss cheese. Thanks for the recipe.

This salad was delicious.  I made it for three different holiday parties and it received rave reviews each time.  I used Splenda in place of sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Even my 1 year old devoured it.

This is so yummy & easy...everyone was asking me for the recipe for the dressing.  I changed up the salad a little to accomodate what was on hand.  Used the suggestion of raisins soaked in orange juice since I didn't have any pears (very good).  Also used candied pecans instead of cashews.  Will definately make again!  Thanks.

Delicious and unique salad.  Freshly squeezed lemon juice made the dressing wonderful, but I only pured about 2/3 of it on the salad and it was plenty.  Served this with Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!

I also served this salad for Christmas and it was a hit. The creamy and sweet dressing blends well with the fruits, it's excellent.

I made this salad for Christmas dinner. My mother and I loved it. The men at the table thought it was okay, but none of them like sweet salads, typcial ranch or blue cheese type guys. My 4 yr. old son loved it too. We loved the combination of the fruits with this light, lemony dressing. A keeper, at least for us girls.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and my family asked me to make it again for Christmas!  Beautiful AND tasty.  I substituted 1T dried minced onion in a pinch and dressing still turned out great!

Awesome salad!  I brought it to a ladies' Christmas luncheon, and it got rave reviews.  Just the right combination of citrus and salad.  As another reviewer suggested, I juiced fresh lemons for the dressing.  It was definitely worth the effort!
