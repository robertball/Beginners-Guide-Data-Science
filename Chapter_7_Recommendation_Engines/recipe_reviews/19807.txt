For the creamiest, most luxurious ice cream, cook this custard in the traditional method, bringing as close to 185 degrees as possible, but do not let it come to a boil. Remove from heat, strain, then add vanilla.  Cool in ice bath, then chill mixture several hours or overnight before churning. Almost as good, and certainly a lot easier because you don't have to cook it, is simply to beat the eggs till light and fluffy, about 1-2 minutes, add the sugar, beat another minute, then add to cream mixture with vanilla. Whichever way you choose to do it, don't whip the cream. This will cause a lot of "overrun," or air volume, which you don't want. (This is what the inexpensive brands of ice cream do) I wanted a clean vanilla ice cream flavor, so I eliminated the lemon juice and, since I like my "frozen custard" super rich, I used half and half instead of the milk.  So long as the step of whipping the cream is skipped, this is excellent ice cream.

i admit i changed this a bit by not whipping the cream at all and just putting it in and mixing it then putting it in the freezer, but when i did this it was just like Haagen-Daazs in my opinion - dense and rich  thanks and i hope i didnt upset the creator by modifying it a bit!

Wonderful!  I used skim milk as that was all I had at home and didn't whip the cream before combing everything.  This is a nice, smooth ice cream.  Doesn't have a filmy, fatty after effect.  Also doesn't get as rock hard as other recipes I've tried.  The lemon juice cuts the sweet slightly, making it a perfect homemade ice cream.

Very rich and creamy texture.  I will definitely use this recipie again.  I didn't whip the cream before mixing it together with the egg mixture because I wanted a more dense texture.  I was very happy with the results.  I also did not have enough lemon juice, so I just left that out.  Wonderful recipie!!!

I agree with the user who said this was like frozen whipped cream.  The flavor was fine but the texture was all wrong.  It was so light and fluffy, not near rich and creamy enough.  I noticed several reviewers said they did not whip the mixture at all.  Perhaps I will try it again with out whipping.

I really like this recipe-itis a good basic ice cream recipe. I made it a few times and I used egg beaters and fat free half and half instead of heavy cream.  I did not whip it either.  I tried using Splenda instead of sugar, but it was not as good.  It was just good to be able to make a fat free ice cream that was delicious!

I compromised and beat my heavy cream a little, but not enough to form peaks.  Nice and creamy...a bit like McDonalds soft serve.  Only made 1/2 a can in my freezer so I had to ration for the friends I made it for.  Got rave reviews from my friends but I think I'll try a different recipe next time.

This ice cream is simply amazing.  I followed the advice of several other reviews and did NOT whip the cream.  Air is not a good thing in ice cream.  I also did not add the lemon juice as suggested, and instead of vanilla extract, I used 1/2 of a split and scraped vanilla bean in the custard mixture.  I also added a couple drops of yellow food gel colour to give it an extra rich look (I love using food colour!).  The suggestion to use a tablespoon or so of alcohol to prevent hardness probably isn't necesarry but I tried it anyway.  I used a 1.5 quart cuisinart ice cream machine and by the time it was finished, it was nearly overflowing with the paddle in.  If you have a smaller machine, consider halving the recipe or only freezing half of the mixture at a time.  This recipe would also be an excellent base for creating your own flavours of ice cream.  A couple handfuls of crushed oreos would be amazing in this!

Great!  Modified recipe: used 1.5 c 1/2&1/2 instead of milk, reduced cream by 0.5c.  Also, didn't fully whip cream, as per other's suggestions.  Smooth & creamy after 1 hr in fridge, eventually got icy in deep freeze after 1 wk.

The BEST Vanilla Ice Cream I've ever had!  I did modify based on other reviews though.  I did NOT whip the heavy cream.  Infact I just threw all ingredients (minus the lemon juice, I didn't add that at all) into a huge glass mixing bowl, mixed it up and stuck it in the microwave.  Every 2 minutes I stirred it until the temp reached 185 degrees.  Let it cool, then mixed it in my Kitchenaid stand mixer Ice Cream Maker attachment.  Next time, I am going to add real vanilla seed and change the serving size to 12 to make just a bit more.

I love the quick (no-double-boiler) method, but recommend cooking until 180-185 degrees for the best results. AND skip the whipping part! Crazy. I used h/h in place of milk and vanilla beans instead of extract. I sampled it this morning (nice 6am treat!) and loved how creamy and delicious this turned out! My bf prefers this recipe over some others I've tried, as it's not too custardy. --I stirred in some crushed oreos to half the batch...oooh what a treat!   (Note: this recipe is nearly identical to Creamy Vanilla Ice Cream.)

Forgot the lemon juice, but that was ok because I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup anyway. I did not whip my cream. I probably will next time, as I rather like the fluffy soft-serve you get at fast food joints, and I may add another egg if I made this specific recipe again. It froze a bit more solid than the last ice cream I made, which had more eggs. Still it didn't freeze TOO solid -- just about as solid as store-bought, really. Thanks for the recipe, it was a great accompaniment to "Bananas Foster II" from this site. I did use naples34102's suggestion to strain my egg mixture and I must say, that was ingenius--I removed a ton of scrambled egg bits by doing that!

12 hours ago I was mentally composing my one-star review of this recipe.  I messed up the first batch of milk/sugar/egg by adding the eggs last after the milk and sugar were already thoroughly mixed. I could never get the egg to mix in properly and as the heat came on it scrambled some. Dumped it out. Began again.  The next batch, rather than taking the 10-20 minutes the recipe describes to thicken, well, it never really got very thick frankly. Another reviewer mentioned getting it to around 180 degrees and I was trying for that. After 35 minutes when it was still 145 degrees and quite thin I gave up because it was past midnight and I had to go to bed. It was not very thick and custardy and it was a lumpy mess. But I strained it and put it in a bowl to chill overnight, having serious doubts about its salvageability.   In the a.m. I put the cream and vanilla (didn't use the lemon) in a big bowl. Since I felt I had strained out a pretty big portion of the milk/sugar/egg mixture I only used 1 1/2 cups of cream and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I wisked the cream for a minute but not long enough to seriously aerate it as other reviewers said that would make the texture weird.   I poured it into the ice cream maker and kept getting ready for work. In the last few minutes I chopped up some frozen cherries and threw in about 1/2 a cup of them plus about 1/2 cup of chocolate chunks. The texture seemed right. I was becoming hopefully that it wasn't a total loss but still swearing to never us

This is the best, creamiest, vanilla-custard ice cream I have EVER had. Seriously. I'm known as "The Ice Cream Maker" by all my friends and family now thanks to this... :-D Amazing.

The flavor was good. But the texture wasn't like eating ice cream..... more like eating whip topping instead of ice cream.

We LOVED this recipe.  This was our first homemade ice cream of the season.  The whipping cream makes all the difference in this recipe.  It is so creamy and not icey like the homemade ice cream we used to have as a kid.  We added a sleave of Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies that we had been saving for months for this very occasion.  This recipe will always be our base vanilla ice cream from here on out.  Loved it!!

This worked beautifully - but I did change things up.  I didn't use the lemon and, like many of the reviewers, I did not whip the cream - in fact, I didn't use cream.  I made it lactose-free by using 1 cup 2% lactose-free milk and 2 cups soy "creamer."  It ended up a little too sweet; next time I would reduce the sugar by probably a quarter cup because lactose-free milk is a little sweeter to begin with.  Also, it's a good idea to temper the egg mixture, just like with a regular custard.  In the last couple minutes of churning I added a tablespoon of Irish cream liqueur. yummy.

I did not beat the cream, I've heard if you beat the cream too much in ice cream it could actually turn into butter.  Also, I used just the yolk.  I added Oreo's after processing the ice cream.

Loved the flavor of this recipe!  I wish I could make it without all the stirring over the stove :(  I prefer the custard style though so I guess I will stir.  We had high humidity the day I made this and it seemed to not want to freeze.

Very easy. Didn't come out custard style though. Came out like frozen whip cream. Still very good. Added strawberries. Made a second batch and substituted whipping cream for pet milk. This time it came out more custard-style. Swirled in caramel and cinnamon pecans. Delicious!!!

Yesterday was my first time to try making a traditional ice cream which includes egg. And the result was great if we compare it by the no egg ice cream. Much creamy and testy mmmm

Try making it with crash oreo and add it after 15 minuets in your ice cream maker. enjoy

This makes a creamy, tasty, vanilla ice cream. I prefer recipes without raw eggs so this has become our go-to vanilla ice cream recipe. Served this recipe 4 times already and always gets raves as favorite ice cream ever.

Allrecipes faux pas here - reviewing the recipe with my basic changes.  heated and stirred everything together in the saucepan until it got to the recommended temperature (~180F - it never really thickened for me much), then cooled it and put it in my ice cream maker.  I skipped the lemon juice (not a fan of the lemon juice plus vanilla combo).  The flavor of this was great - so other than the change in preparation steps, the ingredient proportions were perfect for me.  Thanks!

I've made this recipe twice now, except used half & half instead of milk. It was WONDERFUL, very creamy and rich.  However, both times I got little curds of egg in the batter.  Next time I make it, I will try to temper the eggs, rather than cook them at the same time with the sugar & milk, to see if this takes care of that problem.    Other recipes I've used always temper the eggs, and I've never had curds with them.

I just made this recipe last night with the suggestions by all the other reviewers.  I did NOT whip the cream as was directed in the recipe and it turned out great.  Just to be fun I added a vanilla bean and all it's scrapings while I was heating the milk and it came out with great vanilla flavor.  I also suggest going the traditional method of tempering the eggs before adding them to the heat.  Overall a greate vanilla recipe.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe. Left over ice cream that we've made in the past got very hard stored in the freezer.  This did not.  It was great the next day as well.  I want to try it with peanut butter and with pureed strawberries.

I made this recipe Sunday morning and left it in the refrigerator all day. We churned it late in the afternoon. It was so good and creamy. Everyone loved it. It was very hot outside so it melted quickly. There was none left over. Thank you for sharing.
