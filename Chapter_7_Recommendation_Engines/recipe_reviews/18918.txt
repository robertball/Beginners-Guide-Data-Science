My husband liked this. I would of liked it to be a creamier. I also thought the amaretto was strong.

I don't like a lot of alcohol flavor so I cut the amaretto by half and it was sufficiently flavorful without being overpowering. Doesn't make 4 servings though (maybe 2). More of a thin milkshake than a smoothie since smoothies typically have fruit. Next time I might increase the amount of ice cream slightly to make it thicker. Great flavor though and easy to make.

We made these on Christmas Eve. My daughter swirled chocolate sauce at the rim of the glass inside and let it run down before I poured the drink in. It looked so pretty! I added a bit more than called for of the amaretto. Very yummy!

Yum! It was great! I added just a touch more ice cream and I substituted almond milk for regular milk. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing! The recipe indicates that it makes 4 glasses but I just finished drinking it by myself in two glasses. 4 glasses would mean tiny servings. And FYI 4 jiggers is equivalent to 6 ounces just in case you were wondering! So you could just guestimate and put in a little less than a cup (8 oz) of the amaretto and milk. This is truly a delicious recipe and would make a nice party drink. In my opinion the alcohol was not strong at all and I am not a big alcohol drinker so I think you can take my word for it.:)

Really good summer treat. I added some chocolate syrup and more amaretto liqueur. Very rich.

How can you go wrong with an Amaretto Frappe? I added a smidgeon more ice cream than called for so it would be less strong and it turned out perfect.
