Please try this one--it sounds kind of strange, but believe me, it is great.  My son discovered it on this site, and tried it out on us.  Delish.

I made this with rice wine vinegar.  The skin was pretty crispy, but the flavor was not very intense.  I think that I will marinade the chicken for awhile before grilling to boost the flavor.

This was some tasty chicken.  There was way more marinade than was needed for only 4 breasts.  It would have served for easily double that amount.  Next time, I will halve the marinade; I don't like to waste ingredients.  Didn't need all the salt, either, since the poultry seasoning I used already had salt in it.  All in all, the chicken had good flavor, but nothing overpowering.

This recipe is for 4 halves of chicken not 4 chicken breasts. You have to tend to it a lot but if you do it right it is a delicious meal you will not forget.

I basted every 10 minutes like the recipe said but like others have mentioned it didn't impart much flavor into the chicken.  I think this is better suited for a marinade.  I'll try it again as an overnight marinade.

Surprisingly good! The apple cider vinegar made it tender and added a hint of sweetness. I wasn't in love, but I liked it a lot and will use it again. I marinated the chicken for an hour prior to cooking. I'm not sure it would taste as good if it were not marinated.

My wife just loves this recipe.

I use a Cookina Grill mat to keep the juices while the chicken is grilling and add a bit of Rosemary to the sauce

I used it on chicken legs.  It was good but not something that I'd probably use again.  I didn't find it tangy at all, but the poultry seasoning did make it taste better.

This was awesome on boneless chicken breasts.  I was unable to find the old poultry seasoning tha I was used to.  I found a flaky poultry seasoning.  I sprinkled some on chicken and let it sit a few hours.  I had five pounds of chicken breasts and could have used way less of the marinate.  Will likely cut recipe down to a quarter or a third.  Very tasty flavor.  I can see me adding other ingredients depending on desired flavor.  Cumin comes to mind as well as a little hot sauce!
