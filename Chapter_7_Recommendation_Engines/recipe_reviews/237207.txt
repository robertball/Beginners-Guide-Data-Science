This is full of flavor and is very versatile in its use--as stated by the submitter.  I put some of my leftovers on a turkey sandwich that I had for lunch, and it was great!  Thank you, brenda!

Delicious.  The flavors are amazing.   A little too spicy for me though, I cut the red pepper in half and still too hot.  Think I will skip it altogether next time.

Very good and different sauce. Used less oil and cooked less time to keep vegetables more crisp tender. Yummy.

I made this with a few adjustments. I used  one each of red, green, yellow and orange bell pepper. I omitted the cayenne and used coriander instead of cumin.  It was just the right amount of spicy and I put this on top of baked tilapia. It was delicious!

This was easy to put together. I didn't use Worcestershire Sauce but used white wine instead.  I would have used red wine if I had any.  I did add the black beans and served it on rice. I also used fewer red pepper flakes.

Yummy.  I did not add any cayenne and halved the pepper flakes.  I was worried it might scare off the family if it was too spicy and a whole teaspoon of pepper flakes is a lot!  Turned out really spicy anyway and I like spice so be warned!  I also used fresh parsley and basil since I had them.  

Never would have thought of worcestershire and ketchup but I liked that part.  I think this is a starting point from which to come up with a mushroom and pepper saute.
