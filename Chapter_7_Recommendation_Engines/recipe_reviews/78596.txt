I made this dip for my book club last night.  Unfortunately, it wasn't very well received.   I think the main problem is that the goat cheese takes over the flavor and that comes as kind of a surprise (given that it isn't called "GOAT cheesey artichoke dip."  I cooked it exactly according to the directions, but it came out kind of dry and crumbly - probably because of the consistency of the goat cheese.  If you are a big fan of goat cheese, you'd probably like it, but not if you are expecting your average artichoke dip.

Really really good especially with the dill flavor. I substituted the artichokes for 'spicy' artichokes - a little added kick.

Very good.  Very easy to make.  I had non-herbed got cheese and marinated artichokes (which I rinsed) and it still turned out really well.  My husband said to decrease the mayo next time, but I think it tastes good. As a previous reviewer noted, there is a strong goat cheese taste.  This is a positive for me, but if you're not crazy about that flavor you may not enjoy this. I really liked it overall.

This dip was a huge success at our Sunday football get-together! In my opinion, it was better than the full fat version found in restaurants!

We really liked the idea of this dip and we loved the goat's cheese factor, but for us the texture and consistency weren't right.
