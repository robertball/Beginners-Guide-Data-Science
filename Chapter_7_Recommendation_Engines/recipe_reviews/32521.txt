I wish there was an option for 6 stars!  This is great.  Ok here's what i found: 1 1/2 cups coffee = 6 ice cubes.  I only made a half recipe so that was 3 ice cubes (frozen coffee cubes), 1 cup milk - and i used 2T chocolate and 2T caramel syrup plus 2T sugar.  It was still very sweet so next time I'll omit the sugar and just add a little at a time to taste.  It is a little runny for my taste so I added 4 regular ice cubes to help make it more frosty.  This recipe is very easy and can easily be adapted to make all the specialty flavors for frozen coffees (peppermint, oreo, etc.) - just watch the sweetness.  I also double-brewed my coffee (made it regular then ran the brewed coffee thru the machine again like it was water with the same grounds as the first time) to make it more intese and used decalf (all I had on hand).  YUMMY!

Great recipe!  Wendy is absolutely correct to tell us to use ice cubes made of leftover coffee (they don't dilute the flavor the way regular ice would).  I give it 4 stars only because I think you should sweeten this (and all iced coffee drinks) with simple syrup instead of sugar.  Sugar doesn't dissolve completely and leaves granules.  Simple syrup is simply 1 part water and 1 part sugar.  Boil together till sugar dissolves, cool.  You can store this in your refrigerator for weeks.  (I work for a coffee company.  ;-)

Very good. Next time, I'll try it with whipped
cream on top and putting chocolate 
syrup on the inside of the glass. The coffee ice cubes was a stroke of genius. EDITED REVIEW: Now that I've adapted a healthier lifestyle and am eating lighter, I cut the milk back a bit and use either two tablespoons french vanilla flavored sugar free creamer or two tablespoons fat free evaporated milk, my homemade sugar free chocolate syrup and if it's not sweet enough, a couple packets Truvia sweetener. It's every bit as good as the full fat version.

Awesome icy treat! Perfect for when you want to have the "coffeehouse experience" right in your own house. I just used cold coffee and crushed iced in my blender as I didn't want to take the time to freeze the cubes. I also used skim milk. This made more than enough for me and my husband to share. It was so good topped off with a whipped cream and little more chocolate syrup!

Like other reviewers said, this really does resemble a mocha frappachino at Starbucks, which happens to be my favorite!!  Very good - I have added caramel to mine as well, giving it a slightly different taste.  Will now be saving my $5.00 at Starbucks by making my own for pennies!  Thanks!

What else can I say but WOW?!?!  The consistancy is perfect! I added a half teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe and poured it into some pretty glasses.  My friends and family like it coffee shoppe style with whip cream, a sprinkle of cinnamon, a bit of chocolate syrup, and some chocolate sprinkles on top. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I LOVE IT!!!! It was so incredibly good. It actually tastes alot like the coffee coolatas from Dunkin Donuts. I made it at work tonight for my boss and coworker, they absolutlely LOVED it. My boss actually came looking for more. My only advice is, if you're going to make this, make sure you make enough!

Ok, I didn't read the recipe all the way through and I neglected to freeze the coffee into cubes (what kind of cook am I? I know, I know) and didn't realize until too late. Oops. So I just blended all the ingredients (my coffee was cold) with a hand blender and poured over crushed ice. Yum. Next time I make these I'll do it the right way but it's fine just the way I did it today. Very very yummy with just the right amount of sweetness. Perfect for when you want your coffee but it's hot and muggy outside.

This was very tasty! It's really sweet, which may be a problem for some but was perfect for me. I used double-strong brewed coffee for my ice cubes. I scaled the recipe to serve half as much, it turned out very well. This tasted something like a Starbucks Mocha Frappucino--I'd definitely make it again!

Great recipe - I always had powdered chocolate milk mix, not syrup, and it's still awesome.  Can't wait to try it the right way!  Yum!

These were okay, but nothing special, and too much work, what with the blender, for something that wasn't all that great.  Won't make again.

This recipe was pretty good! It was a bit too sweet for me, so i didn't put in the chocolate syrup. But it was still a good refreshment.

WOW!  I used instant coffee and skim milk and this was still delicious.    I'll be saving the $3 a cup I normally pay at my favorite bookstore. Wendy, thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This is awesome!  I bet the caffeine content is lower than what you would normally get.  Another option is not blending the ice at all - adding it last.  I've had a lot of fun with this & my guests love it!

Loved it!  Tastes delicious... great way to get caffeine in the mornings, and so much cheaper than buying a Mocha Freeze at a coffee shop somewhere.

easy and good.  Also a great way to use leftover coffee from the morning.  This is a great drink on hot summer nights.

I've started freezing my leftover coffee so that I'll have a few cubes on hand so I can make these.  I make some simple syrup as suggested by another reviewer.  The whipped cream on top really adds something.  Not quite as good as a drink from Starbucks but a pretty good home version!

This was good, but not GREAT. Very sweet.. I made mine with Decaf coffee.. so that might have been the problem. But I am pregnant (decaf is the only way to go for me right now!) I might try it again later with regular coffee.. but wouldn't make it again with decaf!

Loved it! This is just like a mocha frappucino from Starbucks- and a lot cheaper!  I used a whole ice cube tray of frozen coffee, 1 1/2 cups skim milk and 1/4 cup half and half, 3 tablespoons sugar and 1/4 cup chocolate sauce.  It was pretty sweet, next time I'll use less sugar.

Followed the directions to a tee.  Not enough flavor for us.  Liked the idea of coffee ice cubes.  Won't make again.

I've had this recipe saved for a while, and finally got the chance to make it! It was delicious! I used 4 cubes of frozen coffee, 1 cup of milk, 2T of caramel and 2T of chocolate syrup. I did not use regular sugar at all. I have a Magic Bullet blender, and I used 1 mug, and this made just enough to fill up the mug! It was very good!

Yummy but too sweet for me, not enough coffee flavor, and rather thin.  The second time I made it, I adapted it and used an entire tray (12 cubes) of coffee ice cubes and used only 1/8 cup (or 2 TBSP) of sugar instead of the full amount on the recipe.  It turned out much better for my taste!  I will keep this adaptation and look forward to possibly adding caramel or cinnamon next time.

This recipe seems very familiar to another one I made on here, but I decided to give it a try. I followed the recipe but I used lite chocolate syrup and 2 packets of Truvia in place of the 1/4 cup of sugar. It turned out really tasty. I topped with whipped cream, as suggested, and added a little chocolate sprinkles. The only downside is the frothy aspect of it melts after about 30 minutes, and it turns to an ice cold coffee, but it is still good.

This was delicious! It tasted quite similar to a Starbuck's frappuccino. I added a pinch of salt because it gives it even more flavor. I will be sharing this recipe with family and friends. Thank you for posting it.

This was the perfect late afternoon pick-me-up treat for my husband and I yesterday on an incredibly hot day!  I did think that it could have used a bit more coffee taste, though, so will use more of the ice cubes next time.  Thanks for a great recipe, Wendycain!

I left out the sugar, and didn't have a full 1/4 cup of chocolate, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly... very good!  Now I can save myself some $$$ at the coffee house!

Excellent!  I didn't have time to make the coffee ice cubes, so I put about 8 small ice cubes in the blender.  I also used 1 cup fat-free half & half & 1 cup 1% milk, then blended all together with the syrup, & some International Delight White Chocolate Macadamia I had in the fridge.  I brought the whole blender container to work with me & my co-workers can't stop drinking it!  This will be a staple here at my office:)

Very refreshing and a great way to use up extra coffee.  It makes a pretty iced coffee drink that I could serve to company.  I prefer it served with the whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate syrup.

This was pretty good, but I've decided it's easier to buy a canister of the powdered frap mix from Costco. Sorry! I need the simplicity when it comes to getting my coffee.

I have been making these for years, I love them! This recipe is the same as I use, except I never actually messured mine. The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because the only thing that could make this better is instead of adding all the milk, add just a little and put in a couple scoops of your favorite coffee flavored icecream, then blend. It's Great.

I absolutely love this. I did not add any sugar.  Instead I added a bit more chocolate syrup and it was perfect.  I have tried a few cold coffee drinks from this site and so far this is my favorite.  I am a  non hot coffee drinker (because I don't care for it) but I am hooked on these cold coffee drinks!  Excellent recipe.

Taste is probably more like 3 stars but the fact that I can save 5 bucks by making a cold coffee drink at home bumps it up to a 4.  A little too much sugar as stated.  Definitely worth making when you are craving a coffee drink and don't want to drive somewhere and spend the $$.

This recipe is great! I used a natural low calorie sweetener instead of sugar, and just sweetened to taste. Awesome, and I don't have to trudge to Starbucks and fork over $5!

I've used a similar recipe for several years. I discovered that it's better to use chocolate ice cream or a powdered chocolate drink mix. Chocolate syrup tends to give the coffee a bitter taste.

Loved this drink.  I did however only use 1 cup of milk, as many reviews suggested, and the consistensy was perfect.  We actually like them BETTER than the Tim Horton's Iced Cap.
Thanks

Been working in the garden & this was such a refreshing treat! I halved the recipe (except for the chocolate...I absentmindedly added the full amount) only it was runny so I had 4 more coffee ice cubes. I did not doublebrew my coffee as Bonnie suggested but I think next time I might. I guess because I had so much extra coffee flavor, the chocolate wasn't too much. I did not use simple syrup as suggested by some reviewrs because I didn't figure I would need as much sugar as called for & I was right... I didn't add more than a tsp or two. I did top w/ fresh whipped cream. Still not quite as good as Starbuck's but close & they don't serve it in a pretty soda glass either. ;o)

Try using hot fudge sauce instead of the chocolate syrup- tastes like a McDonalds frappe.

Yummy!! I have made this recipe several times, first time without freezing the coffee into cubes and although it was good, it wasn't the 'WOW this is really good!'. So the next time I froze the coffee into cubes and oh my goodness this was sooo good! Highly recommend taking the time to do this step as it makes a huge difference. I have made this many times now as I freeze all leftover coffee and keep a ziplock freezer bag of cubes in my freezer just for this recipe. I have added caramel, chocolate and Rolo syrup and it is amazing!

Fantastic treat.  I used 3/4 cup frozen coffee, 1 cup skim milk, 2 T chocolate syrup and 2 packets of Splenda sweetener.  Yummy, I know this would have cost $5 at the coffee shop.. and I know what's in this one!

What a smart idea about the frozen coffee! I have made this three times so far and I love it. Ive also added carmel before and it was sooooo good. The last time I did it I cut the sugar out and just did the chocolate syrup and it was still great!

No ice cube trays on hand?  I'm an iced Mocha Lover.  Here is my EASY ICED MOCHA recipe in case you want it now & don't have ice cube trays anymore:    Simply take some of your leftover COOL coffee (twice-or thrice brewed if you like that Starbucks taste) put into a tall glass, add Hershey syrup and some half & half to taste, adjust to what you need more of, then add your ice.  I like a lot of ice in my coffee and strong, so be aware, it will dilute over time.  I'd add more cubes of leftover coffee if you like this recipe strong.  Add a few drops of vanilla if desired.  The leftover coffee frozen in trays in this recipe is a wonderful idea for those hot summer days and a great way not to waste coffee as costly as it is these days.  Start the freezing now, Iced Mocha lovers.  The taste is great and a lot cheaper than buying an iced mocha from Starbucks.  Save your $5.00.  Good luck!

This was AMAZING!!!!! I made my own version to this though. I froze the coffee in the ice cube trays but when i out them in the blender I used Cinnabon creamer and a dollop of choco syrup. I left out the sugar all together, it doesnt need anymore sweetness. I fell inlove with this drink at first taste...its now apart of my morning routine with my son. he likes pressing the blender buttons so we make mommys coffee than make him some chocolate milk so he feels included. Can't say enough how much I LOVE this drink!!

My husband was expecting Iced Coffee instead. I told him 'No, it has chocolate syrup in it, too', because I don't like plain iced coffee. Mochas it is for me.
He loves it. I love it. He says it's better than Starbucks. I've never had Starbucks iced mochas, so I can't compare. He is a coffee fanatic. We've made it a few times since, and it does NOT need tweaking.

Edit: Instead of making ice cubes and blending it all, I just throw everything into a half-gallon jug (after doubling the recipe) and stir. Add ice - optional.

Great!! I took someone's advice and used about four "ice" cubes and a cup of milk to make one fairly full glass of this (enough room to add whip cream which I think really sets this off). It was amazing. Lots of money will be saved now. Great thing about this recipe is that it seems like it can be played around with a bit; using different flavors of coffee, with different syrups. I think adding a mint syrup in addition to the chocolate will make this a great holiday drink!

This was awesome and super easy. The only change I made was that I only used about 2 tablespoons of sugar and that was perfect. I also topped it with whipped cream...yum :)

I always have left over coffee and thought the idea of making it into iced mochas was brilliant. I just tried this recipe for the first time and have to say it is absolutely delicious. I just used splenda instead of the sugar. Thanks for such a great idea, I wont be spending my money at starbucks or dunkin donuts anymore. This is way better and so much cheaper.

This is great!!! My husband loves Iced Mochas and is very critical of types other than Starbucks. He rolled his eyes when I made this for him but now having chocolate syrup and coffee ice cubes are a must in our house.  Instead of buying chocolate syrup though we buy a java syrup at the store.  This really tops it off for us.  ENJOY!!!

We went through a faze of making too much coffee, so stumbling upon this recipe seemed like a great coffee saver. IMO, it's not worth the trouble. The coffee ice cubes always ended up getting stuck in the trays, and we couldn't come up with a method of getting them out. So, for a while we would use any salvaged cubes in plain old iced coffee.  A nice way to have cold coffee without watering it down.

Very good. I used more frozen coffee that asked for and it turned out great. Otherwise, it would have been too sweet.

Don't let the short list of ingredients fool you.  I didn't add the sugar or the whipped cream because I figured it would be sweet enough for me with just the chocolate syrup and it was.  This was so good!  The taste reminded me a lot of Wendy's Frosty.  The only thing different I'm going to do next time is use expresso rather than regular coffee just because I like to be able to taste the coffee a little more.

This is great and easy.  I make the coffee ice cubes double strength.  I substituted 1/2 c milk with 1/2 either hazelnut coffee cream and reduced the chocolate syrup to 2 Tbls. I didn't use any sugar as the flavored creamer is sweetened.  Ran through blender and partially froze (about 10 minutes).  Served with whipped cream and drizzled caramel and chocolate syrup on top.

This drink is pretty good.  I like  the recipe most because of the frozen coffee cubes.  Great way to save and use up leftover coffee.  I found it a bit sweet, so next time I may reduce the sugar or chocolate syrup. THX

Way good, I didn't make any coffee ice cubes and poured the still semi hot coffee over regular ice cubes (the way I make iced tea). Still turned out great! Saves me 4 bucks at Caribou!

After a few adjustments, I am absolutely addicted to this -- and I don't like coffee.  I wound up using chocolate milk and DaVinci gourmet carmel syrup -- sugar free, no calorie.  It then has a chocolate, caramel flavor with no additional calories, other than the chocolate milk.  Even have my husband hooked, and he doesn't like traditional coffee either.

Thank you so much for this recipe and all the helpful tips from fellow reviewers! Based on some of the reviews, I used 6 coffee cubes, 4 ice cubes, 1 cup vanilla Soy Dream, 1/4 cup Hershey's Chocolate Syrup and 1/4 cup Smucker's Caramel Sundae Syrup. Serious yumminess!! Woohoo! And pennies saved! Thank you again! :) I shall see how it tastes next time with 3 tbsp chocolate syrup and 3 tbsp caramel syrup.

These were sooooo good.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I made one batch chocolate and the other batch caramel.  Topped with whipped cream and drizzled with syrup, these made a great snack.  Even better than the coffee shop's!

This is the mocha recipe I have been looking for!  I had some leftover espresso from Starbucks (from another recipe) so I froze it in an ice cube tray.  I used 4 cubes and then followed the recipe exactly as stated.  Absolutely amazing topped with whipped cream and chocolate.  Thanks for the recipe!

A perfect combination. I thought about leaving out the sugar but after I tasted it, I realized it DOES need the sugar.Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome!  I save all my leftover coffee by freezing into cubes and storing in a container in the freezer.  That way I have them on hand when I'm ready to whip this yummy drink up.  I use 12 cubes at a time.  I use caramel sauce instead of chocolate and only use a pinch of sugar if any at all.  I top with whipped cream and more caramel sauce and a straw and get compliments all the time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Thank you for a great recipe! I omit the sugar and just add lite chocolate syrup. Now, if I could find a way to make them at work...

I modified this a bit, and it still turned out to be an amazing coffee treat! I made this with 1/8 cup sugar free chocolate syrup.  I also used 1/4 cup equal instead of sugar.  I used 6-7 cubes of frozen coffee and 1 cup of milk.  I might try to use skim milk next time.  This would cut the calories down to about 140 a serving. YUMMY!

This was excellent!! Although I don't think I followed much of the recipe when it came to measurements.
I was unable to check back online when I made this and I couldn't remember the amounts so I just kind of guessed. 
I put 12 coffee ice cubes, a little over 1/4 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup chocolate sauce, and 3/4 cup of milk into the blender.
And instead of putting whipped cream ontop I topped it off with ice cream.
Not the healthiest of drinks but it sure was good!

My sister-in-law made this for us one day and it was wonderful. She substituted caramel syrup for the chocolate syrup and only used one cup of milk. It makes it really thick like at a coffee shop.

I won't pay for overpriced coffee, so I've never had Starbuck's. Even tho I've nothing to compare this fabulous drink to, I thought it was amazing. Took others advice and cut back on the milk. I actually made this without any sugar at all and it was still delicious. Thanks so much Wendy!

Wonderful flavor, I used caramel instead of chocolate syrup, and only about one cup of milk, a little more if needed just to get a nice consitency.  These are just as good as starbucks, and believe me it will save you some bucks. Loved it.

WOW! Five stars does not begin to descripe this recipe. We LOVED it!!! we didn't have any chocolate syrup, so we used the chocolate milk powder we had just lying around. It was almost as good as going out to Starbucks but for way less money. 
Thank-you for sharing this recipe

Wonderful!  After reading the reviews, I decided not to follow the milk and sugar amounts exactly.  I figured everybody likes different amount of sugar and milk in hot coffee, so why would it be different in iced coffee?  I did end up using less milk and sugar than the recipe called for.  It was so creamy and yummy.  I topped with freshly whipped cream and extra chocolate syrup.  So good!  Thanks!

After reading other reviews decided to omit the sugar as I'm not big on sweet coffee, used extra strong instant coffee (needed instant gratification) added a little extra chocolate to make up the sweet and just poured over ice. Absolutely perfect better than the ones you get at the local drive thru for $5.00 or more!

Absolute GENIUS!!!  My husband and I love Starbucks' and even McDonalds' iced mochas and iced coffees, but they're so ridiculously expensive!  A cheaper alternative for a while was to buy International Delight Iced Coffee, but even that was expensive--half a gallon for four bucks or so!  Now, I can use stuff I have on hand and just buy the syrup--waaaaay cheaper, and my husband is in love with this stuff!  I made a caramel version with caramel syrup, and it was sweet, but still awesome.  Thanks, Wendycain!
EDIT: I made this iced coffee again today, but instead of freezing the coffee cubes, I just mixed it up with some coffee that had cooled off, and mixed it up in a big 4-cup measuring cup. (Make sure you put the sugar in with the coffee first and stir well; if you put the milk in at the beginning, it'll be too cold to dissolve the sugar.) I made it with the carmel syrup again, and added an extra cup of coffee to the original 1 1/5 cups so that it wouldn't be super sweet.  Then, I poured over ice to still make it iced coffee.  A little less fuss and planning, and still awesome!

I used this recipie as a guide to make it my own.  I used the frozen coffee cubes, omitted the sugar all together and replaced some of the milk with flavored coffee creamer.   I'm addicted to the flavored coffee creamers, I even use them in my oatmeal in the morning!!   I love this coffee!!  So refreshing on a hot day!!

Loved it! I did make a few changes. I used less sugar and chocolate syrup and poured into hot coffee. Used the same amount of milk and poured over ice. It's a regular treat for our family.

This was the best iced mocha i've ever tasted! It had a rich flavor and not to sweet. The whipped cream and chocolate syrup really did it, plus it looked beautiful. I would make this everyday if I could!

Great idea to freeze leftover coffee!!  In this hot weather I look forward to making one of these almost every day.  As a diabetic I substitute Splenda and a little sugar-free syrup (carmel or vanilla) and a bit of sugar-free chocolate syrup for mocha flavor.  I use skim milk and a little fat-free half and half.  Everyone I have made this for loves it and can't believe it's sugar free.  I have to skip the whipped cream....but it's so good even without it.

A very easy and cost-efficient way to enjoy an iced coffee :)  It wasn't too sweet at all for me as I only put enough sugar to sweeten the coffee to my liking. Also, I omitted the chocolate syrup as I thought it would "water" down the frostiness of it - anyway, I like my iced coffees plain, without any additional flavouring :P  In the past, I've tried the "blend-coffee-with-ice" method, which never really worked out - the coffee  got too watered down. This method, however, avoids that as the coffee is frozen into ice cubes.  As well, it's alot less fattening than the iced coffees I usually make with ice cream - I only add 2% milk and a splash of half & half cream.  Thanks for posting this recipe! I will now always keep an ice cube tray of coffee in my freezer! :D

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT! I have used vanilla creamer with it too. Delicious and so easy. It doesn't water down as it melts. No more stops at the coffee stand this summer.

Thank you for posting this incredible recipe. It is better than starbucks iced mocha but I recommend to half the amount of sugar. My husband loves it.

I thought this was good but not great. I didn't use the amount of sugar it called for. I just added a little at a time until I liked it.  It was very runny but like I said it still was not bad at all. I will make again but next time maybe try a little less milk and 1/4 cup chocolate syrup was a little sweet for me.

I love making these. I used to make these at work when I worked in a restaurant. I love to add one splenda, a tbsp of milk and sprinkle some cinnamon on top. yummm... and if possible, add a shot of espresso. It always woke me up for a busy shift!

My husband and boys says this tastes just like Starbucks. I don't drink coffee, but I make it for them so I can't give my personal opinion. However, I know they won't leave the house without it! And, I make the coffee, let it sit for a while to cool off and add it, because I never have the time to make it the night before. It doesn't hurt that I don't have an ice cube tray! ; ) Nonetheless, my guys say 5 starts!

How fun is this! I made just one serving, which was about 5 coffee cubes, slightly more than 1/2 c milk, an old sugar packet I had, and I eyeballed the syrup -- probably about 1 tbsp. So yummy! Thanks for sharing! Like others have said, I will rarely need to go buy coffee drinks now. I'll just open my own shop! :-)

i have been making my own coffee drinks for years and never thought of freezing the coffee into ice cubes. i use vanilla creamer, milk, chocolate and caramel syrups so it is sweet enough without the sugar. thanks for the great tip of freezing the coffee.

mmm... My husband forgot to take his coffee this morning and joked that I would "have to drink it all myself".  Well let's hope he forgets it more often!  I did make changes- simply due to impatience.  I didn't make ice cubes- I heated coffee enough to melt sugar, put everything in blender with few ice cubes- still yummy- will try it correctly tomorrow!

As to my taste, I didn`t like chocolate syrup in this beverage. This was too rich and heavy. With almond syrup or caramel it would be better for me.

As others have said this is a really great idea/recipe.  It's so simple to do and delicious.  Freezing leftover coffee using ice trays is very easy.  You can adjust how sweet or chocolatey it is to your liking.  Made them for husband and I yesterday morning and he really liked them!

Loved it! What a brillant idea freezing coffee into the cubes. I used 6 cubes to 1 cup of milk - 1 tbs chocolate syrup, 1 tbs Smuckers fat free caramel sauce and 1 tbs of Nescafe French vanilla coffee syrup. All stuff I had in the house...I didn't need to add any suger. Very good!

This was just ok. It was a little too sweet for my taste so I would definitely cut back on the sugar. I will try it again though with less sugar.

Great coffee drink!!
I omitted the sugar and used vanilla soy milk along with sugar-free carmal syrup. Tasted similar to Starbucks Carmel-Light Frapp.

This was really good.  I didn't have chocolate syrup, so used hot fudge sauce instead...it probably balanced out my using skim milk.  This is a nice, quick treat to make for a caffeine-loaded breakfast.

Pretty darn good!  I am a Frappuccino junkie, and that habit can be as expensive as crack!  This is just as good, crazy easy, WAY cheaper, and I don't have to leave my house to make it.  I did make simple syrup, as one reviewer suggested, instead of using granulated sugar.   I don't drink regular coffee, but my husband drinks a LOT.  He uses a French press and I just sneak up behind him and nab the last half of his pot of coffee to freeze.  Easy, easy, easy to whip this up in the blender.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!  :)

This is great, it's mighty close to the storebought ice coffees - it's just a bit of hassle to freeze the coffee. If you want it extra creamy, make the coffee with  just enough water to  dissolve the coffee and the rest milk.

There are really nice, and taste just as good with caramel sauce instead of chocolate syrup. Try them, you might get hooked.

Super easy to make and it came out amazing! I used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate syrup and it made around 2 1/2 generous servings.

It layered up the first time I made it, so the second time I added 4 or 5 regular ice cubes and it did better. Taste just like Starbucks!

This is so awesome. I halved the recipe & used random silicon molds since I don’t own regular ice cube molds so I’ll have to tweak it because it was liquid with all the milk. I also used simple syrup instead of the granulated sugar.

This recipe was good, but was definitely a lot off work. Pouring the coffee into the tray, blending it all, that was to much for a simple mocha. In the end, the ice didn't blend fully and it was mostly chocolate.

I halved it based on another review (5 cubes, 1c milk , 2 tbsp sugar, & 2 tbsp choc sauce). Had to use rice milk due to a dairy allergy. Also mixed the sugar, choc, and the milk in my measuring cup prior to blending to make sure the choc/sugar didn't settle to the bottom of the blender. Tasted GREAT!!! but not icey thick enough for my taste. Next time I'm going to back the milk off to a half cup and increase my cubes to six to see if I can get the consistency I want. The flavor was perfect though! Can live with it even as is.

I'm always looking for recipes from others to either help my own or put a new twist onto the same old same old. Not only was this a great recipe but also  very close to my recipe....here is the small difference in which I hope help others in the future.  **FIRST** -  I use half and half instead of regular milk ( helps give it a nice creamy & smooth texture ). **SECOND** -  I sweeten my coffee  before I pour it in the ice cube tray, that way you don't have to worry about the  sugar...it will melt completely and you won't over sweeten it if you add at the end...so sweeten your coffee at the beginning ( while hot ) instead at the end. This will not effect the freezing process. Everything else is the same....place cubes in the blender along with the other ingredients it top it off with whipped cream  ( preferably fresh whipped cream...so much better I think - but dealers choice of course ? ) and finish it with a drizzle of chocolate syuryp. YUM!!!!  I went on vacation with my whole family and for 5 days straight I was asked to make this by my nieces and nephews...they asked me to write this recipe down for them so they could make it when they got home.

These are great! So easy to make with my single serve Ninja blender. I started freezing my leftover coffee in ice cube trays, and I've been experimenting with different ways to use them. This is a winner! It was especially good with a little whipped cream and more chocolate syrup on top.

Wow! Talk about coffee house experience at home! This is great! I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings and used my usual stevia instead of sugar. And since I was going for a Starbuck's wannabe, I topped my glass with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. (3/4 cup coffee = 7 ice cubes)

So good, so easy!  Reading other reviews, I decided to taste it as I added the ingredients, so that the ratios would match my taste.  I'm glad I did because the recipe does NOT need any sugar, and only half of the chocolate syrup.  My version tastes exactly like a Mocha Frappuchino.  Next time, I'll add a bit of vanilla.

Very tasty, but I found it not "slushy" enough. I think next time I will blend on a lower setting. Thank you to Bonnie for your measurements (6 cubes =  1 1/2 cups). I went with 4 cubes in a 1/2 serving also. What I really like is that I'm lactose intolerant and I can use my lactose free milk in this recipe.

OMG OMG OMG! I am so excited!  I love Tim Horton's ice caps and the closed one is 1 hr away from us.  I followed the review of the person who said to use 1 cup of milk and sub in caramel syrup for chocolate.  It really does taste like an Ice Cap!  The only thing is, I think next time I'll use less sugar, the caramel syrup has plenty of sugar in it on it's own. I liked the fact that it was thick so I think I will keep on using just one cup of milk. Thanks so much for the TO DIE FOR recipe!  (even though I made it a little differently!)

This is a great recipe for summer whaen it's hot out. It tastes ,just like a cafe near, Jitter's Iced Mochas but it's definatly cheaper to make this yourself. It take a while for the cofee to freezre though but the cofee was only like 1/2 way frozen but it still turned out great! Also if you don't have an ice cube tray you can just freeze in something else and then put it in a freezer bag(so it doesn't make a big mess) and crush it down. I am definatly making this many more times during the summer! Try it trust me if you don't your missing out on a very tasty drink!

yummy this was great! I made a few changes in mine, but it still turned out great, I didn't have any chocolate syrup so I just threw in some Ovaltine that I had. I also didn't use as much sugar and milk, but it still tasted great!

Yum!!  This was excellent.  I didn't add all the milk because I like my frozen coffee a little on the thick side.

I'm almost at a loss to describe how good this was.  I used a simple syrup as someone had suggested, which worked very well.  My sweet tooth won't be bothering me for a while, for sure.  And that's not a complaint!  The ice/milk/sugar ratio is perfect.  I can't wait to use that as a base for other flavors, like vanilla or almond.

Good recipe.  Has a wonderful flavor, but is a little on the runny side for me.  Maybe using a few more ice cubes would help.  All in all a wonderful recipe to play around and experiment with.  Extremely easy to make and nice to enjoy on a hot day.  Thank you for this nice recipe.
