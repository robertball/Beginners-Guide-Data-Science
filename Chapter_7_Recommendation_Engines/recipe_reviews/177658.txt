I really enjoyed this.  It reminded me of bread pudding.    UPDATE:  I just made this recipe again, but used a different casserole dish. You should really bake this in a shallow dish.  It doesn't bake through well at all in a deep casserole dish.

After reading every review I decided to take everyone's advice, so I tweaked this recipe ALOT...and even added my own twist! I cut the eggs down to 4 and the milk down to 2 cups. I added 1 tsp. cinnamon powder and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. I also cut the vanilla extract down to 1 tsp. but added in 1/2 tsp. almond extract. I also added 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I let the casserole sit overnight in the fridge before baking it for 50 minutes. I also topped it with sauteed apples, with cinnamon and chopped walnuts, after it was baked! With all these changes, it was VERY good! I would definitely make this again!

I have made this a couple times for different clients who have come to stay. By the time I get to dish up for myself, it is gone (I am talking scraped the bottom of my pans out). They all LOVE it.  Added a little extra cin. and baked it about 10 to 15 min. longer.

I've made this dish twice for office brunches, and everyone loves it.  I use white bread instead of cinnamon bread and just add cinnamon to the egg mixture.

This was horribly bland.  I was expecting more of a cinnamon taste based on the bread, but it didn't have it.  If you want cinnamon flavor, add your own.    It also was hard on the outside and undercooked inside (we got around this by serving the outside pieces then sticking the rest back in the oven to finish cooking).  I've made other breakfast casseroles like this without the same problem, so it's not as if I was expecting more than the recipe should have delivered.

Made this recipe for Christmas morning and everyone loved it.  I made it the day before & then baked it in the morning.  This was such a simple recipe to follow.  We loved the cinnamon bread.  Thanks!

I made this for my daughter's school picnic. I used the Brown Sugar & Cinnamon Pepperidge Farm Swirl Bread. I also only soaked the bread in the custard mixture for 30 minutes.(running late) It came out great for the texture I was wanting. Syrup was optional, although I thought it made the dish. I brought home a empty pan. I still have people asking for it.

This was very easy and tasty. Thanks for the recipe!  I did make it up the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I made it as described, and I didn't experience the 'eggy' taste others complained about.  Be sure you use ALL the milk called for in the recipe - I believe this will avoid that eggy taste (I noticed one of the reviewers who had the eggy taste only used 2 cups milk).  Be sure to dust with confectioner's sugar as the little extra sweetness really adds to the dish. I would also recommend adding a little bit of cinnamon to the egg/milk mixture - I am definitely going to do that next time I make this. I made this in a 13x9x2 dish and it baked up beautifully in 50 mins.  My husband had 2 large servings and is looking forward to leftovers in the morning!

I did add 1 tsp. of ground cinnamon, which helped with the flavor, but my family didn't ask for this to be made again. I could only fit 1/2 of the frenchbread loaf in the pan, and the pieces seemed to be the right thickness.  It was a bit mushy in the middle, so would recommend longer cooking time, but then you risk burning the top. I probably won't be sharing this recipe.

The only change I made was 2 cups milk instead of 3 as my family likes eggy french toast. It was very delicious! The house smelled absolutely heavenly! My grocery store didn't have Pepperidge Farm Cinn. bread but it had Cinnabon Cinn. bread and it had a lot of cinnamon flavor. Nothing needed to be added. So if your grocery store has Cinnabon brand, I highly recommend it. Served with pure maple syrup.

The french toast casserole is WONDERFUL! I made it for my fiance and his groomsmen. It taste so good. It is better to use a 9X13 pan so that most of your bread is covered. After reading a great deal of reviews, I decided to use only 2 cups of milk and 4 eggs. Although this did turn out great, the top later was a little  hard and dry. The bottom was nice and moist though. After I allowed the casserole to cool, I cut it up into big chunks and layered it in a smaller dish in order to give a thicker look. I also made some icing that I would use for cinnamon rolls to put on top. It was great and gave the casserole the moisture it needed. YUMMY!

I had a loaf of PF raisin-cinnamon bread in the freezer, so I used that, and I would use it again.  The raisins really added some moisture to the casserole.  The one criticism that I have and was mentioned in another review is that it was "eggy."  At times, I felt like I was biting into scrambled eggs, so I will try 4 eggs the next time.  Six large eggs measured 1-1/2 cups and another three cups of milk would have overflowed my dish...I added just two cups.  I had a few pecans left, so I chopped and added them, along with a healthy grind of fresh nutmeg.  Served with a drizzle of caramel and a dollop of whipped cream.  One of the best things about this breakfast casserole is that it's EASY (but tasty, too).  If you have an electric knife, pull it out and use it for cubing the bread.

My husband loved this!! I would have to say that I agree with the other reviews that this casserole was not sweet enough for me. I will try to add some more cinnamon and brown sugar next time.

overall it wasnt terrible!

This was OK. I think it needs to cook a little bit more. Mine was a little mushy. It didn't get eaten up like I was hoping for. Not much flavor. It needed something else!

This was a hit with my family!  I changed the milk to half and half and added 1 tsp of orange extract which gave it a nice flavor.  I also added extra cinnamon (about 2 tsp) to enhance the flavor.

It was a bit too "eggy" for my taste and not sweet enough. I would like to experiment with this recipe. Maybe one less egg and some brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

Did my own variation of this.. USED White bread.. about 16 slices, I added to diced apples, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1/2 C of crumbled brown sugar, 1/4-1/2 C of coconut, cinnamon and nutmeg... mixed all together the dry ingredients... then whipped the 3 cups of Milk, 6 Eggs and 2 teaspoons of Vanilla together.... and poured over dry mixture and sat in fridge for 1 hour--then poured into a large baking dish and dotted with butter.. baked at 350*F for approximately 50 minutes...

The flavor and smell is amazing but it remained mushy and uncooked through to the bottom.  Very disappointed in the final product.  Would love to know how to prepare it so its cooked all the way through.

This was pretty good, my son and boyfriend liked it a lot.  I used Thomas's raisin bread as it is thicker, and cut 1 egg out of  the mix, used skim milk and cooked it for 1 hour. I followed some of the other reviews and added brown sugar only 1/8 of a cup, it was too sweet . I would make again without the sugar.

I followed this recipe.  However. I made a  streusel topping - 1 stick butter, 3/4 c. brown sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  It was a hit at work.

I made this for Christmas morning and it turned out very soggy.  It smelled delicious cooking, but I couldn't stand the texture.  I left it in the oven for much longer than it called for, hoping it would dry out some, but instead it just burned.  Ended up throwing it out!

With a couple of changes, I give this five stars.  I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 pan along with a 3 quart shallow dish.  I used 12 eggs, but only 4 cups of 1% milk.  I added extra cinnamon to the egg mixture.  I did sprinkle about 1/4 cup of brown sugar over the cubed bread before adding the egg mixture.  Delicious!

This recipe was just OK.  I guess I was just hoping for a little sweeter flavor, and I did not like the cream cheese in it.

While it does smell nice while it is cooking, I had to cook it way longer than the recipe stated.  It still didn't seem to get cooked thoroughly.  My family didn't really like the texture.  Not something I will make again.

I make it exactly as is however typically need to cook it 15-20 minutes longer.  I always make it the night before and leave in the fridge.  I made 2 today for a house full of 9 and it was definitely a favorite!

As written, this recipe would barely make it to okay for my taste. I dislike eggs, so my french toast has to have a lot of spices. After adjusting it I love it, and would give it a 5. I used suggestions from many reviewers. I used the Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Swirl. Due to my fear of ending up with a soft, squishy mess, I only used 4 eggs and 2 cups of milk. I also used a 9x13 aluminum pan that a sprayed with cooking spray. To the eggs and milk I added: 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/4 unsweetened shredded coconut. I let it sit overnight in the pan. Before popping it in the oven, I used a spatula to flip the bottom layers of bread to the top. I baked for 50 minutes as instructed and it had a perfect, firm consistency, with a bit of a crunch on top. It's just 2 of us, so we've been slicing pieces off and warming them in the microwave. I've been enjoying it as dessert without need of syrup or sugar.

Prepared this last night but did change it up. I cut down eggs and milk as previous post had added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinn.
This came out like Cinnabon casserole rather then French toast. I really liked it. If or when I make it again I will use regular bread.

This recipe couldn't be simpler!! This was a wonderful casserole to share with family on Xmas morning!.  Prepared it the night before, as directed, except added a little more cinnamon to the egg/milk batter.  Also used a 13x9x2 pan.  I think letting it sit overnight in the fridge really helps the bread soak up all the wet mixture, so you don't end up with a soggy mess.  Next time, I will use the cinnamon raisin bread for a twist, and maybe even try the carmelized apples, nuts and brown sugar topping a few reviews suggested.  Great casserole to prepare the night before, pop into the oven that morning and be able to enjoy your family and company :)  If you want a terrific meat/cheese accompanyment for an over the top breakfast try the Hashbrown and Egg Casserole recipe here - my family went nuts with both these casseroles xmas morning!!

Great Christmass dish we have a large family for breakfast and this is a hit every time.  I use regular bread and cinnamon also add sugar for a little extra sweet. 6 teaspoons cinamon, 1 cup sugar to mix beat well then poured over bread.  THis gives the flavor the pepperidge farms lacks.

OK, so I tried this recipe last night. I used the exact amount of milk and bread and egg. I cooked it at exactly 350°. After 50 min's of cooking this messy soupy looking goop was not even close to being cooked. So I ended up cooking for it another 45 minutes just to get the middle somewhat not so runny. Maybe the 3qt dish was too thick? Or maybe the amount of liquids were too much.  It seems like the recipe has way too much milk (others call for only 2 cups not three) and 4 eggs (not 6). I planned on making this for my work, we're doing a treat every Friday and this Friday is my turn. I am glad that I practiced over the weekend before.

It was veeeerrrryyy good. Both my kids liked it, and my son who won't eat pancakes or regular French toast had three helpings this morning!  I used another reviewer's suggestion and reduced milk to 2 cups and added 1 box of cook and serve vanilla pudding. I sprinkled brown sugar and chopped pecans on top as well. It cooked up very nicely, had a great texture and consistency too. I'm excited to make it for when I have house guests as I hate spending so much time in the kitchen in the morning when I should be visiting:)

I used the Pepperidge Farm Raisin Cinnamon Swirl bread and it turned out yummy!  I baked it the night before and just re-heated it in the morning.   It still turned out very moist.  I made it in an 8 1/2 x 11 baking dish. Super easy to make too!

Cooked this Christmas morning & it was a hit!  Cooked it exactly as the recipe called for.  I just used the maple brown sugar bread option from Pepperidge Farms.  Had leftovers & kept it in the fridge covered & even good re-heated.  This casserole has a bread pudding texture.

Took longer to cook as others have mentioned - simple to put together but not a crowd pleaser...will keep looking.
