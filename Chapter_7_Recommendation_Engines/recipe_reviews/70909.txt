Great - but different - meatloaf recipe!

I was kind of hesitant when I read this over - having no glaze, and no "stuffing" (bread crumbs, cracker crumbs, etc.) - but was VERY pleasantly surprised how this one turned out.

I enjoyed it as is - but others prefer the "traditional" glazing...

Next time I'll tweak it for them - but I'll enjoy it either way ;);)

Excellent!!!!  Have made several times and my family loves it.  I almost left out the hotsauce, but it gives great flavor and does not make spicy.  Yum.

This is probably the best meatloaf i have ever had! It definitely was different from what i am used to, but it was also the easierst one i have ever made! It also goes really well with Baked Corn too!

This was a good recipe. It's different from the usual, and the technique (e.g., step 2 in the directions) was interesting. It was even unusual to use an 8x8 instead of a 9x5 loaf pan (I used a Pyrex dish). I made it pretty much exactly as written, using a good-sized white onion. In my case, 1 hour of baking left it slightly underdone in the center, so I should have opted for using a meat thermometer as suggested. Also, it was a little weird that there was a good amount of water (not fat, although there was a little of that too) in the bottom of the dish - I was surprised it didn't evaporate away. But the meatloaf itself was tasty, and held together pretty well, despite the lack of breadcrumbs/egg/etc. It lasted me for three pretty big dinners' worth.

Wife liked it enough to take for work lunch day after and called home to say how much she liked it. Three sons swarmed it.

I liked the technique for this but it was very bland.  I will make it again with more seasoning.

This was okay. Tasted like a sweet meatloaf... Was expecting a " tangy" flavor.

Very good! Great flavor and loved the idea of cooking in a square pan. Can't wait to eat it on a sandwich today!

I was a bit skeptical of this recipe but decided to try it anyway after reading the positive reviews.  When the sauce was cooking, my house smelled heavenly.  I liked the flavor but did find it a bit on the bland side.  Next time I make this I will make some extra sauce to use as a glaze after baking.  I found that an hour at 350 was a bit too long so I will try 45 minutes next time.
