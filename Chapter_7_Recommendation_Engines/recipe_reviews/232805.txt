These pancakes were awesome! My Omi used to make these, she called them apple fritters. I used 4 small Empire apples as they were not good for eating anymore but great for cooking. I did need to add a few extra tbsps of flour as the batter was a bit thin. I ate them with icing sugar but my sons had homemade maple syrup from our neighbours farm.

I will make it again but use less milk. Batter was too watery, causing the pancake to cook before apples softened.
