I was a little skeptical about this because i am a big fan of Quesadillas but i figured i would try it. i loved it. This seems like it could also be a great dip sauce.

I'd use a little less cream of chicken next time.

I also used shredded chicken and mozza and cheddar cheese instead. tasted great!

These were awesome! I added 3 green onions to the mix just because to me Quesadillas are not the same without green onions. Very quick recipe and delicious served with salsa and sour cream.

Thanks to the other reviewers who suggested reducing the soup...I only used 1/2 and it came out great!  I may add more cheese on my next batch.  But, overall I was satisfied with the recipe.

These were pretty good.  I used leftover bbq chicken that i pulled off the bone and I added corn, just to use up some leftovers.  I used a mexican 4 cheese blend also. I couldn't get my tortillas to seal with just water so i sprinkled cheese on top to act as a glue.  We all enjoyed this.  I will keep this one on file for something quick and easy, especially if i have leftover chicken that needs to be used up.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for one thing- I used nacho cheese soup instead of cream of chicken. My husband said it was the best one he has ever tasted! It is definitely going to be a staple for us! 

One tip: Don't use foil wrapper on the baking sheet, because the tortilla will stick to it for some reason! It is a pain to peel it off the foil & it will rip :/

My family loves this recipe.  I only use 1/2 can of soup and cook the quesadillas on the George Foreman.  I just spray the outside of the tortilla with a little veg oil pan spray and cook them in the GF.  They turn out real nice!  Thanks!

I made this recipe with no chili powder and I used green salsa instead of red. This was absolutely amazing. Even my skeptical husband and picky son loved it.

These were just okay. I think that next time I will use about half a can of the soup. It seemed less cheesier that I was expecting.

I like this recipe, but I made the chicken part a little different and it worked out great.  Just throw chicken in a crock pot and cover with chicken broth or water with chicken boullion (sp?) cubes.  Then add about 1.5 teaspoons of cumin (for four breasts), 1.5 teaspoons of chili powder, three of four garlic cubes minced, couple of teaspoons of salt and some onion powder if you have it.  If you like stronger flavors, just increase the spices.  Cook on low for 5 - 6 hours or high for 3 - 4 hours.  Then just shred it and it's good to go for quesadillas.  I then serve them with white rice (2 cups raw) with the juice of five limes, half a bunch of cilantro and about 1 - 2 teaspoons of salt.  Rice this was is so good.  I happen to be at Chipotle when  the cook was making their rice so I copied what he did.

I made these for a small party that I was having as a finger food snack. They worked great and the flavor was great, with one small change - I used Cheddar Cheese soup instead of the Cream of Chicken. I didn't want an overpowering chicken flavor and for me (and my group) the more cheese the better. I think I added a tad more of the shredded cheese and chili powder too because I like things with a good bit of spice to them. It was a great recipe for its simplicity and because I was able to make the filling ahead of time and plop it in the tortillas when I was ready for it.

I really like whoever came up with this. It's a really unique way to get the overall texture/flavor you are looking for. The only changes I made were using Cream of Mushroom soup (personal preference), usually, chicken has too much flavor.. And I also sauted onions in the chicken while it was cooking and then whenever I added all the ingredients to the chicken/onions(soup, salsa, cheese), I also added three pretty ground up slices of bacon that I cooked. I think it gave it a lot of flavor. I rated it four because they were good and I would make them again, but probably with a few adjustments for even more flavor that I felt it was lacking. But I would definitely make them again, so don't let one little star deter you from them. They're delicious, but there's still room for improvement.

Wonderful!!! I made the chicken in the crockpot and when I got home from work combined the rest of the ingredients.  I did add more cheese salsa and chili powder...And the leftovers are even better the next day. I ate mine on a flour tortilla and also on tortilla chips which was really good too.  This will be a keeper I will make again and again thank you

Pretty tasty and easy! The kids enjoyed it, which makes it a keeper in my house- and you can add or subtract ingredients pretty easily. I used shredded chicken that I had already cooked, cheddar cheese and pineapple salsa because those are what I had, but it made a good, easy meal!

We did not care for this. Tasted like a gravy sauce for rice rather than something to have with quesadillas.

Very good, not authentic but very tasty. Glad I followed recommendation on using less soup. I substituted Cumin for the Chili Powder for my child who shys away from spicy food.

Had leftover grilled chicken breast (Asian grilled chicken) so I wanted to do something different with it! Found this recipe and everyone loved it! I did add some 1/2c black beans and 1/2c corn to the salsa. I also damped the outside part of the tortilla so it would be crunchy. Cooked on  heated them on the electrical skillet for easy access.No more leftovers!

My whole family loves this recipe. I follow it exactly, except I boil the chicken and then shred it and stir it into the sauce. I just find that it's easier than frying it because I can be sure that it's cooked all the way through and you don't have to sit at the frying pan and stir the chicken the whole time. That's just my own personal opinion though. The recipe in general is super-easy, aside from stuffing the tortilla shells. I hate that part, but it's worth it when everyone loves the meal!

The recipe as is is very good. Very simple and fast to make. I tweaked the original recipe to my family taste and used cumin instead of chili powder and added black pepper, sea salt and onion powder. Some of the quesadillas had green peppers and some had refried  beans. All were very yummy and will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe.

It was pretty good.  I added scallions, mushrooms, jalapeño, and garlic.  The sauce drowned out all of the other flavors.  I might try 1/2 the chicken soup next time or just use a cheese sauce.

I followed the recipe pretty much as written, except I only added 1/2 tsp of chilli powder. This recipe was really delicious. Next time I might try adding some chopped up bell peppers and onions.

Simple to make and delicious! Had no time to cook and made this with my partner quickly. I didn't had an oven so I used a toaster for the last step after sealing the tortillas, works just as good! Will be making this for parties next time!

This was actually pretty good.  I would make it again, but it was bland enough that I needed to add enough spice to give it "out taste".    I not only doubled it, but added T of hot sauce and two cans (4 oz) green chili peppers.  Then it was good....I made this a second time.  Used Mozz, same amount of green peppers and added green onions...OMG.  Need I say more.

I used a 1/2 can cream of chicken. Also use seasoning salt, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder and cumin, all to my liking. And I used mild salsa. I like to lightly butter my flour tortillas on one side, add the chicken mixture and add another lightly buttered tortilla on top. Then I brown the butter side and then turn it over and brown the other butter side. I like my flour tortillas a little crispy. I usually dip my quesadillas in sour cream. Yummy!!

Yum!!!  i did make a few changes.  First off, i seasoned my chicken.  I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.  I took some of the others' advice and only used 1/2 the can of cream of chicken.  I didn't have any monterey cheese so i used mild cheddar instead.  Also, since my hubby and I like spicy food, i added a dash of cayenne pepper.  For my tortillas I used the uncooked ones that you can buy at Costco.  (check out if your costco has them, they would be in the refrigerated section, they are sooo good!  but i know that not all costcos have them.)    my husband loved them.  i will definitely be making these again!

This is a good basic recipe. I felt it was just missing some taste. I added onions, garlic and it tasted awasome. Also used low sodium verson of condensed soup.

This is one of my husband's favorite dishes & he doesn't typically like Mexican style dished.  I usually use half a can of cream of chicken & half a can of nacho cheese soup.  It is a delicious & easy to make dish that looks like it's more complicated than it really is.

I would use significantly less of the soup, and perhaps slightly less salsa. the quesadillas were delicious, but the filling was way too runny.

really easy to do....i did it once with the pepper jack soup - fantastic and then again with the fiesta nacho - don't do this unless you want to add lots of cheese and still have it taste like nachos....still like recipe though :)oh yeah and i've done it with canned chicken...that works too.

This was alright.  I think the chicken itself maybe needed some seasoning.  Also, I didn't really love the cream of chicken soup in this, although that may be because I am getting away from canned soups and can really notice a difference when I use them (although I still do use them in recipes in which it is not a "star" ingredient).  I did not add salsa to the chicken mixture, opting instead to add a small can of diced green chiles.  After tasting I found it quite bland, so I also added about an additional teaspoon of chili powder, about a teaspoon of cumin, several dashes of hot sauce and some shakes of salt.  I served it with lots of hot salsa and sour cream.  This was quick and easy, and it was decent enough...just not exactly what I was looking for...

Very good!  I wasn't going to make this one but thought I would give it a shot and glad I did.  The only thing I did was to use two packages of precooked Tyson chicken breast fajaita strips.  YUM

My whole family loved this recipe! I am not a quesadilla person but when I tasted this I am now officially a quesadilla eater with one exception, I will never order chicken quesadillas at any food place I will only eat them at home. Nothing compares to this recipe. The first time I made them I followed the recipe almost to the "T". I didn't have Campbells chicken soup I had Campbells Cheese Soup. It made for a very cheesey sauce, so delicious. The 2nd time I didn't have either so I used Tostitos Mild Cheese dip which made for an even better sauce and WOW I will only use Tostitos Cheese dip now. Superb recipe. Great for the whole family.

I have a quesadilla maker I hardly used because to just put chicken and cheese and other ingredients just never turned out very appealing.  I love the idea of adding the soup.  It made a huge difference.  Would reccomend.  And this is easily adapted for personality changesl ike different meats or add things like onion.  Thank You to whoever submitted this.

This was wonderful!  Although I did tweak it a little as I usually do!  I used almost 2lbs of chicken - shredded - and used the whole can of cream of chicken.  I added more cheese - about 3/4 of a cup I think.  I also used about 3/4 cup of medium salsa.  Then I used some hot taco sauce to taste, to give it the heat that I like.  It was a lot better than I thought it would be!  Oh, I also used whole wheat tortillas!  You will not be disappointed with these quesadillas!  My 2 boys LOVED these with some sour cream on top!

I used canned chicken instead of cutting up chicken breast which made this recipe so super easy.  I usually love using cream of whatever soups but for some reason I felt weird eating it in the quesadillas.  My brain was telling me that it was too "casseroly"...go figure!  Otherwise, I enjoyed the flavor and the ease of these quesadillas.  If I need a last minute idea for supper I would make these again since I have most of these ingredients always on hand.

these were really good but I did add green peppers, onions, black olives and pepper jack cheese also when I make quesadillas I only spread the filling on half of the tortilla then I fold it in half spray each side with cooking spray then pan fry this makes it much easier to flip in the pan then keep warm in the oven if needed

These were so good, my whole family loved them!  I agree with using less of the cream of chicken soup and adding more cheese (I used both Monterey Jack and marble).  I also sauted some orange pepper, onion, and garlic while cooking the chicken.  I am definitely making these again!!  My husband suggested using the left over filling over rice or pasta for another meal.

I substituted a few things.. preseasoned fajita chicken and On the Border salsa instead of Pace.  I also eliminated the chili powder since I used the preseasoned fajita chicken pieces.  Was absolutely fantastic!!!!

This was my first time making homemade quesadillas and they came out great.  As others suggested, I only used half a can of cream of chicken.  I also seasoned the meat with garlic powder and Tony Chachere's seasoning.  I also sauteed onions with the chicken and doubled the cheese.  This is a quick and easy recipe that tastes great.

I'd have given it 4 stars, but my husband wasn't a big fan of the creamy quesadilla  (not necessarily the recipe's fault).  I put cilantro on mine (normally a big fan), but it didn't work as well with these flavors.  If I use this again, I'll probably skip the cream of chicken soup and just use extra salsa and extra cheese.

Very easy and tastes great! I used fat free cream of chicken soup (whole can) which did make them a bit messy,added fresh red peppers in addition to salsa for crunch& I added cheese (Sargento Reduced Fat Mexican blend) on top before baking. Also used 94% fat free wheat tortilla's, will make again; simple & healthy!

Not the most amazing quesadillas I have every had, but pretty good. It takes a little more then half an hour to make, but that could be because of how slow I cook in general. Overall, decent recipe. My mom really enjoyed them, but I was expecting something more cheesy or more spicy, I thought it was a little to creamy.

I found this recipe years ago when I was living on my own, now I'm married with three kids and we still use it so you know it must be good!:) We leave out the chili powder (the original recipe didn't call for it) and add more salsa and cheese.  Pretty messy, but mmm...mmm...good!

These were really easy to make. One thing we thought was that it tasted a little plain. Something was missing....Dont know what, so if you are planning on making this then either have a kickin sauce to dip in or add a couple things and make it your own. I liked this recipe because the sauce you make can be played around with a lot to fit your taste.

After reading the other reviews, I was expecting a lot more than what I got... While it was ok, I wouldn't call it great by any means. Something was missing, I can't pin point exactly what.
