Great recipe.  Awesome with the stated shortening, but if you're like me and want a lower fat one, you can get a great result with 2 tablespoons shortening (just be aware you may need to adjust the water if reducing the shortening).  I double the recipe and keep the leftovers (if any) wrapped in plastic for the morning. Just put it back on a hot skillet for a minute each side and it becomes soft and pliable again.  Scramble and egg, add cheese, and you have great breakfast burritoes!

When I first made these, I was planning on having to later run to the store to buy tortillas because I didn't think that I would be able to make these, since I am terrible at making bread. My end result was exactly what they are supposed to look like. and they tasted much better than store bought tortillas. I was very impressed by this recipe, I found that the video was very very helpful. I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. To be completely honest, I did burn one (oops) because I forgot about them on the stove while doing dishes :) But that was my fault. I wouldn't change the recipe at all, just remember to stay at the stove the whole time. Thank you Chef John for sharing this great recipe, I will be looking into your other delicious looking recipes, they look amazing. Oh, and I did not use a tortilla press, I used a rolling pin. They were very fun to make!

Great recipe, very easy to make. If using a tortilla press, ask your local florist for a few sheets of their clear wrap for flowers. Much easier to use with the press, one sheet can be cut into many pieces. Makes this recipe even easier to make!

Excellent recipe. Couple of tips for the first timer... 1. Use HOT water. 2. Kneed it on a warm surface... your hands, in the bowl, or whatever. You don't want the dough to cool off because of a cold surface. 3. Keep it warm while resting. If your house is on the cool side then treat it like yeast bread and put it in a cold oven over hot water. The point is the dough NEEDS to stay warm. If you let it cool it won't puff like it should and it won't taste as good.

I've made my own tortillas a few times with different recipes from this site. I used this recipe exactly. I thought I'd try this out one but I wasn't too pleased with it. I think it had too much shortening and made them taste a little gummy.

I thought these were alright. The tutorial video was very helpful. Watch it for tips, and definitely use the tortilla press. I learned from making corn tortillas that they are a lot quicker to make on a pancake griddle. The recipe I have used in the past uses vegetable oil instead of shortening. I prefer that, much more, because these were a little heavier, thick, and doughier than what I have made in the past and had a floury after taste I have not experienced in other recipes. I found that a temp. of 350 deg. on the pancake griddle was best for getting the puff, like Chef John illustrates in the video. Was interesting to try a new recipe, but will stick with the vegetable oil version.

First time ever making tortillas. I am living in Ecuador and right now you can't find them in any stores nearby. Now I consider myself fortunate. I never knew they could be so easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. To flatten mine I put down half of a clean clear plastic food bag on the table; another one over the top of the dough and flattened with a pan. Worked fine for me, although when I get home I will probably buy a press.

OK, so Ive made this a few times, at first they didnt turn out perfect, But I made another of Chef Johns recipes, its the pie pastry and you use a food processor to mix up the dough, so I was lazy and I did it this time for the tortillas. I think that is the magic trick! They came out perfect this time, soft and pliable and very good! Every other time I had  mixed it up by hand and they were always a little hard. That is the only thing I did different from times before. I would defiantly recommend using a food processor  to mix up the dough, plus its faster. I also have always use oil in place of shortening.

I live in Tucson, AZ and I have tried many different varieties of tortilla. The "La Estrella" brand is the only ones I buy...until now. This recipe is really good. The tortillas end up with good flavor, they are soft and easy to make. Although, if I make this again, I will be buying a tortilla press. TIP1: Add a little honey to the dough. This helps bring out more flavor. TIP2: If you want to have a fresh tortilla every time, you can freeze the uncooked dough in zip-locks. This way they don't dry out over time, and they stay pliable because you cook them on the spot.

I've made these a few times and they never turn out as good looking as on the video. I'm not sure what I did wrong! they tasted more like an Indian flat bread than a tortilla.

I’ve never made tortillas before and I was surprised at how easy it was.  They came out perfect.  Personally, I prefer them rolled out individually rather than using a tortilla press because I love that they have a more rustic, homemade appearance and don’t look manufactured.

I am on a very low sodium diet so I decided to try these since it is impossible for me to find low salt tortillas. I omitted the salt and used salted butter for the vegetable shortening. They tasted awesome, didn't look as pretty as store bought but more practice will help! The dough came together easily and was not sticky and was easy to roll out. New sodium 57 mg per tortilla, will try whole wheat flour next time.

Love this recipe and we've made them often.  I like to double the recipe and use the leftover tortillas to make a sweet treat.  Spray a plate with cooking spray, place cooked tortilla on plate, spray with a bit more cooking spray and sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top.  Microwave one minute, flip tortilla, microwave another minute,  should be close to crisp (if not continue to microwave a few seconds, watch careful so that it doesn't burn).  Let the tortilla cool, break into pieces, and drizzle honey on top.  Yum!!!  Thanks for an easy and delicious tortilla recipe!

This was my first time making tortillas, and I used a food processor rather than mixing by hand ( same method as making biscuit dough).  It worked very well and saved time.  The texture was good, I did't find them too "doughy" at all, but I was diligent to roll them very, very thin and I think that is probably key in getting a good texture.  I think a tortilla press is in my future!

Amazing. I followed the video and recipe directions to a T, except for using freshly ground flour instead of all-purpose, and they turned out delicious! Oh and one more thing: you MUST put butter or oil on the skillet! I thought he said in the video to cook them in an unseasoned skillet, but that made them turn out gross! Just add a little butter or oil for each tortilla, though, and they'll rise and taste great!

these came out great  only minor changes were to use heat that was not quite as hot and flipped them every 30 seconds for more even cooking. For the person whose tortillas came out too flaky....you need to knead the dough a bit longer to toughen up the gluten in the flour.

definitely the best tortilla recipe I've found so far (and I've tried quite a few).  It rolled out nice and thin, but didn't tear when I lifted it off the counter, tasted great.  I used lard instead of vegetable shortening - it was what I had on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe with well written instructions.

I rolled it out in 3 segments, about a 1/4” thick, coated it in melted butter and cinnamon sugar to within an inch of one edge and rolled it into a cinnamon roll, cut it about one inch pieces and cooked them in a Med hot cast skillet for about 3-4 minutes,  turned over for another 3-4 minutes (dark brown), let cool and they are snack rolls.

I didn't think there was a snowball's chance in you know where that my tortillas would turn out being my first time making them. I will never buy them again! These were excellent. I don't use shortening so I subbed butter. Did the mixing in my kitchen aid mixer using the dough hook but kneaded by hand. I also rolled them by hand using parchment paper underneath without flour. I was able to get them thin enough no problem. My family was most impressed that they were homemade. This is a keeper! I'm excited to make them again.  Thanks again Chef John!

Amazing recipe! I make mine healthier with 1c of whole wheat flour and olive oil instead of shortening. My family loves them. I make a big batch and freeze them for a quicker dinner later on! Thanks chef john!!

I used lard instead. Divided into 4 for larger enchirito size tortillas. Rolled with rolling pin, first one was too thin (trying to achieve the Aztec thin tortillas)  and parts  got  cracker crisp.  Will try the add in of a little honey next time.  Roll out on parchment and flip right on the griddle.

I was worried about making these. I live in Vietnam so a tortilla press was out of the question, also hortning is not readily available here so I used butter. They were a huge hit and easy to make. I have made them a few times now. The last time I used them to make mini pizzas. I used some leftover spaghetti sauce fresh veggies, some ham freash basil and mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Griied in the toaster oven, the critics must have thought they were great (kids) because I never had a chance to try them myself LOL...

The taste was awesome. I had an issue with them being to flaky to roll up for burritos like my original plan was, but I believe that is due to "cooks" error not the recipe. I dont have a tortilla press (but I may invest in one come Christmas) and I may have just rolled them to thin. However, to thin the made awesome flat breads for scooping lol!

Fabulous.  I used 1 cup white flour and 3/4 wheat flour.  I tried to make tortillas before and they were good, but not this good.  The dough came out so perfect and was very easy to work with.  My kids love them!  I think it took me about 10 minutes to make.  A keeper!

First attempt so I wanted to get it right.
Went with Chef John.
Loved the way they came out.
Went exactly with recipe.
Got a tortilla press process even better cause they look better.

Made pork chalupas from this site and didn't have tortillas on hand, so my husband and I decided to try making them.  These turned out good, and easy to make.  We had fun with it.  Might try playing around with flavors just to see what we can come up with, but this makes a good tortilla as is.  As I was cooking them I kept the finished ones on a plate, with another plate over it, to keep them from drying out.

Delicious. I used my Kitchen Aid and had no problems. I used a press, but they were too small to make burritos, so I then rolled them out, which then didn't require any flour and went pretty quickly. Totally irrelevant to this recipe per sae, but just thought it might be helpful.

Ima huge fan of chef johns recipes.  And having a latino boyfriend who can't live without his homemade lantio food I decided to learn how to make tortillas. However the first time I made it,  I thought I did something wrong cause the texture turned out gummy. I tried to make it one more time. But I got the same results.  However they were very tasty.. Might be something I consider when I make pull pork.

Authentic taste. You have to follow instructions precisely. Knead the dough to prevent flakiness and to get a pliable tortilla (for burritos etc.) and let the dough sit for at least 10mins (but don't let cool too much.) For the people saying that they broke when rolling for burritos or tacos, you didn't do enough of either of these steps. I sprinkled or dusted my cutting board with flour rolled some dough into a ball and placed some plastic wrap over and rolled out with a rolling pin to get as thin as possible. *tip* for perfectly round tortillas place a bowl of desired size over flattened dough and cut around bowl to remove excess. So easy and great tasting you'll never buy from a store again!

I followed the recipe exactly and they looked like the ones in the video.  I was making them to use in homemade enchiladas and they are way too thick (even with my husband pressing them with a tortilla press using all his might). They don't roll up (for a burrito or an enchilada) and when I attempted to roll them, they just broke.   These are like flatbread and I will now be using them to make flatbread individual pizzas for our children. (They will love that.)  I am disappointed that I can't use them in recipes that call for tortillas.  I now have to run to the store now to buy some.

These turned out better than when I tried the tortilla mix flour. I even messed up a little with the baking powder but I guess it's pretty much fool proof. Now I just need to learn how to roll it into a circle and I'll never buy store tortillas again :)

This was an easy recipe with really tasty results.  I used unsalted butter because I didn't have any shortening.  I have been looking for a recipe that would make soft tortillas, and this worked beautifully.  I mixed it by hand according to instructions, then kneaded it with my kitchenaid with a dough hook (due to a bad shoulder- I can't knead.)  I also flattened and cooked them (at the same time) with a CucinaPro Tortilla maker.

This was my first time trying to make homemade flour tortillas.  This was a very easy recipe and I did enjoy eating them hot with butter.  The tortillas tasted slightly of uncooked flour.  The only thing I will do different next time is to cook them at a slightly lower temperature so they cook a little longer.  Maybe that will take care of the floury taste.  Other than that I can certainly live with them just as they are.

I love love love these! So moist..just like at mexican restaurants! It's hard not to eat them as you make them. Never buying store bought. These were actually really easy to make as well. I made them in about 15-20 but I'm a slow cook. Thanks!!

Could not be more simple. I used my kitchen aid to make the dough to make it even easier.  Love that they are from scratch - no preservatives, no lard or other weird ingredients and tastes super fresh.  I doubt I'll ever buy tortillas from the store again

Loved the taste, but I did not have tortilla press and they did not come out very large after pressing with another pan.  Taste was excellent, so of course I have to give it a top rating!

The dough was very easy to work with. They did puff up and tasted great. They did come out stiffer and crunchier than I was expecting. Still fold-able without cracking but then crispy too. I tried to pile them up and cover them with foil to sort of steam them while I was cooking the rest of the batch. Maybe a spray bottle next time to steam them while they're cooking. They were nice and brown and didn't seem like I cooked them too long but maybe that's what made them crunchy. I would give this recipe another go.

After trying a few different tortilla recipes on Allrecipes.com and I was a bit disappointed, until I came upon Chef Johns.  They tasted great, had a nice texture, and rolled well for burritos.  Only thing I did different was mixed all ingredients in a food processor.

I love these tortillas!
They are done (including mixing batter, rest, rolling, baking) in no more than 45 minutes. 
It took me 4 tortillas to figure out that greasing the pan is what makes them weird but after I ditched the oil they were perfect.

I made this recipe to a T and they turned out very good.  Easy to roll out--I could even roll paper-thin.  They were fluffy and formed bubbles when I cooked them.  We have a cast iron tortilla pan--but in the past we have only ever used store bought.  Tortillas will be coming off of my shopping list from now on.  I actually cut the last few balls in half again so I could roll them thinner and they'd still fit in the pan.  Thank you Chef John!

Thanks for the recipe! We don't buy shortening - we used stick margarine. Rolled out by hand & cooked on cast iron skillet. These really were fabulous! Saved me a trip to the store and far superior to store-bought!

They where really good, I was sorta trying to find the recipe or something very close to it, for Taco Cabanas tortillas. This dough could be used for pasta, or pizza to, in my opinion. If you don't ad enough butter to this recipe, or veg shorting, I used butter, the tortillas are very hard to roll out.

Delicious, although mine turned out more like chalupas. We really enjoyed these and will make them again. 
I'm only giving the recipe 4 stars because I altered it by using vegan butter instead of shortening. Worked great though!

Easy and awesome. What more can you ask for? I have made these several times now, and it's almost fool proof. Everyone loves them and are very impressed. I do cheat and use butter instead of shortening, I use my kitchenaid for mixing, and a big ole sause pan to fry them up. They rock and go with almost every meal. I HIGHLY recommend these.

These were really easy to make and tasted better than ones bought from the store.  Make sure you don't cook them longer than a minute or you will end up with a hard shell.

I've been searching for a recipe for tortillas that tastes like my grandmas and this is the best and closest one. The tortillas are nice and soft, which is the issue I have with other recipes, the tortillas come out too crispy. I loved how this recipe came out.

In Sri Lanka we call this Rotti made as per John's recipe or with coconut flakes.  If coconut flakes are added to the flour and made this dough it gives a lovely aroma.

Have you ever made a simple recipe that makes you just gush with Proudness once you make it for yourself ?  LOL Well, this recipe ended up being that proudness moment for me. :)  I gave this recipe a try, for I wanted to have an organic recipe without the added Carrageenan ingredient that seems to be found in almost all store bought varieties.  I substituted solid coconut oil for the shortening and made the recipe as stated with great success. This one is a Keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

LOVE this! This is the first time that I've tried to make homemade tortillas, and didn't expect much. Followed the recipe exactly, but didn't watch the video. Overcooked a couple of them, but the taste is great and once I got the hang of it, it was super simple and very tasty!

I give up. This was my second attempt at making homemade tortillas. The last time was ten years ago, so I thought I had more experience in the kitchen this time around and it would be ok. I realized I didn't have any tortillas in the middle of dinner prep and was trying to avoid an unwanted trip to the store. These came out very dry and crispy like if you tried to roll it up like a taco, it would snap in half.  The flavor was good though. So instead of making burritos like I planned, I made a "burrito pie",  laying them flat and layering ingredients. They actually worked fabulously for this as they didn't get soggy.  Dinner was saved and I may use this recipe again if I plan on using  tortillas for the purpose of layering in a casserole-style fashion.

My husband and I just love this recipe for flour tortillas. Actually, we liked them so much the first time we made them that my husband ordered a tortilla press that same night. To make it less laborious, I use a food processor to mix the dry ingredients and butter.  After a few pulses, I transfer the flour back to the bowl. 

I use butter in place of the shortening and use a cast iron skillet to toast them. I top them with the restaurant style taco meat and guacamole that I also found on this site. With the taco meat, guacamole, some sour cream, and cheddar cheese, our tacos are definitely so much better than what we'd get at a Mexican restaurant in our city. Thanks so much!

First attempt and they came out great!  Be sure to observe the rest period.  Fried them in a nonstick skillet. Will never buy in store again!

When in a bind with no store bought tortillas, I knew I had all the ingredients but didn’t want to leave the house.  I followed the recipe(and the video) to a T!  Everything turned out perfectly.  I don’t have a tortilla press but I did use plastic wrap and a rolling pin.  Made them paper thin and it was perfect!  I showed a friend who of Mexican heritage and she said they were perfect as if she taught me.  Gammy was so proud

Simple and tasty. I probably need more practice to make it flexible enough as a wrap. But tasted just as good or better than what I buy at the store, so I did something right.

Probably merits 5 stars. My issues: mot a baker, my first attempt other than biscuits, whixch turn out poorl-not John's recipe. aTortillas: He lsaus use a cast iron skillet, don'tahave one. So, aluminum skillet, electricstove top, heat too high and burdened with the vagaries of electric burners. And no tortilla press. So, very oddly shaped little things. Tasted fine. Some burn spots, my fault. Suggestion John. Try your recipe with an aluminum skillet, regular not heavy lduty. See what hlappens. And I really do like the recipe.j

Made them with lard instead of the shortening, and I adjusted it to end up with 600g of dough.
Ended up with 12 lovely, 9 inch tortillas. This recipe has the best ratios of salt, fat and flour that I've made!
Highly recommend!

I followed the recipe exactly, but only 1-2 of my tortillas puffed up, and they all were very dense and not as light and airy as I had hoped.  I'm going to try it again and see if I can better results.

Very tasty. I would cut dough in 6 sections instead of 8 for a 6" tortilla press.  These came out a bit small.  I would also add a bit more baking soda as ours did not "bubble up" .  

Chef John's videos are so helpful.

I made these for dinner tonight and they are delicious.  I used lard instead of vegetable shortening.  The recipe is easy to follow and the video is helpful so I recommend watching that first.  My boyfriend says they're better than the store-bought raw ones we've been buying and cooking at home.

I hit enter key too soon. I made this earlier. One problem is they’re kinda small. So I made 4 medium (almost large) tortillas. Next time I’ll double recipe to make more tortillas. Taste so awesome!

Delicious, thanks chef!
  Living in Arizona I'm used to authentic tortillas from restaurants that make there own. Store bought aren't just less fresh, they are also different . Putting your dish on store bought tortillas is like putting a new Corvette on old, cheap dry tires.
  I like this recipe but I use lard instead of vegetable shortening (Believe it or not lard is so much healthier, the research is all over the place, check the facts).
  Oh and I learned the hard way, make them thin, thin, thin! I place the dough between one side of a gallon ziplock storage bag and a piece of aluminum foil. Then use a large soup pot to do the initial press and then a granite roller.This allows for a thinner tortilla than a tortilla press. I place the tortilla in the pan with the foil still stuck to it, when the tortilla is ready to flip, it will release the foil allowing you to peal it away easily.
  Make them a tiny bit thicker and you have the base for a very fast and easy flatbread pizza that everyone loves.

Delicious! I halved the recipe, and eyeballed the salt, baking powder, and shortening. Makes a delicious cracker! Yet the ones I rolled out thicker had the Mission brand thickness, aka were foldable, aka were a tortilla (yay). Btw a tortilla press is absolutely a necessity if you eat tortillas regularly, or some makeshift tortilla press. The rolling pin produces a lame tortilla.

Tastes great the way it's written.  Prefer to roll them out thin rather than use a press.  These have an almost buttery flavor to them that's a hit in our household.

When I cooked them as long as the recipe calls for the tortillas were over cooked and crispy, like quesadillas without the cheese. I shortened the cook time to 1 minute total (30 seconds each side) and they were perfect. Great flavor and texture with time adjustment.

Best tortilla recipe we have tried! Most recipes, the tortilla is thick and more like flat bread, this is the first we have tried that it is genuinely like a tortilla. A keeper for sure!

Yummmmm!!! I loved these! I followed the directions exactly and they turned out wonderful. I did not have a press, but plan on investing in one soon. These were incredibly easy and remind me of ones that were made for me as a kid. Make sure when you take them out of the skillet that you place them in something to keep them warm. Delicious! Thanks Chef John......another winner!

they taste wonderful! when you roll out the dough i had no idea how thin to roll it and ended up making the first half  to thick. i also had no vegetable shortening, so i mixed vegetable oil in when i mixed in the hot water, it worked out great!

I wanted to make tortillas and thought I had my usual tortilla flour, but when I checked the pantry I was out. I decided to try a recipe that used all-purpose flour instead. This recipe was perfect! They turned out even better than usual. This will definitely be how I make them from now on.

Great recipe! I grew up on flour tortillas in New Mexico and the texture and flavor of these are right on. My only substitution based on other reviews is I used 3 Tbls on room temperature coconut oil. After resting 20 minutes they were a breeze to roll out and work with. Thanks Chef Ron.

I just used applesauce in place of fat and we loved them.  I can see us using these instead of buying them.  They are very delicious and very easy.  Another winner for healthier  and easier meals.

I did not have shortening so I used margarine.  They came out perfect.  I will probably cut into 6 instead of 8 next time as I like a slightly larger tortilla. They are easier to make than I thought.  Will never go back to store bought.  Delicious.

I made these with gluten free flour. I had to use a little more water than the recipe calls for, and I don't knead dough in which I use my GF flour. My husband, who can eat whatever he wants, loves these even though they are GF. (It is my goal, in my culinary adventures, to not just make GF taste "as good as," but "better than" glutinous versions of recipes.)

These are a quick, wonderful version that I can easily make in whichever flour I desire, and I really like these!!

These were great and were gone in an instant the only thing is make sure that you role the dough REALLY thin or else it most likely won't cook properly another thing that i have to say is that these tortillias don't fold very well for burritos or soft tacos

I don't put a full 1/4 cup of shortening. If you like them less gummy and more flakey don't full the 1/4 cup. No need to change anything else. Great recipe. Fav by far.

First time making homemade tortillas :) We loved these!  I agree with those who said to cook on medium and they seriously do not take long at all (seconds per side).  Mine came out full of bubble pockets and were delicious. I should have made a double batch.  Thanks Chef John

I've made these before and they are delightful. Today, I splurged on a tortilla press and made a batch of gluten free tortillas. Beyond trying to get the right consistency with the gf dough to make them thin enough, they were beautiful. My husband ate one without knowing it was gf and said how nice it was. I'll keep working on trying to make them thinner without falling apart. As always, thanks Chef John for your wonderful recipes.

This recipe is so easy to make.  I did not have a tortilla press, so I used a rolling pin.  It worked just as well.  My family devours these before they even hit the table.  Thanks Chef John for the recipe!

Followed recipe, except  I used  butter  instead  of  shortening.  I boiled the water to make sure it was hot enough. Used a dry (no cooking oil) nonstick  pan over medium high heat. Don't  have  a  tortilla  press.  I rolled  dough  out  by hand using a heavy jar.  I placed  dough in between   two plastic  bread bags beforehand  so dough wouldn't  stick  to my jar while rolling.  Came out  perfect.  Must  watch  closely or they'll burn.  Doesn't  take  long  to  cook.  Tastes amazing. Looked like the  finished  product  in  the  video .  Hubby and  kids  ate them all and wanted  more.  Don't  expect  these  to be like store bought.  They're  not  as pliable, but more like a flat bread.  But, they taste so much better.  I will be making these often.


******Update******Made these again.  After taking them out of the pan, I placed  them  on  a  plate  and covered  it with  a  lid from  one  of  my pots.  They  remained  covered for about 20 minutes, while I did other things.  When  I  removed  the  lid, I  was  pleasantly  surprised.  They  were  still  warm, but  VERY  bendable and even more soft.  I could use them like burritos or wraps.  I love them even more now!

Simply perfect. Tried several recipes, none of them was this great. I use butter instead of shortening.  The first one sometimes comes out hard, because the pan is not hot enough then. So it's totally my fault. But all the rest is heavenly soft and yummy.

This is the recipe I use all the time.  Perfect measurements for a perfect taco.  I do add just a little bit of lime juice to the water (about a tbsp) to flavor it just a little.

My first three tortillas were small and kind of gummy.  I made them using my tortilla press (probably using it wrong, as they weren't as thin as I needed!) The next few I made using my rolling pin, rolled them nice and thin and they cooked in my cast iron skill on med-high, just perfect! I made another batch, which also turned out perfect.  I used lard instead of shortening (not bacon grease) bought from a Mexican butcher.  (local store in Columbus, OH) Not sure why some thought low heat was the way to go, since I have a commercial range that gets very hot.

I've tried another recipe for tortillas before and I wasn't too impressed with the outcome so I decided to give it another try and followed this recipe to the letter, and they  turned out perfectly! They're soft, flexible and so buttery tasting. I made tacos and burritos with these and they really are so so so so much better than any store bought tortillas, and I love store bought tortillas. I'll definitely use this in the future!

Double batch to make 16! Of the yummy goodnesses. Butter flavored Crisco. REALLY hot water. Don't have a pastry cutter. Usually use a potato masher. Pressed between pie plates then rolled out paper thin. On a dry griddle of 250°. Wowzers. No one likes store bought anymore.  yea! BTW, wonderful video. Totally relaxing and to the point. The only reason I felt like making them. Should have been doing this for years! Now better than never. Thank you Mr. Chef John.

I will definitely make these again. I tried them because I only had 1/4 t of baking powder left. I followed the directions exactly and had no issues at all! I prepared each taco in the pan after I flipped the tortilla, folded it over and placed it in a casserole dish with a lid covering it, but not actually closed. This way I didn't have to worry if the tortilla would crack or not after it cooled.

I have tried it and my daughter (which eats to many tortillas and cheese to me) just loves them also. Chef John is so easy to follow for me and I have tried a lot of his recipes (for my bringing up, the ones that aren't what I consider fancy) and they are great (to me). Now I need him to have for me recipes of foods my mom use to make and I never got the recipes for and can't seem to find. I love it, when I'm not thinking straight, his videos take me right through it like a breeze. Thank You Chef John, keep it coming.

I've made these a few times and there isn't a consistency, but probably due to me rather than the recipe.  Not exactly what I was expecting, but they weren't bad.  My kids liked them a lot, I just thought they were alright.

Had the texture of Naan and was gummy. I made exactly as is and each tortilla was about 8" diameter. Will try again just in case it was my fault but I've made several tortilla recipes before.

Tried these this morning with poor results.  I believe the problem is that the pan was too hot.  I got lovely big bubbles, but they burned way before 1 minute.  They came out like Naan bread, not tortillas. I tried cooking them for less time, flipping them several times...no good. The last few I lowered the heat to Low, and they came out way better.  They really need to be cooked on low heat and only until they're golden.  I will try again.

I could not have been more pleased with the outcome of these tortillas.  I didn't want to make a run to the store for our breakfast tacos and have been meaning to try this for a while but was a little hesitant.  This recipe is so easy and the tortillas are so good!  I don't think my family is going to be satisfied with storebought any more.  I used butter instead of shortening or lard and just rolled them out with my rolling pin.  I used a cast iron gridle with no oil and thy cooked just like the video.

This recipe is good, but the cooking time/temp is off. I made dough, and rolled out with a rolling pin (it's really not that bad guys, although I with there was some recommended thickness) and when I put it in the pan (cast iron skillet) it almost immediately smelled of burning flour. I ended up turning the burner to LOW, and following the one min, flip, one min, flip, on min, take out timing. The tortillas put in the pan on med. hi. were burned and very brittle. It could just be that my burner is hotter than his, but I don't think that it would be THAT MUCH of a difference. I will make these again, but on LOW heat.

Couldn't wait to try my hand at homemade tortillas when I saw Chef John's recipe. I followed the directions as stated and rolling these out to the size of a small tortilla was a challenge, the dough kept wanting to shrink on me. They ended up very thin and after being cooked in my cast iron skillet (I only cooked about 30 seconds on each side) they seemed kind of on the dry side and cracked when rolling into taco shape (used for fish tacos). I may try this again and make into 6 tortillas instead.

I literally just finished making a batch.  Wow, I didn't realize how easy it is to make home make these, and good too.  Only thing I did different was cook these on a medium-low heat, my first one got a little brown on medium-high, it just takes a few seconds longer on medium-low.  Will definitely make these again.

I have tried a few different recipes,none of them tasted as flavorful as these.(I know it's flour,shortening,water etc. What could go Wrong? All I know is this recipe is a Keeoer! I served it to my family,friends,guests all with rave reviews. I've made many varieties,even fried them. I used fish,pork,beef,vegetarian,tri-colored beans,retried beans etc. These are so versatile I'm gonna keep on inventing different varieties..... how does roast beef,pickled radishes,tomatillos & an Avacado/horseradish sauce sound?

Might need a press to make them thin enough and foldable. Good, but thick and not foldable.  Update: floured 2 flexible cutting boards and used rolling pin to flatten.  Was bummed we halved the recipe and only made 4.

Five stars here.  I made them as written except used lard since I happened to have some left from another project.  I think the rest time is important to give the flour time to incorporate the liquid to it, so don't skip that.  I was able to roll them out with a rolling pin very easily.  I used my cast iron griddle to make them.  I lined the raw tortillas on a sheet of parchment until I rolled them all to cook them.  This was my first time to make my own tortillas, so I am a proud new tortilla maker!  Thanks, Chef! Again.

Very good.  Very easy to make.  I've never made homemade tortillas before.  Very easy to roll out.  I'd make them bigger next time.  Maybe cut recipe into 4 tortillas instead of 8.

These were so easy to make and come out perfect. The dough was easy to roll and did not stretch back like other recipes i tried. The only change i made was that I used lard instead of shortening. My hubby loves these and wants me to make these everyday now, haha! These are also pliable! I was able to easily fold these into burritos. Tip: if folding into burrito, do it right away otherwise they will get drier the longer they sit and can break. I had mine covered in a kitchen towel and waited about an hour before serving. They are so much better fresh off the stove.

I can't imagine someone not liking these. So easy. I make a quadruple batch and freeze them. I then make a variety of fillings, from a Thai-influenced chicken one that I make up as I go, to a shredded goat taco, to a veggie chili-like dish. Makes for easy dinners when I'm too tired to cook. Thanks for a great recipe! Living in rural Haiti, and for over 12 years I only ate local food (rice daily with some beans and occasionally some pork). Got tired of it, bought a solar powered (batteries) freezer, and loving the time in the kitchen. Heavy cooking every Saturday afternoon. Mesi anvil!

I never thought making homemade tortillas would be so simple! They were perfect and yummy. So easy and delicious that I'm planning to buy a press just to cut down the time. Love!

This is the first time I made tortilla. Never imagine I could make my own and it's delicious. I don't have shortening in my kitchen so I substitute with butter. I used non stick skillet and flip the tortilla often for every 2 seconds to make it puffy. I eat my broiled fish topped with roasted tomato wrapped in tortilla for lunch. Yummy! Thanks Chef John for this great recipe.

Another great recipe from Chef John! 

These were so delicious and so easy. I used my Kitchenaid stand mixer and rolled them out. Let the dough rest for a while and they'll be really to roll. Everyone's right in that we'll never go back to store-bought again. Thanks for the great recipe.

Yum-o. Tasted great. But unless you have a tortilla press you might want to double the recipe. They are pretty hard to make super thin and the size you'd want.

Great Recipe! I had never made Tortillas before and was a little worried that it wouldn't turn out at all...but it tuned out amazing and didn't take long at all. Followed the recipe exactly and rolled them out with a rolling pin. The first batch was a touch too thick for our liking but they tasted great. The following day I made them again, this time doubling the recipe and making large shells for Tacos. I rolled them out and then stretched them a little more by hand until I was able to see through them. They turned out much better than store bought ones. They were stronger and tasted much better. Will be using this recipe from now on!

Great recipe! This is the traditional way my mother makes it.  For a gluten free version, can I replace the all purpose flour for brown rice flour?

This is the recipe I've been looking for!  This is as close to the Guerrero tortillas that my family loves from the grocery as I can get.  For more authentic flavor, I used tortilla flour and lard as the fat.  Something important you should note, the quantity of dough in this recipe makes eight 8 inch round tortillas.  So if you are looking for a 12" burrito size you will want to double it.  This is the first recipe that I have tried that I was able to roll the tortillas out as thin as they needed to be in order to cook properly and be flexible and also the only one that they didn't tear when I lifted them to toss in the pan.  I have also learned trying all these different recipes that the longer you let them rest, the bigger you can roll them. I roll them out on a piece of parchment paper so that I don't need to add any extra flour which can ruin the taste when the flour scorches in the pan. They come out perfect every time, the only problem I have is how fast they disappear!

I have made these three different ways: first, as the recipe is written; second, using vegetable oil instead of the shortening; and lastly, using butter. All had favoruable results. The best way was with butter as they were the softest with the most flavour. After cooking they keep well before serving in a warmed corning ware dish with lid.

Delicious. Burnt the first couple as the skillet was a little too hot but turned down to medium and they came out fluffy, easy to roll and perfect for carne asada and mexican rice and beans.

These were great! Followed the recipe exactly and they were nice and puffy and chewy. I rolled them really thin and they held up super well! Really good reheated too. I sometimes make a really big batch and freeze them. Then pull out what you want, and microwave in a wet paper towel for a few seconds (maybe 110-15 seconds per tortilla).

Really easy to make and very tasty. I doubled the recipe, and there was not even a crumb left after our meal! 

I also went one step further and put them in the oven to crisp up and use as Taco shells and they worked a real treat....

These were good!  I think I overworked my dough some because I had a lot of trouble to get them to flatten, but I made it work.  Used this for just plain ol' tacos!

I have no idea what happened - but I did not get a "ball" of dough, I got a bowl of crumbs.  I had to add 1.5 cups of hot water and 1/2 cup of shortening to get anything like a ball of dough.

I tried two different tortilla recipes from this site - this one and "homemade flour tortillas" posted by LaDonna. Chef John has best tasting recipe by far. They do have a lot more vegetable shortening than the other recipe though, so I might cut it back a tiny bit next time I make them. They rolled out nicely, cooked well (be aware the skillet needs to be quite hot) and had lots of nice air pockets and bubbles. They seem to be a bit smaller than 8 inches though, perhaps I need to roll it thinner next time. Overall highly recommend. On the bad side, eating a lot of these is a recipe for weight gain.

In South Africa tortillas are ridiculously expensive. 

This was cheap, easy and it tasted 100 times better than any supermarket version.

I attempted the recipe using organic butter and while the tortillas still tasted decent, they did not bubble as well as the ones shown in the video. Maybe I'll try Crisco next go around.

Super excited to make tortillas, but it didn't turn out too well. I don't know if I did something wrong, but they were very crispy. Was hoping to use it for a burrito wrap, but it crumbled. I followed the video and instructions exactly, so have no idea what went wrong. The only thing that I can think is that mine were thinner; the Chef's looked kinda thick.

We love this... I end up making these every couple of days. I found that I end up using more solid shortening as mine is very soft at room temperature.  I like cooking them on a non-stick surface as my steel fry pan gets left with black marks. I also roll them very very thin. They are light, layered, and very nummy.

I tryed making tortillas on an electric tortilla maker with their recipe. Did not turn out right. Okay but not great. These were much better. I used my electric maker for a press and used a skillet to cook tortillas. At first I couldn't get them to puff up. I turned the heat and that did.. Hope this helps Thanks for the recipe....
