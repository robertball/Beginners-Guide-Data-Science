This was good. I tried it because my favorite cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory is their Kahlua one. It didn't compare but all my guests really loved it. Make sure you get REALLY good chocolate.

hit of the party! this cheesecake is really rich a small slice is enough. the cheesecake itself is great but the added chocolate/ kahlua on top was awsome. only two change made (by accident) did not use the recipes crumb crust. Made my own with chocolate gram crackers. Which i think made it even better. Did not top the cake with the whipping cream because i over mixed the whipping cream. I had to use Cool whip to top each slice when serving. Still its about the cheesecake filling and that was great.

Have been making cheesecakes for 20 years and was excited when I saw the Kahlua recipe. Tried a Kahlua cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory and loved it but am very disappoinged in this one.   I followed the directions carefully, but the cake would not get done. It fook almost two hours to get it soft in the center.   Of all  the cakes I have fixed I have never fixed one at such a low temperature. Could that be the problem?  And no there is nothing wrong with my oven. Fixed a different one later and no problems with it.
