We loved this.  I used only 2 T. sugar and  doubled the soy sauce and the garlic because I had a bit more than a pound of chicken. Kept the other ingredients as written. I served this over fried noodles.  To make the noodles I used 8 oz of cooked angel hair rough chopped into a hot pan with 1/4 cup butter and. 2 T peanut oil. Sprinkle with 2 chopped green onions and garlic salt.  Fry until golden. Mix with steamed broccoli.  Serve serve the bulgogi over top of the noodle. 5 stars. Chicken had AMAZING FLAVOR. Nice and spicy.

I've been making this every since the recipe was published.  It's so easy to toss together for a last minute meal idea. No changes necessary. It's perfect!  Bulgogi means thinly sliced meat.  I like mine cut to the point that it's almost shaved.  Toss in a hot skillet and it's done in under 5 minutes. To serve, we like it best over sesame noodles or even a plain Ramen style noodle. Add a mix of stir-fried veggies like broccoli, carrots, and cabbage and you have a complete all-in-one meal.

I've made this twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and I kept thinking something was missing.  The second time I added about a tbs of minced ginger.  Is it authenttic?  Who cares -  it's delicious and fairly quick to make a nutritious diner.  Thanks, Daveparks4!

We thought this was extremely tasty, though it didn't really taste much like bulgogi to me due to not being cooked on an open flame. It was still extremely delicious. I wound up finishing mine on a sheet pan in the oven so I could broil it to crisp up the skin a bit, and also bc it was sort of stewing in my 12-inch skillet. I think in the future I'd just broil it right from the get-go, the internet is full of instructions on how to do that if you're curious to try that route. Thanks for sharing your recipe! Served with rice on lettuce cups to make it remind us even further of bulgogi :)

Skillet Chicken Bulgogi Haiku: "Quick and flavorful. But was done much more quickly. (Ate mine in lettuce.)" On med-hi heat w/ the chicken cut into thin slices, they would've been obliterated to dry slivers in 15 min. - more like a stir-fry at that temperature, my chicken was done in more like 5 min. I put the marinade into a ziploc bag w/ the chicken about 2 hrs. b4 preparing it for myself for lunch (reduced ingredients to 2 servings and ate in lettuce leaves) and followed everything else as written. Surprisingly tasty -

Loved it!!!  Doubled the amount of onion ( scallions).  Don't add any extra salt, the soy sauce has enough.  The key thing I do is to saute until all the liquid is gone and everything has more or less caramelized. It's amazing this way!  I served it over a couple packages of ramen noodles cooked with a chicken bullion cube and some frozen peas.  Also made an Asian slaw salad with mandarin oranges and  browned almonds in it.  Everything accidentally got mixed together on the plate, and boy, was that good!  This is definitely going on our frequent flyer list.  When my brother-in-law had it recently, he couldn't stop raving about it.  Said he wanted it for his next birthday dinner!

This was delicious. I used it on cubed pork and the only alteration I did was reduce the cayenne by half. Once you try it, you'll keep eating it until you literally can't lift your fork anymore.

Fantastic dish with a depth of flavor. I didn't serve this over rice so I added about a teaspoon of corn starch to thicken it a bit. Otherwise there were no changes. This is definitely going into the regular dinner rotation.

This was quick and easy and delicious. I left out the cayenne pepper and added a dash of Chinese 5 spice to the sauce. I caramelized onion and added some carrots and served over noodles. It passed the picky eater test, so it will go into rotation at our house.

Nice flavor to this simple dish.  I followed the recipe but made a mistake with 1/2 TBSP of cayenne instead of 1/2 tsp. My bad.  Still, although hot it was flavorful. Will make again, this time with mushrooms and snow peas and the correct amount of cayenne.  Oh, and I pre-soaked rice noodles in cold water for two hours then added them to the chicken/marinade for the last 8 minutes of cook time.  They really soaked up the flavor (and all the excess liquid in the pan)!

I thought it was delicious and the only thing I did differently was add some cornstarch for more of a saucy consistency.  Has a really good flavor but might try as another reader did and add fresh ginger next time, we'll see. Maybe just a little.

What a great and easy dinner for a weeknight.  Goes together easily and quickly and you can customize it at will.  We love to add veggies and serve it over spaghetti.  The sauce is wonderful, we double it when making it.

This was so good.  Definitely a keeper.  Added some ginger as some recommended and halved the cayenne.  Didn't have sesame seed oil so used olive.  No leftovers after seconds.  Served over Ramon noodles for a twist.

Made this recipe with pork tenderloin, served it with rice and Napa cabbage.  Quick and easy prep and clean up. The whole family loved it. Great balance of sweetness and spice. We will be adding it into our monthly meal rotation.

Good, very good even, but I personally diluted the marinate with water to make it less salty and added some chopped green onions at the end.  I also think it's missing a little something, I'm going to try adding 2-3 tsp of minced ginger to add a little kick next time.

I also used more onions than were listed.  1/2 of an onion, sliced, but think that 1/4 of an onion would probably work better for most people.

Great mix of flavors. It's got enough heat to make it interesting and enough sweet to offset that. This is a good, lean fix for helping me lose weight. I use a variety of veggies including riced cauliflower, diced zucchini, onions and red peppers for instance added to 1/2 c of rice to fill out the dish. I use chicken tenders rather than an entire breast and that extends the meal as well. This is a definite favorite of all our family including picky eaters.

This is a good recipe and my picky kids like it too. I added ground ginger (about a tbsp) and zucchini and I think that was a good choice. I doubled the sauce and let the chicken and veggies marinated for 10 minutes before cooking. Next time I will try to let it marinade for at least an hour and I think that would kick it up a notch. The dish is good but I feel like it was missing something I canâ€™t quite put my finger on. Oh and I did thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry because the zucchini watered it down some.

I left out the cayenne pepper, but made everything else according to the recipe. My family loved it so much they were arguing over who could get seconds.  Plan on trying with pork and beef, but will definitely have to double the recipe!

This was a very quick and tasty dish! I made it according to the directions and it turned out lovely. This time I put it over rice, but I also think it would be fantastic over chow mein. Will definitely make again.!

Definitely a keeper! Love the versatility and I think this was the first time I've been able to make a meal w/o going to the store for at least one key ingredient.  Everything is a pantry staple and I was able to add veggies that I already had on hand.  Rave family reviews!

Was pretty easy to prepare.  My son even ate it and a friend's two year old actually ate the carrots prepared like that (hasn't been eating them).  I only added carrots and mushrooms since that was what I had on hand.  Nice to have a recipe that doesn't require too many ingredients.

Very good! My kids thought it was too spicy but still said it was delicious and asked that I make it again but less spicy next time. I think I will try half the suggested cayenne pepper. I myself liked the amount of spicyness and I am not a really spicy kinda person. I also added  snap peas and carrot slices and covered it while the veggies were cooling. Left lots of sauce that way so I thickened with a bit of corn starch. Would do the same next time.

I got 99% of the ingredients for this recipe, everything except for the sesame oil.  I used just a little olive oil and doubled the recipe.  I made 4 cups of white rice, added some shredded cabbage and green onions.  Everyone loved it and I should have tripled the recipe.

Great dish! Once the chicken was done there was enough sauce to stir in some extra onions, carrots, and green beans. Also added a little extra cayenne for an additional kick.

I doubled the chicken and sliced it into thin pieces. I also doubled the soy sauce, omitted the salt and black pepper, and cut the Cayenne pepper in half. It was still pretty spicy, but very good. Served with steamed carrots and broccoli over rice.
12/4/17 I used 1.5lbs chicken. Made as directed, but added a few more tbsp soy sauce. It was pretty spicy. I also diced carrots and celery and cooked it with chicken. To thicken sauce, I added 2 tbsp corn starch (mixed with cold water first) served over plain ramen noodles.

Really good flavored dish.  I made it as is.  My husband raved about it.  Served over Jasmine rice with Broccoli.

Very tasty! I doubled the sauce to have a little extra since I stir fried some onions and mushrooms to add to the chicken. Also used a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce. We had with jasmine rice and enjoyed very much. Thanks!

Added slightly more onion/brown sugar because I'm a sucker for both.  WOW.  Kudos a million times over to the individual who posted this recipe.  First time trying a Korean dish, and it is instantly a favorite with my wife and I.  Served over brown rice noodles boiled (as opposed to friend).  Feels super clean, perfect amount of kick and incredibly flavorful.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really good. It was easy to make. I'm sure I didn't do everything just right since I added the broccoli, bell pepper and carrots to the marinade so it doesn't look like the picture but the taste was yummy! Will make again and have the veggies on the side.

This is good.  My family ate it without complaint and it was a quick week night dinner. I stir fried a mix of veg I had on hand as my first step, removed those to a bowl, then re-used the pan for the cooking of the meat and sauce mix (which I added thinly sliced carrots as the broiling cooks those to perfection). I did add 1 tsp cornstarch in a broth slurry and could have added 2 tsp. I cooked low and slow as I had the time and served with Jasmine rice.

This was very good!  I made it with elk steak.  I made a few changes.  I cut the soy sauce to 3 tablespoons, added ginger,  sliced cabbage, and siracha.  Served it over brown rice.  So yummy!!

Wow, this was delicious! And so easy to make! It is quite spicey, which suited me fine, but next time I'll have to cut back on the cayenne for my family (who also loved this, but it was just a bit too much heat for them). I served it over stir fry noodles. This one is a keeper for sure!

This recipe is a keeper! I served it over angel hair pasta and my teenage son couldn't stop talking about how good it is. I pretty much stayed true to the original recipe except I doubled the sauce and added in shredded carrots. I thickened the sauce with a little corn starch as one of the readers suggested. This would be good with broccoli, peas, tofu, the options are endless.

Needs a bit more sesame oil and I added about 3 table spoons of white vinegar when frying.

Also added shredded carrots and green beans. 

SO GOOD. Great for mass meal prep.

OMG I will be making this again. I was stationed in South Korea and haven't been able to find any good recipes that come close to being authentic. Until I found this one. I did add some ingredients. A tablespoon of sriracha and a teaspoon of ginger. Sriracha definitely added the spice it was missing.

This was good but came out too salty even though I used reduced salt soy sauce. I marinated the chicken in the sauce for about 45 minutes. I added some mushrooms, snow peas, red onion and red pepper to make it a complete meal and served it with rice.

I followed this recipe as far as ingredients goes but I used 1.5 lbs. chicken as I had a bigger number that evening and therefore increased other ingredients accordingly. The recipe was easy....I marinated for approximately 4 hours and served with Jasmine Rice. The only ingredient I left out was the sesame seeds as I did not think they would go over well with my granddaughters. One granddaughter liked it and the other wasn't hungry that evening.  I do not like Jasmine Rice....I'd prefer to stick with Basmati Rice. I may make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed this recipe to a T except for I didn't have cayenne pepper so had to omit that :( This turned out so good, will definitely be making more. It is such a versatile recipe - it can go with anything - on top of noodles, plain rice, etc. And it's also EASY!!! Will have to get cayenne pepper next time I make it!

I made this exactly as written and it was delightful! Beautiful, simple marinade that is extremely versatile.  You could make this with any meat you have on hand or whatever's on sale.  Or, cut the meat and make it vegetarian with mushrooms and veggies if you like.  The only change I will make next time is to double it because I want more!

I seldom follow a recipe exactly, nor did I here. I doubled the marinade and added steamed broccoli at the end. I also added a little corn starch and water to thicken the sauce a bit. That said, my husband and I loved this! This sauce could be used in so many ways! My only thing I'd change would be to cut WAY back on the cayenne, but then I'm not one for spicy food. We will definitely be having this again and experimenting with different vegetables to use with it!

I made this for my wife, who usually does all the cooking. It was her birthday, so I wanted to make her dinner for a change. It was very easy to make, and Everyone loved it!! I only used half of the sesame oil and cayenne pepper (mainly because my wife and son do not like spicy foods).  I did also add a little bit of ground ginger, and added some stir fry vegetables at the end.  I served them over rice noodles for an all in one meal that I will be sure to make again

Super fast and really great. My only gripe was the lack of veggies, so I loaded mine up with carrots, celery, and red bell pepper. Served in lettuce cups and devoured as quickly as it was cooked.

Wonderful flavor, even though I ran out of sesame seed and oil! The only thing I might change is reducing the amount of soy sauce a little. It was just a tad too salty, and I used reduce sodium Tamari. Ultimately, the dish tasted great and was very easy to make.

This dish is the bomb.  Love how easy it is and the flavors are right on the mark. The only thing I did different was to double the  recipe and I'm glad I did, it went fast. This is a keeper.

I marinated the chicken and cooked a serving each night. I served it over broccoli slaw and shredded carrots, delicious!

Loved it.  Used chicken tenders instead of breasts to ensure they wouldn't get dry or tough.
