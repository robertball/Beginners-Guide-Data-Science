This soup sounded so good and so easy, I was really excited to try it. But the taste was disappointing. I only added 4 cups of water instead of 6 cups, but it really diluted the flavor of the tomato sauce. I added some dried herbs, spices, and lots of salt to make it taste better, but I wouldn't make this recipe again.

There just wasn't much to this soup.  I didn't puree the onion and (extra) garlic because I wanted texture in the soup. Sadly there was no helping the flavor. I tried to doctor it up with chopped peeled and seeded tomato, shredded carrot and some herbs and spices...but it was no use.  I had even used all chicken stock and no water, knowing water is flavorless.  Too blah for me, sorry.
