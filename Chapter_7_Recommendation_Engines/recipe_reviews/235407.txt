Quick & Easy Black Beans & Rice Haiku: "Added smoked sausage. Used fresh cilantro, not dried. Rest I kept the same." I was skeptical of the seemingly strange combo of Cajun seasoning, cumin and cilantro, but somehow this all came together in a really delicious way! To make it an entree, I crisped 1 lb. sliced smoked sauce w/ the onion and garlic, and while the recipe didn't say to drain and rinse the black beans, I did so anyways, and sprinkled w/ fresh chopped cilantro (couple TB's worth) since I don't keep dry on hand. It WAS quick and easy, and better than that, 5 stars from the entire family, and no leftovers!

Thanks so much for this recipe! I've been on this site for 10+ years and never reviewed a recipe, but since this one had so few reviews and was so good, I thought I'd throw in my $0.02. ;) I had to make a few slight modifications to use what I had on hand, but it was the same basic idea and worked out perfectly! The only onion I had was a small bag of Birdseye frozen chopped onions, so used half a bag for the onion (no need to thaw). I also used minced garlic from a jar (approx 3 tsp). I didn't have Creole seasoning, so used 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1/4+ tsp seasoned salt instead and omitted the cilantro since I didn't have any on hand (I'm sure it would add great flavor, though!). I used Bush's seasoned recipe canned black beans drained, but not rinsed (those are my favorite) and substituted 2 cups of chicken broth for the water and bouillon cube. I cooked it just how the recipe states with the exception of adding all the seasonings before simmering and simmering for approx 45-50 minutes because I used brown rice. It was so easy and tasted fantastic! My VERY picky two year-old loved it and my husband insisted that it go in our regular rotation! Thanks again! ;)

this took nearly an hour to cook.. we usually put the water and rice in the pot, bring that to a boil, put a lid on it and simmer on low for 20 min's.. the difference here was that everything was boiled first and then the rice was put in.. i'm guessing that's why it took so long, but i could be wrong (??) i added in some leftover Slow Cooker Pernil Pork from this site to make it more of a main dish for bf's lunch.. the flavor is really good, but i don't think it was worth the wait.. bf said if we were to try this again we'd just do it our way, putting everything in including the rice and bringing it to a boil

This is a fantastic side dish to any Mexican or Latin meal. I make this in my electric skillet. For the creole seasoning I use the Creole Seasoning Blend recipe from this site. Wonderful.

I made this just as directed! Actually... I didn't have creole seasoning so I subbed adobo. My family loves it. I make it when we have tacos for dinner and when there is some leftover in the fridge, people actually eat it the next day!

I tripled the recipe, but instead of adding the required amount of water, I used 2 cups less. I added 2 oz of tomato sauce instead. I included all of the ingredients except beef bouillon and creole seasoning. I added a pinch of salt instead. would use less cumin next time, 1/2 the amount. I used fresh cilantro which works just the same. This is a great recipe I plan to repeat frequently.

I added french onion soup mix to the water along with better than bouillon. Instead of three cloves I used a hefty scoop of chopped garlic from a jar and a heavy dash of smoked paprika

Great recipe. I added 1Tbs Nutritional Yeast instead of Creole Seasoning (didn't have any) and it soaked up the little liquid remaining. also I added about 1Tbs fresh lime juice and fresh cilantro at the end. my 10 year old loved it! Thanks for Dinner!

Quick and Easy black beans and Rice. Needed a quick and easy meal on a budget while missing my moms Cuban congri, I followed the instructions with two minor changes. I cooked smoked beef and turkey sausage in the hot olive oil for about 5mins then added the white small chopped onion and garlic clovers. I skipped the Creole at the end, due to the sausage already adding a bit of sodium (salt) into the flavor of the dish.

I had a can of black beans leftover from the last time I made chili, needed an easy dinner, and thought I'd give this recipe a try.  I added andouille sausage during the garlic-and-onions phase to make it an entree and it was great!  Easy to put together without a trip to the grocery, and enough leftover to have it again. To save time, I added the rice to the pan with everything else before bringing it to a boil. I had to leave out the cilantro, as I didn't have any on hand.
  I will definitely be making this again, though I may plan ahead for it next time and add some bell peppers for color.

This was so easy to make, and the results are delicious! I recently went vegan, so I just used vegetable broth instead of the beef cube, and it was still full of flavor and amazing! Going into the weekly rotation...

I made this in a last minute effort to have a side with tacos.I didn't have regular long grain rice so I used Jasmine rice which I had on hand.    I didn't drain the beans, as that wasn't in the directions and then after reading the reviews I saw that some people substitued part of the water for the bean juice so I threw in another handful of rice hoping to help with the extra liquid.  I did not have creole seasoning so I added a packet of Goya Sazon that I had on hand.  It could have used a little more spice but all and all it was delicious and perfectly cooked.

I didn't have cumin, creole, or cilantro so I left them out and didn't replace them. The dish tasted amazing even without all that stuff! I'm so happy with it and will definitely be repeating this recipe!

Made as directed, except I used kidney beans instead of black beans.  Flavor was a little bland when I tried it right out of the pan, so I added another 1/2 tsp of Cajun seasoning.  Not out of this world, but I think it's good enough that it will probably become a work-lunch staple.

I made this. Currently still waiting for rice to get tender. It's been cooking now for over 30 minutes. Next time I will cook rice separate then mix together. Maybe the writer meant to use minute rice?

I left out the cumin, because I didn't want that flavor to limit what I could pair this with.  Very tasty recipe.

For me it just lacked flavor. Rice is plain, beans are plain. Overall it was easy, and cooking time was faster than expected.

This was delicious & super easy, I made it a little faster by not sautéing the onion & garlic I used dehydrated minced onion & garlic, not garlic powder! I replaced 1/2 a cup of the water with the bean juice from the can, just pour it from can into measuring cup & use the other 1 1/2 cups water. Fresh cilantro & some chopped scallion/green onion at the end when it's cooked was the perfect combo. Would recommend this to anyone!

Boring and bland. I would have to make some changes if I tried it again. Maybe brand of creole seasoning matters?

Too under seasoned for me.  Good basic recipe. I used boil in bag basmati rice, and doubled seasoning, added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes.  Husband loved it.

This is a delicious recipe! I make it as is without any changes. When I was looking for a recipe for black beans and rice I almost skipped over this one because of the blah name it is given and because there weren't many reviews. Once I checked out the ingredients, though, I had a feeling it would be delicious and I was RIGHT! In fact, I'm making it again right now to eat with our fish tacos tonight. Yum!

This was very easy and tasty.  Like others I used brown rice and drained, but not rinsed black beans.  I had leftover smoked pork tenderloin, so I cubed it and added at the end.  Topped with diced tomato and Tabasco smoked chipotle!!  My husband really enjoyed it! Will definitely be saving this recipe!

Very easy and very delicious!  I added a few extra spices to make it spicier,  but my Family LOVED it!!! My hubby ate all that was left over!

Tasty rice and bean side dish, we all liked it, I also tossed in some fresh cilantro once done for more flavor.
