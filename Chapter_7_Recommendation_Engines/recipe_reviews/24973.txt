Very good, easy cake.  I made with a few minor changes.  After reading reviews, I used a 9 x 13 pan, which baked perfectly in 35 minutes.  To the batter I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I reserved 1 cup of crumbs, to which I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 2 tablespoons brown sugar.  I used approximately 2 cups of fresh blackberries.  Everyone loved it and a great cake to use up the never-ending blackberry supply!

This batter needs to be kept to a thickness of 1/2 inch in the pan prior to adding the fruit of choice and crumbs on top.  You will have difficulty with it baking completely if the batter is any thicker. I use an oblong cookie sheet with an edge or jelly roll pan.

We loved this.  Based on other reviews, I used a 9x13 pan and then the cooking time was right on.  Only slight problem with that is that I think it needs more blackberries when you use a larger pan.  Mine were too spread out.  Oh well, it was still delicious.  Thanks!

This is a very good coffee cake. I used a 9 x 13 inch pan and baked it about 45 minutes. I like the fact that the ingredients are simple and usually on hand. I'll be making this again and experimenting with using different fruits and jams.

This cake was quite good.  I used a 9 inch round cake pan, and used apricot jam on top instead of the fruit called for.  It took much longer for the cake to cook (at least 50 min in total) which may have been because of my substitution of the round pan.  Unfortunately, because it took so much longer to cook, my company had to leave before the cake was even out of the oven!  I will try this again though, with a square pan.  It is really wonderful with the apricots.

My husband really enjoyed this coffee cake.  I increased the berries to 2 cups and used a combination of blackberries and blueberries.  I baked it in an 8x11.5 glass pan and cooked it for an hour.

Excellent! This is a five star recipe! I made it for a brunch, and it worked great. You could add more berries if you wanted though.

Very good recipe and easy to make. I used a 13x9 pan like another reviewer suggested.  I served the cake warm with peach ice cream and it was wonderful.  I used fresh from the grower blackberries.

Loved this very easy to make coffee cake! I added 1 tsp of vanilla, held back 1 cup of the crumb mixture and used about 2 cups of blueberries ... since I used a 9X13 pan.  25 mins did it for me, it came out perfect.  Will certainly make this again.

In a 9x13 Pyrex and 2 cups of raspberries cooked 40 minutes.  Thought it needed a glaze top.  Added powdered sugar dissolved in milk for a light glaze topping.

I was looking for something simple as a dessert and found this. While I didn't have any berries I added cinnamon, vanilla, and apples to the base and some cinnamon to the crumb topping. We love it, I will definitely try this again.

Delicious and easy recipe!  Just use a 9x13 pan (like the other reviewers said) and use only fresh fruit.  I have made this with fresh blackberries, fresh blueberries, and fresh raspberries with excellent results.  Once I tried it with a variety of frozen berries that I had in the freezer and the cake was good at first, but after storing for one night it was very soggy and we had to throw the leftovers away.:(   This is always a hit with fresh berries!   Thank you for the great recipe.

I'm not sure what more I can add to the reviews, but this was wonderful.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan, placed 2 cups of frozen blackberries in the bottom of the pan and spooned the batter evenly over the top.  I sprinkled just a smidgen of cinnamon-sugar mixture over the top before baking, too.  My husband's office sent the empty pan back, asking for more.

The cooking time is way off, as others have stated, but other then that, it's a good recipe. I use 1 cup rice flour and one cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of mixed frozen berries. I put 1 cup of berries into the batter and the other on top.

This was so good! I only put in 1 cup of sugar as I didn't think it would need the full 1 1/2 cups. It made it a tiny bit healthier and still turned out fantastic!

I took another reviewer's advice and made sure that the batter was no more than 1/2" thick (before the berries and crumbs), and it came out perfect! It tasted delicious with a nice, hot cup of coffee. Thank you! :)

I love how simple this recipe is and the blackberries really make it something special. I made mine with whole grain white flour and it still came out great. I can't wait to try this recipe with other fruits!

I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Butter. Vegan egg replacer. Baked it in a 9 x 13 for 40 minutes. Excellent. Will be trying it with a variety of fruits.

Except for the addition of vanilla and almond extracts, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was fabulous.  My husband and I virtually demolished the coffee cake when taking turns getting out of bed overnight and snacking.  I really love blackberries and the simplicity of this recipe just rocks.  Oh, one more small change:  I dusted the pan with cinnamon/sugar instead of flour.

FANTASTIC recipe--rave reviews from my friends and coworkers.  The only change I made was to triple (the first time I made it) and double (the 2nd time i made it) the amount of berries.  Otherwise, this is the best fruit coffeecake recipe I've ever tasted.  Oh, and agree w/ other reviewers, espcially if you increase the amount of fruit, you will definitel need to increase the cooking time--with the 3 cups of berries I ended up baking for almost an hour, setting the timer after the initial 30 minutes or so, in 10 minute increments.

This cake was great...I have to agree with many of the other reviewers about the thickness of the batter.  I did it in a 9in round tin and my batter was pretty thick probably because I put in so many blackberries.  It just took WAY longer to cook....so plan on 45 min to an hour...or else pick a pan that will make the batter much thinner.

Well, I’m sorry to say that this one was a disappointment, not because of the flavor, but because this produced the flattest coffee cake I have ever seen.  The recipe calls for a 9” square pan, but the submitter states in her review that she uses a jelly roll pan.  That’s a huge difference.  I made half this recipe using an 8 1/2” spring form pan, which is almost exactly half the size of a 9x13, which most reviewers ended up using.  The flavor was good, but the appearance was really lacking.  Four stars for flavor, two stars for appearance = three stars.

So yummy, and so easy because all the ingredients are readily on-hand. I followed the tip of baking in a larger pan. Had to bake it about 40-45 minutes though till it was completely set in ther center. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream. Perfect summer dessert to use up those berries!

I added about 1 tablespoon of nutmeg, which took it to an awesome new level. We have blackberries growing in our backyard and this is one of my favorite recipes to make them into so far.

It's not very sweet, but thats the way we like it. I made this yesterday for our bible study that evening. The entire cake was gone in minutes. I used Splenda instead of regular sugar (because people that I bake for, are diabetic). I baked it in an 8 x 11.5 glassware for 30 minutes. Next time I think I will add another 5 minutes for baking.

A good use for wild blackberries.  I found that like the other reviewers said, it was not done in the time that was prescribed.  I was afraid of the top being over done so I lowered the temperature 25 degrees and baked for twenty minutes more.  Turned out well after the time adjustment.  Pretty and tasty!

This cake is certainly easy to make, however it's boring as is. It needs vanilla and spices of some sort ....cinnamon, nutmeg, possible grated orange rind. I have made many coffee cakes but this is one I will never make again. I even put chopped berries through the cake.

I was in the mood for coffee cake but all the recipes called for vanilla and I am out :(  I'm glad I didn't give up searching because I wouldn't have found this recipe :)  Blackberries are my most favorite berry, but I didn't have those either. What I had was fresh cranberries, about 1 1/2 cups. I decided to simmer them in water for a few minutes so they would be tender like the blackberry. I strained them and set them aside to cool. I substituted sugar with Fructevia and followed the remainder of the recipe as written. My pan size was 8 x 11.  It came out very nice, not too sweet.  When there was about 5 minutes left of bake time, I realized I had not sprinkled the top with the flour mixture that had been set aside. I contemplated finishing without it, but said ''what the heck''  and quickly sprinkled. In that short time the edges browned, but the rest did not. The taste did not suffer, but I'm sure the topping would be that much better, with a toastiness (sp?) to it. I am looking forward to making this with the blackberries & intended topping in the near future. That's when I will add a photo :o)  Thanks for your recipe!

This coffee cake is very good. It baked up not too sweet, had a very nice crust on the bottom and a slightly salty and sweet crumb on top. I only made half the recipe because I don't like wasting ingredients on a not-so-good recipe. I put the cake in a round glass baking pan and it baked perfectly for 30 minutes. I also used real salted butter instead of margarine and doubled the recommended amount of berries since I love berries. Hubs loved this one and will be made again and again.

Made as directed (except that I used 12 oz. of blackberries) and it was very good. A little plain. Next time I may add a pinch of cinnamon or brown sugar to the topping. It took an hour and ten minutes to cook in the 9x9 square.. far from the suggested 25 or 30!

FANTASTIC!!!  I needed to do something with all the wild blackberries growing in my back yard, and this was sublime use of this fruit, or any ohter fruit, I imagine.  Easy and delicious, one of the best cakes I have ever made.  Would be great for brunch, or dessert with whpped cream.  SOOOO easy!  I will defintely make it again, often.

Perfect! Absolutely Perfect! Hubby and I demolished 1/4 of the cake as soon as it came out of the oven! A KEEPER!    I did use a 9x13 pan as recommended by others and doubled the amount of blackberries only because I love them.

I was looking for recipe to make to use up some raspberries I had in the fridge, and I'm glad I came across this one!  Yum! My raspberries were huge, so I cut them in half and tossed them in sugar before adding to the top of the batter.  I also did as other reviewers suggested and used a 9x13 pan and baked for 45 minutes - came out perfect!  Will definitely make this again!

Great at any temperature but especially delicious warm, sprinkled with powdered sugar. I used 1 C wheat flour and 1 C all-purpose flour, producing a nutty flavor. I used 2 C frozen blackberries we'd picked earlier this year.

This was good, but not great.  I used the correct size pan, and it still took longer to cook. I didn't have a lot of flavor.  I would probably increase amount of fruit if I were to make this again.

This recipe is so delicious and inexpensive to make. I always have the ingredients on hand to make one of these in a hurry. I use a 9x9 glass square pan and cook it for an hour and it turns out perfectly every time. I have also substituted blueberries and apples (1 cup) for the blackberries and they all tasted like they came from a bakery. Great recipe!!

good and easy. After reading some of the reviews.  Only thing I did different was I just halved the recipe and baked it in a 9 in pie pan. 27 mins was perfect.  I think this recipe would work well for any type of berry.  I think next time I might try using buttermilk instead, or add a touch of almond extract.

I used raspberries instead of blackberries (I don't like blackberries). I wasn't a fan of this cake. The flavor seemed off for some reason. I brought it to a family get together, and very little of it was eaten. I did have a couple of people say they really liked it, though. I wouldn't make this again or, if I do, I'll try it with a different kind of fruit.

I used only 1 stick of butter (I don't have margarine) instead of a stick and a sixth, and I also used only 1 cup of sugar. There was a bit too much topping, so next time I would make a little less of it. Maybe 3/4 of each ingredient. The berries made the batter mushy, and I also used the wrong kind of pan. I used a ceramic pan instead of a metal one. It was also 10x7 instead of 9x9. It is harder for the heat to get thru the ceramic so th middle was almost completely uncooked. If you eat it cold, it's too buttery, but when you heat it up, it tastes less buttery. I probably won't make this again. :( my suggestion is DON'T USE A CERAMIC POT TO COOK THE CAKE!!!

If my husband is happy, then I'm happy!

This was really good except mine just wouldn't get done in the middle, I baked it for about 45 minutes before taking it out because the edges were getting a little too brown. I think next time, I'll try a slightly larger pan, so it's not so thick.

This was terrific! I made it to bring into the office and it was a hit.  I used frozen raspberries and it came out just fine.  It was easy to make, and very delicious. I, too, found it took longer to bake, about 45 minutes in a square glass dish. Will definitely make this again!

This is great and easy, but needs at least an hour to bake!  I used mixed frozen berries and it was a hit!

This recipe is very quick and easy to put together.  It is delicious without being overly sweet.  I have made it with blackberries, blueberries and raspberries so far.  I also added a bit of cinnamon just to  change it up a little.  Each time the cake is moist , and gone in a blink.  Definitely a new summertime favorite for what fruit is in season.

No changes made as recipe recommended. The cake was a little dry and thick will try again and adjust. Flavor was wonderful and it presented well.

Finally an easy, delicious coffee cake recipe that I can count on! You can use any berry you like. I have made this twice using blackberries and then raspberries. Next time I will try blueberries. Thanks for this tasty recipe,no changes necessary.

Made this in 9x13 pan. Added vanilla and a little cinnamon to the batter and a tad of brown sugar to the crumble on top. Used frozen Marion blackberries and parchment on the bottom/sides of pan. Came out great.

This is a go to recipe for me I have been using it for about 4-5 years. I modified it though. I always double the recipe and I change the fruit out based on what I have. Also I add vanilla. But my family’s favorite is Granny Smith apples. I also add cinnamon when I use apples. I’ve made this recipe with blueberries, strawberries, apples, peaches, and of course blackberries. It’s always delicious and all my picky kids love it!  I’d give it a 5 stars but I personally think the added vanilla is necessary.

I was looking for a blackberry coffee cake that had a crumb topping and this one sounded right.  I spread the batter in a 9X13 pan as suggested, so it was only 1/2 inch thick. The only problem was that the crumb topping was sparse in the larger pan.  Also, when it was cooked through, the topping hadn't browned at all, so I to  put it under the broiler for a minute to get it golden brown on top.   The taste of the cake was perfect, nice balance of blackberries and a little sweetness.

Just made this with fresh blackberries from the neighbors bushes. I substituted 1c coconut flour, added 1t vanilla, and 2t cinnamon. I then added unsweetened coconut flakes to the topping. Delish!  Did need to bake for 50 minutes.

I used blueberries, as it was what I had on hand. I was making it for a crowd so it was a huge  one I made, that took a very long time to bake but well worth the wait. I'd give it more stars if I could!

I use the 13" x 9" pan as suggested in other reviews. Also as suggested I kept the batter to a height of 1 inch. If you go higher, the center of the cake will not cook thoroughly. I baked it for 40 minutes which resulted in some brown edges on the sides. I think 35 minutes would have been better. When I checked it 25 minutes the center of the cake was still gooey and not ready yet.  On the top of the cake I took cinnamon and sprinkled the top of the crumbs, this gave it a really nice flavor when served. I served it at dinner time for dessert with a side of mango ice cream with the cake warm it was very well received. I also served it at breakfast by putting it in the microwave for 30 seconds on power level eight and put slivers of butter on top of the cake. It was a delicious breakfast cake served warmed with butter.

I made it the way the recipe called for with a few minor changes the first time. I added some vanilla to the batter and used both raspberries and blueberries, in lieu of blackberries and in the reserve crumble I added cinnamon. The second time I made it I didn't reserve any crumble and added lemon juice to the batter to make a lemon blueberry coffee cake. All in all I liked the recipe, however, I think it needs something more added to it to make it memorable. And the cake needs a bigger pan for the cook time given.

I made this with the suggestions Kathleen M. gave (added vanilla, cinnamon, & brown sugar). I also had extra berries so I mixed in about half a cup of blueberries to the batter before I topped the cake with more berries. I used an 8inch square pan. It tooks for about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes depending the oven I use (This is my second time making it). Over all, a lovely cake.

All of my guests loved this cake. I followed Kathleen M's recommendations, using larger pan, more berries, reserving 1 c. crumbles and added cinnamon to crumbles. With a little extra flour and an extra egg  it cooked up light and fluffy at very high altitude (8500 ft.) as well!

MMMmmm good.  I'll be making this one again sometime soon.  I had no blackberries so I used a combination of red and black currents, one cup of which just happened to be ripe enough to pick this morning. I also finely chopped an apple for a bit more fruitiness and to help relieve the tartness of the currants.  I baked the cake in a pan 8 x 9.75".  The cake rose beautifully, looked really lovely with glimpses of the black and red currants through the topping.  It took an hour to bake.  Certainly the recipe submitter is at odds with her own review.  While I might use a slightly larger baking dish next time, I cannot imagine baking this in a cookie sheet.

This recipe was so easy and very tasty! I made it with my 2 yr old. I floured a Bundt pan, and just added about 10 min to the cooking time (until a knife comes out clean) I liked the shortcut process of making the crumb in a large mixture and removing part, instead of making it twice! I used frozen blueberries and rolled them around in the dry mix before adding the liquid. I also added lemon and vanilla extract. It's delightful! Thanks!

I made this "easy platz" for my family to rave reviews. Though it tasted great, I had a lot of ploblems getting the top of the confection to be golden brown. Also, the "crumble" on top disintegrated. Overall a great post berry picking treat.

A delicious quick and easy cake to make..  I use a springform pan that has a hole in the center and it comes out perfect every time! I keep it in my cake stand overnight to soften up so it tastes even better the next day. I also mix in raspberries with the blackberries and everyone that has tried it loved it!!

I love this cake, I read the reviews and added two things from a couple reviewers. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to my batter and I added about a 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the crumb topping. Easy to make, and my whole family loved it! In fact I have one in the oven right now!

Love that is was super fast to make and simple ingredients that are always available.  Everyone that tried it loved it; however I added less sugar than it indicated and I thought it to be still too sweet.  I will make it again but with way less sugar and tart apples.

This was a great way to save blackberries that needed immediate attention!

A little too sugary for us...and we're a sweet tooth family.  Overall it's fine but likely won't make it again.

This was a GREAT recipe. It was quick and easy. I used raspberries along with blackberries and dusted the top with powdered sugar when it was done. It was delicious!!

I love this recipe because all ingredients were on hand at home, and I didn't have to go to the store for anything.
I took the advise of others and used a 9X13 dish so it was no thicker than 1/2 an inch thick, but it still needed to cook almost an hour.  
Be prepared for that.  (I had a very anxious birthday girl waiting for her breakfast cake!!) :)

Also, the blackberries we had weren't very good... not too sweet, so if that happens again, I think I'll just sprinkle some sugar on them before putting them on the cake - that should help.

But the cake was a hit - we'll make it again for sure. Thanks for sharing it!

I took this to a church breakfast and got good reviews.  It was also easy to make and I had the ingredients on hand.  I will make this one again.

Delicious!  I used a 9 inch glass baking dish, and it turned out beautifully!  Will definitely make again.

Awesome!  I used a bundt cake pan and put the topping on the bottom, then the fruit, then the cake batter and it turned out great.  I did have to cook it quite a bit longer but as long as you check doneness with a tooth pick you'll do fine.

Really easy and delicious coffee cake!   Following the advice of previous reviewers, I used a 9x9 inch glass baking dish and starting testing for doneness at 45 minutes (my oven is fluky so baking is an adventure).   I've used this recipe with blackberries and blueberries with excellent results each time.  As is my habit, I also substituted one cup of Splenda for the sugar, a cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup eggBeaters for the eggs, and one stick of light butter for the margarine.

one of the best cakes i ve ever baked...when i tasted the batter pre-cooked i thought it tasted a bit too floury...but it was fantastic when it was cooked...very moist...yummy...yet light and super easy to bake. i only make half the recipe so mine cooked on time and was great :) try to bake half the amount if youre having trouble with the time...cheers!

Fantastic flavor! Also works with raspberries. Baking time was twice as long as recipe, but worth it.

Pretty tasty, I baked it in a jelly roll pan and used about 1.5 cups of berries, I would probably use a few more if I made it again.

The recipe was very simple and easy to follow.  I used more fresh blackberries, and it turned out OK.  The cake was a little bit too sweet for me, so I will cut the sugar in the cake next time.  The crumb topping compensated the tartness of the blackberries.  The cake definitely was not done in 30 minutes.  Mine took almost 60 minutes to bake.  Overall it was a delicious coffee cake.

Okay... I think there ends up being much too much batter for only 1/2" on bottom and the flavor was decent but not good enough to be worth the calories (for me anyway). Worth a try to see if it's your thing!

This is the best tasting cake!  I only wish I had read the reviews before trying this 3 times trying to figure out why it wasn't getting done after at least twice the cooking time. Still a great cake.

Tasted delicious, but wouldn't bake through the center. I doubled this recipe, using a square pan and 2 bread pans. The bread pans worked perfectly, but even after testing clean with a toothpick the square pan (at about 40 minutes of baking) was pudding-like in the center.  I also reduced the butter to 1/2 c. per recipe and it was still very rich. Used chopped fresh apricots rather than blackberries and mixed them into the batter.  Very tasty, just tricky to bake thoroughly. I might reduce the butter a little further and try as muffins.

This recipe is good but I will have to experiment further with it to make it right. I used freshly picked blackberries: the riper the better because they are extremely tart. The cake cooks for much longer than the recipe states, I cooked mine for 50 minutes on 350 (ovens vary) and the middle was a tad underdone still but the edges on the corners got burned. Perhaps I should make a few adjustments or use a glass pan next time. The topping, however, is fabulous. I love the crispness of it. This dish is best served with your favorite brand of vanilla ice cream.
