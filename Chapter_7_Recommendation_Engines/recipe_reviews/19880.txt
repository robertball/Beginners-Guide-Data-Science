Don't let some of the reviews scare you away from trying this wonderful recipe! I almost didn't make this because of many reviews complaining about "the sweetness". I'm glad I did! I started by seasoning my chicken breasts with some white wine vinegar and lemon juice. I used the vinegar to offset the sweetness "problem". I then sprinkled black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder over the breasts. I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe as written. I used a fresh peach(with white flesh though) and used a "light" brown sugar to save calories. For the sauce, I used a combo of half cold water/half chilled white wine(Pinot Grigio) mixed with the corn starch. I sprinkled a bit of fresh parsley leaves over it all too. The end result was just fantastic, and even my boyfriend said he couldn't wait until I made this tasty dish again! And, the whole recipe was very quick and easy too. What more could I ask for? Try this, you'll love it! Thank you Lor for a delicious recipe!

The sauce in this recipe is one of the best I've ever tasted!  I used pork chops instead of chicken, seasoned them with meat tenderizer, salt and pepper, and browned them before assembling and baking the rest of the dish.  I bought a large can of peaches and only used about half the can with some of the juice.  I wish I had used the whole can as the peaches were so yummy in this dish.  At the end of the bake time I put it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown it nicely.  The combination of the pork and the peaches and the "to die for peachy, clove-y, gingery" sauce made this an unforgettable dinner.  It was also super easy.  I made this for a casual meal at home with my family, but would definitely serve it for company, too.  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

This recipe was delicious, but I would add one caution.  I made it for a potluck dinner.  I prepared it in the afternoon, sampled some for lunch to make sure I liked it (which I did) then placed the remainder in an attractive casserole dish to reheat in the microwave later for the dinner.  While it smelled and tasted good, the chicken absorbed the brown sugar and turned a brownish shade.  It was passed over by many people, but the ones that did try it said it was good.  My recommendation: try it but prepare it then serve it immediately.

This was really good! Like having peach pie for your main course!  A really different and unusual chicken recipe.  I used half of the brown sugar called for and I think it was more than enough. And I didn't peel the peaches -- not necessary.  I think you really need to make this with fresh peaches.  Canned just wouldn't be the same.

This was absolutely delicious! The chicken was tender and juicy and I really enjoyed the peach flavour. Like many other reviewers, I used canned peaches with the juices. Be sure to use a large can, as the cooked peaches are so tasty! Also I did not have ground cloves, so I substituted a sprinkling of cinnamon and a genourous amount of freshly ground pepper for some spicy heat. This was a real treat, the recipe is a welcome addition to my "Favourites" category, and I'll definitely be serving this dish again soon!!

I made this as the recipe says only I added a dash of cinnamon.  I also cut the chicken into small pieces.  I added the water and cornstarch to make a sauce and served over rice.  It was delicious.  (Oh I also used canned peaches and marinated the chicken in the peach juice from the can for about 2 hours before I cooked it)
*If you do not like sweet main dishes then you will probably not like this*

Very good, we enjoyed it.  I doubled the spices and added in some garlic powder.  Also I used thawed, frozen peaches and added in some soy sauce to help the sweetness people complained about (although I think that comes from using canned peaches in syrup) anyway, we did not think it was too sweet.  I did not add in water and cornstarch to make a gravy; I thought the juices were just fine as is.

This chicken was soooo good.  Everyone in the house loved it, and said we should have it again.  I used canned peaches in heavy syrup.  It made a nice gravy that we poured over mashed potatoes!

We love this one!  I've made it 3 or 4 times already!  Extremely easy and tasty, and I love how it gives you a fruit serving with your meal.  One word of caution though - go easy on the cinnamon!

Probably will make again.  Chicken was tender, jucy and flavorful.  It seemed to be lacking something though.  Not what shure.I used canned peaches instead of fresh and about 4 TBS of the syrup.  I cut the sugar in half. I poured off the sauce, reduced it and thickened it using 1tsp of cornstarch and a little water.  I also finished browning the chicken under the broiler.  Chicken does not brown under the curren recipe directions.  Sauce was excellent. Maybe needs a sour additive.

A keeper in my house!!!!!  I used a 29oz can of peaches in heavy syrup and therefore I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Used all the other spices as recommended and I also sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon over the top.  I only used 4 breasts in this dish also.  My husband make and "icky" face when he saw it in the oven but once he tasted it he said it was delish and wanted it to be a regular in our house.  My daughter said this is what she wants for her birthday dinner :o) Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I made this recipe with a slight change using canned peaches instead of fresh(Got to make due when they're out of season). The chicken was moist and sweet.  My boyfriend loved it; the leftovers didn't even last through the night!

This was a HUGE hit with my family. I took the advice of other reviewers and marinated the chicken first (teriyaki, lemon juice and garlic) then followed the recipe exactly as written. Next time I will probably brown the chicken each side briefly before baking.

Made this dish for a birthday meal and everyone liked the flavor. Instead of fresh peaches (out of season) I used 2 cans of peaches. DON'T use all the juice in the dish unless you want a ton of gravy. I also quadrupled the spices (ground giner & ground cloves) as I didn't believe it would give much punch with only 1/8 teaspoon. Glad I amped the spices up as it was very tasty.

Even my picky mother really liked this recipe.

Very fun! I had fresh white peaches and the only thing different is I sprinkled a little red wine vinegar and a touch of cinnamon. I think if you added some raisins it would have a moroccan flavor. Served with mashed potatoes which I thought was going to be odd but it went nice together.

Gorgeous!  Top marks for taste and ease!  Peach season hasn't arrived here yet so I used tinned peaches and, as a previous reviewer recommended, I used some of the juice from the can and poured it into the bottom of the baking dish.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the outcome. THANK YOU!

For those of you who ended up with dry chicken, you might want to try adding some pineapple juice to the bottom of the pan, and covering it with tin foil before baking.  Your chicken will come out moist and juicy.  Also, for those of you who thought it bland, simply season the breasts first with some salt and pepper, then follow the directions - it's amazing what a little salt and pepper will do to a dish!!!  Enjoy!

Excellent dish, the whole family enjoyed which is nice because I rarely cook. I did add pineapple like others suggested which kept the chicken very moist. I let the chicken sit in the pineapple juices and a pinch of ginger for about 30 min before adding the peaches. Using fresh peaches keeps the dish from being too sweet while the pineapple stops it from drying out. Also covering with tinfoil prevents from having to baste. Sauce thickened well with pineapple juice.

This was a good dish, but the suggestion of making the sauce didn't work at all.  I used pineapple in place of the fresh peaches, and it turned out well.  Next time, I'll add coconut, for an even more flavorful outcome.

I actually used Chicken breast tenders and cooked it in my slow cooker for 4 hours. Other than the wonderful smell teasing me all afternoon, it was GREAT. Even my picky 8 yr old son ate it and had seconds. I took some of the "juice" and poured it over the rice YUM! I posted a picture of my dish (it's the one with the broccoli and rice. :0)

This was an excellent dish.  The chicken was really moist and the peaches were a great taste match. I added cornstarch to the juice and used it like gravy over mashed potatoes.  I can't wait for my next dinner party.  My guests will love this, and think I spent hours preparing it.

We didn't really care for this recipe.  The flavor of peaches and chicken didn't seem to mingle well together and overall, the dish was pretty bland.  Maybe if there were some way to balance the sweetness with a sourness, it would make it better--kind of like sweet & sour chicken but with peaches instead of pineapple.

Heeding the other reviews that stated the chicken was too bland, I made a few changes. I cut four raw chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces and put them in a skillet, along with 8 canned peach halves (syrup drained and set aside). I mixed 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/8 tsp ground ginger, 1/8 tsp ground cloves, and 2 tbsp lemon juice in a bowl, then added the peach syrup to taste (until the main flavor was peach and not lemon). I poured the mixture into the skillet with the chicken and peaches and simmered it on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the chicken was done. The result was delicious--not too sweet, not too sour, and definitely not bland!

I love the simplicity of this recipe!  I is wonderful to make in a pinch and my kids love it.  Definately a keeper for me.  I use canned peaches (good fresh ones are hard to find) and wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

just made this tonight...absolutely fantastic!  I was a little worried after reading reviews that there wasn't a lot of flavor, so I marinated the chicken in canned peaches with syrup, but cooked it with fresh peaches.  Came out perfectly, just enough flavor

Very good!  I substituted some of the spices for what I had in my pantry (allspice, nutmeg and whole cloves) and marinated the chicken in the whole mixture for a few hours before cooking.  It was so unbelivably moist and tasty after doing that...I highly recommend.  Next time, I'll make the sauce to top it for extra flavor.  Canned peaches did the trick nicely and took on some of the spices for a nice change.

Wonderful!!!  I seasoned the chicken before adding the brown sugar and canned peaches.  I also reserved the peach juice and added it to the baked juices plus 2-1/2 T. cornstarch to make a delicious sauce for the chicken (and the rice sidedish)

I would actually give this 4.5 stars. It was really really good, except that my boyfriend and I didn't enjoy the ginger taste, we found it a bit overpowering. I think I'll put a little less next time, but even as it is it was delicious, and actually even more so reheated the next day. And the peaches were just awesome!!
Oh, and I also cut the sugar by about half... If you like things sweet, put the full amount, otherwise, half or 3/4 is fine! =)

My husband (the chicken hater!) said this was his favorite of all the many ways I have tried to make chicken palatable to him. I didn't have cloves so substituted allspice. We both thought it was tasty and would definitely serve it to company. I didn't measure, so I probably used a bit more seasoning than the recipe called for. Salt and pepper? Of course! I also added a bit of butter on top of the peaches. Yum!

Fantastic!  Easy to make.  Healthy to eat.  My family raved about it.  Instead of fresh peaches, I used one can of peaches and cooked the chicken in some of the peach syrup in a clay dish.  A tad sweet but still very good.

I made this tonite for dinner. And it was great ! Having said that I did tweak it . I used splenda blend brown sugar and used half of what was called for . A cup of brown sugar sounds like too much to me . I'll make it again though .

This was a GREAT recipe exactly as written.  I only had canned peaches, which I drained and substituted.  Not only was the chicken moist and tender, but the peaches were firm and had a good flavor too.  The addition of the cornstarch/cold water to thicken the juices is a great idea as well.  Quick and easy, will definitely make again!

I used canned peaches in natural pear juice.  You can't have too many peaches!  Doubling the recipe, I drained the juice out of 2 cans of peaches into a bowl and marinated the chicken in the fridge for several hours.  When I was ready to bake them, I lined the pan with chicken, sprinkled with a little cinnamon (not in the recipe), sprinkled the brown sugar, layered the peaches, including the juice from the remaining two cans.  Then I followed the recipe from there.  I had to bake it for 45 minutes instead of 30.  When the chicken was done, I poured the juices into a small saucepan and thickened with a little bit of cornstarch and water.  We ate it over rice.  Very different and good!

I used canned peaches like some of the other reviewers and marinated the chicken all day.  Still, the flavor of the chicken was not all that great.  It really didn't "absorb" a lot of flavor.  The peaches were tasty.  I won't make this again.

This sounded so good that I've now made it twice, but still no success. The brown sugar and seasonings give the peaches a great flavor, but the chicken is still very bland. I may just use this as a side dish of peaches and eliminate the chicken. I did use frozen peaches instead of fresh and I'd have to assume that it's better with fresh. Sorry.

This is quite possibly my favorite recipe from this site.  We've had it several times and love it!  In fact, I've been craving it lately and wishing I didn't have to wait months for peach season again.  :(  Prepare exactly as directed, it needs no help!

I used canned peaches instead of fresh - the recipe turned out WAY too sweet.  If using canned peaches, I would cut back on the brown sugar.  Also, I would omit the ginger and add a few dashes of cinnamon instead.

This recipe was really good. My husband didn't like it though because it had peaches in it, but I thought it was really good.I didn't have ground cloves so i used nutmeg and added some salt and pepper.I couldn't see using so much brown sugar so I used just enough to lightly coat the chicken and sprinkle some on top as well.If you are using canned peaches then I suggest you do that as well, because even if you drained the cans it will still be very sweet from the syrup.making the gravy is a must! Do you hear? A must!If you dont want the chicken to be dry cover the whole thing with tin foil.I will be making it again because it was really easy and easy to get the ingridients.

This was way too sweet for my family!  No one would eat the chicken.  I rinsed the sauce off and dried with paper towels and applied barbecue sauce and threw them on the grill, therefore, not a total waste of food.

I made this for my boyfriend, but I didn't make the sauce by adding the cornstarch, 
which I recommend that  you should.  He gave it a 2.5, and I gave it a four, so 
the overall average was about 3.  The chicken is moist, however, it does not have a
strong flavor.  The fruit/meat combo is really savory.

I halved the recip. Peaches were very good. Chicken was bland (I did salt & pepper and brown slightly). Did not make near enough sauce. I served with brown rice & steamed broccoli. I think you could get more sauce if you prepared peaches like you would for a cobbler (boil with a little sugar & water). Peaches would be somewhat softer but I think it would provide adequate sauce. Not likely to make again.

The first time I made this meal I found it really good but a tad too sweet.  The next time I went for more of a thai flavor and added 1 tbls chile oil and 4 tbls of soy sauce and really loved it.

I love this recipe....I also use pineapple in this recipe and its just as yummy. I will add a can of crushed pineapple over the chicken breasts and maybe a bit of tidbits or chunks then place a pineapple ring over each piece with a maraschino cherry in each one and secure with a toothpick..everything else remained the same.

Loved the flavor however my chicken was too dry.  Couldn't believe it would be after baking in the liquid.  Must've baked it too long.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good.  My boyfriend kept repeating it was delicious while eating it and he just asked me where I found the recipe as I'm writing this review, lol.  He thought it was superb.  I thought it was pretty good, but could have used a tad more flavor.  I even seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, black pepper and onion powder, as one reviewer suggested.      I thought the dish would be super sweet since I used canned peaches in heavy syrup, but to me it wasn't too sweet.  Next time I will add even more brown sugar and double the spices-but I LOVE sweet dishes.  The flavor was really great, I just wish there was more of it. I will be making it again.

While this recipe is fairly easy, it was also fairly bland.  I really felt like something was missing!  My kids weren't big fans either, but I think with a bit of tweaking, this could be very tasty!  My quick fix for the night was to use Bangkok Padang Thai Peanut Sauce as a dipping sauce.  Actually tasted pretty good after that!  Chicken was tender and I like the sweetness of the peaches.  I did cut back on the brown sugar by about 1/3 as well.  That seems to get rid of the overpowering sweetness other reviewers have mentioned.

Excellent dish and very easy to make. The kitchen smelled wonderful while it was baking. I used canned peaches, which were very tasty. Next time I will add the cornstarch to make the sauce thick. My fiance loved it and so did his picky 11 year old son!

This was really good.  I removed the chicken at the end of cooking and added some cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. I didn't have cloves so I used nutmeg, although I may not add the nutmeg again.

This is a great recipe.  I used frozen pitted peaches and it turns out great.  My only suggestion is to make sure you cut your chicken into smaller pieces or filet the thick ones to allow the flavor to be more encompassing.

I thought this was a great recipe, but my husband and I are big fans of Caribbean and Indian cooking, which uses sweet AND spice, so I added cumin to the brown sugar before sprinkling on top of chicken and peaches.  Also, didn't have cloves, so I took the advice of other reviewers and used cinnamon.  Will definitely make this again - next time, maybe try mixing curry and using mango instead of peaches.

I like this recipe, but honestly I keep expecting it to taste a little better. I have made it twice and my husband is very iffy about it. Maybe fresh peaches would be better?

This dish came out pretty well.  I used canned peaches and only 4 chicken breasts, so I halved all the other ingredients.  The chicken was extremely moist, but the ginger and cloves were little overpowering.  I also included half the juice of the peaches while the chicken baked, then poured the juice into a saucepan and added cornstarch to make a thicker sauce for rice.  The sauce on the rice was wonderful.  Next time if we make this again, I'll omit the ginger and cloves, add more brown sugar and cinnamon.

oh my goodness... tasty!  Definately don't be frugal with the peaches.  I used 2 medium peaches per 2 chicken breasts (4 big tenderloins, actually - cook faster and juice permeates easier) and I wished I would have used twice that.  At first I though I had too many peaches, but really... go for it!  The peaches I used were really ripe... the skin was really soft (perfect).  I peeled mine but perhaps you don't have to.  Don't worry about the dark red material in the flesh after you pit the peaches - leave that with the slices as it is NOT too hard and does NOT seem to affect the flavor.  Very easy to slice that way!  Also, I cooked mine in a bread pan in my toaster oven.  This kept the chicken covered with juice and no doubt added to the flavor.  If you wish to have more of the drippings "stick" when serving, put the chicken and peaches on the plate(s) and the juice in a small sauce pan (preferable metal).  Thicken up over low heat using small amounts of corn starch.  Drizzle over the chicken!

I made this recipe with "hard" peaches because they weren't in season.  It turned out fantastic.  The peaches didn't turn to mush like they would if they were canned or frozen.  When I cut them they smelled like peaches so I knew the taste would be there...and it was.  This is a very good recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

The only good thing that I can say about this recipe is that it made for great peaches to put on ice cream. The chicken was very bland. Thirty minutes does not cook good sized chicken breasts. I will not make this again.

Yummy! I cut the recipe in half because I only needed four breasts. I sprinkled the chicken with a little bit of salt and pepper before adding half the brown sugar & the peaches. Then I sprinkled a little ginger & cinnamon over the peaches (didn't bother to measure) and just a dash of clove (because that's all I had left) then topped with a light sprinkling of brown sugar. I cooked it in a covered 4 qt. casserole and didn't baste it once yet it still turned out tender & juicy. I spooned some of the extra peaches & sauce over brown rice on the side. My husband and oldest son loved it, the two younger kids didn't - but they're picky and don't like trying new things.

I'm a college student and I don't cook much, but this was SO easy.  I didn't have the ginger and cloves, so I just used some cinnamin and vanilla extract.  It's SOOOOO good!  My mom used to make a dish like this when I was a kid.  It even smells wonderful while in the oven!

I used thigh fillets and cut them in halves to enhence the flavour and texture since how most people here think the chicken turned out to be a bit plain and dry. I also used cassorol dish with lid instead of baking dish which kept the flavour well. I used canned peaches, well, two cans of them since canned ones don't have as much fruity flavour as the fresh ones. One good thing about using canned peaches though was that you can use the juice (natural/light) together with the spices of your choice to marinate the chicken first as suggested by many of you. I ditched the cloves however just coz I just don't like them...added instead, a little bit of chilli and it turned out quite a hit with the kids!

This was great.  I mixed it up alot though:  I used about 12 breast tenderloins instead of breast halves b/c they are smaller (more surface area=>more flavor).  I also let them soak in a mix of garlic rice vinegar, white wine, lemon juice, pepper, salt, and onion powder, in the fridge for about 2 hours.  I coated the baking dish with butter, and I drained 2 cans of sliced peaches.  I used way more than 1/8 tsp of cloves and ginger.  It made my apartment smell wonderful!!!!

I added crushed pineapple over the top of the chicken and dumped the rest of the pineapple juice in the bottum of the pan. I followed the rest of the recipe exact. The chicken had a perfect hint of pineapple marinated into it while cooking. Otherwise the peaches had a tiny hint of flavor but where more for apperance than anything. It really wasnt sweet, but fruity. I will make this again, pineapple included.

This is heavenly if you like peaches and the more you add, the better.  I did marinate the chicken in white cooking wine and lemon juice and added some spices.  Chicken was still a little bland so next time I will add salt. Be sure to thicken the sauce as suggested. Definitely a keeper.

We liked this recipe very much and didn't think it was too sweet.  There was a nice balance between the sweetness and the spices, but it was sweet enough to satisfy my husband's sweet tooth.  Since I made it in the winter when fresh peaches were not available, I used canned peaches in light syrup.  I agree with other reviewers that I would have liked more peaches as they really enhanced the dish.

This was very good.  The sauce didn't thicken up enough in the oven though. Next time I will add more cornstarch (maybe 2 T) while cooking.  The chicken stayed very moist and juicy, and when peaches are out of season I will use canned; maybe the syrup will also help to thicken up the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

It wasn't horrible, but not impressive at all.  The chicken itself was rather bland (um, 'scuse me, where's the salt??)  It was edible but I don't need to make it again.  There's a whole world of easy chicken recipes out there!

This recipe was awesome!!  I did use a few of the other recommendations that I feel made the recipe even more of a hit.  I soaked the chicken in white wine vinegar and the juice from 1 lemon.  Then added garlic powder, onion powder, salt pepper and a hint of cinnamon.  I also doubled the amount of other spices used, and I am sooooo glad I did.   I made a mix of light brown sugar, ginger, pinch of cinnamon and used all spice instead of cloves( they were out of cloves).  I used can peaches in heavy syrup.  I coated peaches in my brown sugar mix before putting them on chicken.  Once dish was done, I took  cooked peaches and chopped up and added to white rice as a side dish.  All the let over sauce was poured into rice as well.  My kids absolutely loved this and it definitely be in the rotation of meals in our house.

Although the chicken was tender I didn't get much flavor even though I sprinkled the breasts with crushed red pepper flakes. Next time I'll sauté onion and brown the breasts slightly,add salt and pepper and finish cooking on top of stove.

I used this as a base, and it was fantastic. Had boneless chicken thighs. Dredged in seasoned flour (salt, pepper, onion & garlic powders), and browned in olive oil in skillet. Moved chicken to plate, added a little more olive oil and some of the seasoned flour to make a roux. Dumped in a can of peaches with juice and another 2-3 fresh peaches sliced. Added brown sugar, ginger, cloves, splash of white vinegar (no lemon juice on hand) and chicken stock. Brought to boil so that it started to thicken, then returned chicken to skilled and put in oven at 350 for about 15-20 mins. Served over Basmati rice.

Found the chicken to be bland, and yes, I did season with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and like another suggested, a little bit of lemon juice and white wine vinegar to balance the sweetness of the brown sugar. The one positive were the peaches (used fresh ones) - they tasted great.

I so wanted to like this recipe but it just didn't work out.

1) 30 minutes at 350 degrees is not long enough to thoroughly cook the quantity of chicken suggested.

2) The chicken was just bland.

3) Despite the brown sugar, the peaches tasted sour, not sweet. (Uncooked, they were fine)

One of the best recipes I have had off of all recipes. The chicken is tender and the sauce is perfect when served over a nutty flavored rice. All I changed was adding salt and pepper to the chicken and some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it right before I served it. Family loved it and it will be a staple through peach season.

I made this with 2 cans of sliced peaches and some of their juice. It came out very sweet, but the chicken didn't cook all the way through. I'll try it again in the slow cooker but I'm going to use apricots & raisins.

Although everyone thinks this recipe is astounding, I found it to be meadocre.  It was too sweet, and the seasonings didn't compliment the chicken well.  Sorry folks.

very yummy and easy to make.  I used peaches from a jar, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  I would recommend using lots of peaches because they are so tasty after they're baked with the chicken!  That was the kids' favorite part!  Maybe next time I'll do as someone suggested and add cornstarch and water to the juices to make a sauce...

Good on creativity.  My family did not enjoy this at all.  The chicken came out juicy and tasted good, but there was no flavor from the peaches and the sweetness was odd.  We are an adventurous bunch but this did nothing for us.

Not that good. To be fair, I tried to substitute cloves for nutmeg. But still. It just tasted like chicken with peaches tossed on top.

Amazing! This is really good and really simple. I made it with canned peaches and little cinnamon in addition to the recipe's spices. Also, I seasoned the chicken with crushed black pepper and garlic powder; I served it with rice.

sooo good! This might be my new favorite chicken recipe. I used canned peaches and they worked great - if you use canned, make sure to add a bit of the juice also. I didn't have ground cloves, so I just tossed 10 or so regular cloves into the pan and then fished them out with a slotted spoon before serving.

My family and I LOVE this recipe! Easy to make and delish! I added some cranberries along with the peaches. I also used fettucini noodles and added the drippings to a wine sauce with some mushrooms. NONE of it was left, even my 4yr loved it...and he is PICKY! ;) If you want to impress company...this is the recipe you should make!

My only recommendation might be to pound out the chicken breasts so they cook more evenly. It was very tasty, made a nice presentation on the table and is one my husband said he would like to have again.

This recipe is pretty good. I used more brown sugar and added cinnamon.  I omitted the cloves and lemon juice. I used canned peaches and a can of pineapple chunks. It's a nice tasty change to ordinary chicken.

Very good recipe. I used canned peaches and poured the juice from the can into the pan. This made the chicken moist. I am sure without that liquid, it would've been really dry. I also used ground clove, ginger and cinnamon. PLUS, I added in a few shakes of soy sauce to mix it up. Mmmm, good!

Cooking time was actually 45 minutes.  I think this recipe would work best if the breast were pounded to a lesser thickness and add a little butter, however not sure if that will bring more flavor to the chicken.

This was really great and fast! I excluded the clove (mainly because I didn't have any!) and added a bit of cinnamon. I also used canned peaches and used the light syrup to bake the chicken in. It turned out very tender and quite tasty. Certainly a new family favorite in my household.

This was great!  I only had 4 chicken breasts, so I halved the brown sugar but used the same amount for the other spices.  I also used canned peaches and poured most of the juice over the chicken.  I think it gave it a very nice flavor.  Last, I sprinkled the chicken with cinnamon.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this tasty treat! What a change from plain old baked chicken. The chicken bakes up nice and moist this way. It was easy to prepare, and clean up was a snap. The merging of peaches and chicken was something I never thought would taste as good as this did. I highly recommend this tasty dish as an alternative to the everyday baked chicken.

I have given this recipe a two, only because the peaches and rice I served it with were flavorful because of the sauce that formed during cooking the peaches and chicken.  But the chicken was bland at best.  I was hugely disappointed and I followed the recipe as it is written.  Seriously think twice before making this.

I tried this recipe out on my family. We all thought it was a keeper. I left out the ginger and replaced it with allspice,since we are not big fans of ginger. I also used peaches from my tree that I had frozen with out sugar, it added about 10 minutes cooking time but cut prep time about 10 minutes so it was a wash. I will be serving this dish when I cook for my gourmet group next month!

Very good use for supermarket peaches that aren't quite peachy enough to be good "straight."  Since I don't like very sweet main dishes, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, and blended in 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a dash of cayenne pepper along with the spices.

This was a terrific, quick, work day meal.  I used fresh unpeeled peaches.  They were so sweet and flavorful!  I lightly browned the chicken first in a skillet and then follwed the directions as written.  I used half of the sugar called for and that was plenty for my taste.  You should give this a try.

It was really easy and fast to make, and the peaches topping with the syrupy brown sugar and cloves was deliciously sweet. however, the chicken itself was pretty bland and not very tender at all. i think i'll make this again but with first marinating the chicken as other reviewers was suggested.

Easy to prepare, I am glad I used fresh peaches and not canned peaches (always easier when they are in season :) I will definitely make this chicken dish again - something different for a change.

The only reason this recipe is getting any stars is because my husband thought that it was okay. I honestly HATED this. I could not eat any of it! I am normally a big fan of fruit and meat combos, but this was just sweet- ONLY sweet. It could maybe be improved with a LOT of spices(maybe cury & red pepper). The only flavor that really came through was SWEET. I will not make this again.

yum!! the peaches on this were great! it tasted like dessert for the main course. i put in a few more peaches than the recipe called for, and i would recommend that, because the peaches are so tasty. some of the chicken was dry, and i would have liked my juices to thicken a little more. but the peaches were excellent. great served with rice.

I made half the recipe using 2 chicken breasts (with bone)and 2 legs.  The taste was sensational. My husband was really impressed with the fresh peach flavour and presentation.  I served it with chicken flavoured couscous enhanced with shredded zucchini.  Would not hesitate to serve it to dinner guests.  Joy

This recipe was delicious!  The sauce didn't thicken in the oven, so we poured the juice in a separate dish, added more cornstarch mixture (1-2 Tbsp?), and microwaved the sauce for about 30 seconds until it became thick.

Not my thing.  The spices overpowered the peach taste and didn't compliment the chicken that well.  I liked it better with barbeque sauce.

Super simple, fast, and tasty. I kept returning to read the recipe certain that I must have left out a step. But no, it's that easy and fast. I took another reviewer's recommendation to marinate the chicken in white wine vinegar and lemon juice before I browned the breasts in a skillet. After baking I was easily able to thicken the gravy with the corn starch solution. We are not big on sweet flavors and this dish was not overly sweet. I used an entire bag of frozen peaches, too. I am getting requests to make it again!

This is a great crowd pleaser! I needed a simple, low-fat chicken entree so I tried this recipe. Everyone loved it! It has wonderful flavor, very tender, and pairs with a variety of vegetables. Now everyone in the family has the recipe.

I used 2 peaches as they needed to be used up. It made for really juicy chicken. I sliced up the chicken breasts before hand which stretched the recipe a bit further.

Excellent. I made this dish the other day. I found that by cutting the chicken (2 breast’s butterfly style) salt and pepper both sides and frying it until brown on 1 side, made the chicken look better, didn’t look boiled! I mixed peach juice (in its own juice) with slightly more then 1/4 cup brown sugar, ginger, cloves and about 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and about 1 1/2 teaspoons of chili sauce  in a bowl so that it was all incorporated. Placed the peaches on top of the chicken and poured the mixture over the top. Broiled this for 8-10 minutes so the peaches  were slightly brown and the chicken cooked through, served with rice with a drizzle of the peach sauce. Loved it!

I wouldn’t normally comment when I changed the recipe, however a little change is ok.  But for something a little different.. my husband likes hot so I added almost a quarter cup of jalapeño chutney, cut the sugar down to a quarter cup and used  2 cans of peaches in its own syrup. Delicious

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect! It did take me three times of making this recipe to get the sauce to thicken properly but once I got it too work, it was amazing! I will be adding this to our dinner rotation!

Delicious!!  
Decreased the sugar, for our tastes 1/2 cup brown sugar is lots.  
My hubby isn't a fan of cloves so I used cinnamon instead.  
1.5 c of frozen peaches from last summers fruit crop.  
Chicken thighs as that's what I had in the freezer.  
Next time I would cook the chicken 10 minutes then drain the grease before adding sugar and peaches.  
Will be making this again!

I had to make a major change to the recipe as peaches are not yet in season; I used canned peaches and that made it much too sweet.  Still, it wasn't very flavorful, so I probably won't try it again.

My family really liked it!  I made some substitutions and additions to suit our taste.  First I substituted fresh Macintosh apples for the peaches since it is harvest season now.  I also added dried cranberries and walnuts to the dish.  Used some spices that go well with apples (cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg).  It was like eating dessert and the main entrée at the same time!  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Next time I will use about 1/2 of the brown sugar though.  I had packed the brown sugar down when measuring. I wouldn't do that again.

I was skeptical of a sweet chicken, but this turned out great. Only thing I think I will do next time is add a little salt.

Unbelievable! So good and SO easy! Used fresh ginger instead of ground and also added a lime. Will definitely make this again and share the recipe with friends.

I've made this twice and it turned out great both times.  I used a large can of peach halves instead of fresh because they were not in season.  I shared this recipe with a friend and she loved it too.  Easy, looks good and tastes delicious!!!  This is a yummy meal for any night but I wouldn't hesitate to prepare this for a special occasion as well.

The cooking time on this recipe is all wrong! After 30 minutes I was left with completely raw chicken. Unless your cooking miniature chicken breasts, than plan on higher temperature and longer cooking time.

It was pretty good. I didn't have any clove so I substituted cinnamon. It maybe could have used a pinch of salt.

This was fine, I guess, but nothing to write home about. I would suggest using smaller chicken breasts when you make this - we had a mixture of very large and very small ones, and the large ones didn't really take on much flavor, so they were just sort of boring chicken with peaches on top. The smaller pieces that sat farther down in the "sauce" while baking soaked up a lot more of the flavor of this dish.

Taste was good when I made the spices each 1/4 tsp. I used 8 chicken thighs at high for 4 hrs. Next time I'll reduce that to keep them moister. Cornstarch in the juices made a great sauce over the chicken and white rice (which I cooked in the canned peach juice).

Loved this! Had to cut the recipe down as there are only 2 of us.I think next time I will mix the spices and brown sugar together so in will be spread evenly over the chicken and peaches.My husband raved about it over and over. Will be making this again!

We all thought this was delicious and the kids liked it too.  I made some changes.  I used 6 chicken breasts and used only 1/2 cup of sugar.  Subbed 1 tbsp of white vinegar for the lemon juice, subbed all spice for cloves because I was out, added a few shakes of cinnamon, doubled the ginger and all spice, and I added a 1/2 cup of coconut rum.  It was really good and not too sweet.  The sauce didn't thicken up like I'd hoped with the corn starch, but it was still good over the rice.

This didn't taste bad, but it wasn't the special meal we had hoped for.   When we added soy sauce at the table, that helped significantly, but still not a wow kind of meal.   I wondered when I put in the lemon juice if I had accidently tipped in a bit of extra lemon, but if I did, it was hardly any.... We didn't have fresh peaches, but other reviewers had good results with canned, so we thought this might work out better.  We did try to drain the peaches very well, but perhaps we didn't dram them quite well enough? Perhaps tripling the spices would have helped - or maybe we would have wanted even more.  Also, cooking the chicken separate from the sauce, at least at first might have helped.  We don't know if we'll try this again.  Typically we don't care for fruit with our meats unless it is salsa, or it is sweet and sour...., maybe it's just us.  HMMMM, MAYBE THIS NEEDS A BIT OF VINEGAR INSTEAD OF LEMON?????  In spite of our tendency, we were encouraged to try this because of the great reviews.  I'm glad someone is enjoying this.......

This was amazing. I added a little dry white wine to the dish. This combined with the juice from the peaches, lemon, and brown sugar gave it a really nice flavor. I left out the cloves (not a fan of cloves) and used chopped candied ginger instead of ground. This was a fabulous combo with the peaches. My husband loved it! Awesome summer dish.

edit: I tried this later with mango.. NOT as good- flavor just wasn't there. Stick with the peaches.. soo much better.

I liked this dish but I was disappointed because the rest of my family did not.  My husband said it was "acceptable" and 2 of the three kids could barely eat it.  One flat out refused.  They are not usually picky eaters so this really surprised me.  I made it with canned peaches and added 1/8 tsp of cinnamon.  I served it over rice.  I guess I will be eating leftovers for lunch this week!

We have made lots of chicken dishes and this one just didn't have the flavour we were hoping for.  Sort of made us think of school cafeteria chicken.  Quite bland, really.  But we always enjoy trying new recipes, and we ate it all, so there you have it.

This was very good.  Easy to prepare (I used canned peaches) and very attractive with parsley as a garnish.  It's a recipe you can make for two or a crowd.  Will be making this again and sharing the recipe.  Thanks!

Very creative way to use peaches when they are in season. My husband and I usually go for more savory dishes but this was a welcome change for our palate. The chicken was incredibly moist and the peaches added a great texture to the dish. I follow the other reviewer's suggestions by using less sugar. Great late summer meal with brown rice and veggies.

This wasn't horrible, but this wasn't great either. I cut the spices way down since I was only doing 4 chicken breasts and I still had too much after really really coating the food with it. I added the cumin, which gave it a nice twist, but it still was just okay. There was lots of juice, but the chicken seemed a bit dry. Thanks for the recipe, but it just didn't do it for us.

I have made this twice, once for myself and once for me and my 10-year-old grand daughter.  We both like it very much.  It is easy to cut the recipe and make smaller portions.  I did add a little cumin to the brown sugar mixture.  I will definitely make again!

This was a great use of the peaches! I love baked chicken and really enjoy having a new way to make it.

my kitchen smell so good while i am cooking this sweet recipe... i let the chicken breast get a golden sparkle with just a little of pam cooking spray, then in a small pan boil chicken broth, cloves, ginger and brown sugar then added to the chicken breast and let it cook. At last added canned peaches and juice. I didnt use lemon juice.

This was really good.  I served it with chicken rice with raisins.  I used fresh, tree-picked peaches and they were delightful.  Because the peaches were fresh and not canned, they had a great firm texture after being cooked.  I will be making this again.

This is a great recipe!  Thank you.  Followed it to a T (other than reducing the servings to only two) and served it over cooked rice.  We'll definitely be making this again!

Used fresh peaches & added split fresh bing cherries as well for color (they both tasted wonderful after the baking!) I changed some of the flavoring spices per others' reviews. Be careful what dish you select to bake this in, the sugary juice bubbles a LOT & leaves a nasty burnt mess all over the oven if it gets out! Hubby was not impressed with getting to eat dinner & dessert at the same time. However, he is not generally a fan of sweet dishes. (We needed to use up some fresh peaches so I gave this a shot)

I've been looking for recipes with fresh peaches (my mom gave me a ton from her garden) and I thought I'd give this a try.  I liked it as I like most things sweet, but my brother didn't really care for it.  I'd make it again but just for me.

This was delicious. I served this to my husband, five-year-old nephew and a very picky friend and they all loved it. I tripled the spices and added some freshly ground pepper and a pinch of salt to zest it up a little more. This will be a summer favorite for us!

OMG!  This was soooo good!  One of the best I've ever made off this website....and it was so easy and quick too.  I followed other reviewer's advice.  I used 2 cans of peaches in natural juice, and then poured 1 can of the juice over the pan before I put it in the oven (2 cans of juice would have been too much).  I didn't use lemon juice, cloves or ginger...instead I sprinkled the chicken with cinnamon.  Served over rice and it was perfect!

This is a great recipe!  My typically picky husband liked it and it was very low in sodium which is great for my blood pressure!  I used nectarines since I had no peaches and also added a can of crushed pineapple and some cinnamon in addition to the regular spices.  I also was heavy handed with the lemon juice.  I cooked it about 45 minutes and frequently spooned juice over the whole thing to keep it moist. It smelled so good while cooking that we started joking about eating dessert and dinner at the same time.  It's important to eat the fruit with a bite of chicken.  The fruit eaten in a bite without the chicken was way way sweet, but otherwise quite YUMMMMMMMMMMMMY!!!!  A definite repeat.

This recipe grows on you with every bite.  The sweet peaches really set this dish apart from the ordinary Chicken dish.  HINT:  You almost cant make enough rice for this.  It makes more juice/sauce than anticipated.

I made this without ginger.  Instead, I used ground cinnamon and sort of sprinkled it over the chicken.  I didn't have ground cloves so I just put a few whole ones in to soak into the chicken.  I adlibbed the lemon juice and brown sugar...which means I used more than called for, and I had canned peaches instead of fresh.  It was superb!!!  I made it with freshly mashed potatoes.  It was a great meal for a starving student!  Cheap and very easy!!!

The peaches were delicious, but in general this didn't work quite as well as I'd hope.  Somehow the chicken just didn't absorb enough flavor.  Certainly not bad, but not very exciting either.  It was very easy, which was nice.

It had good flavour.   I used canned peaches & I substituted cinnamon for cloves.  The drippings were thickened for a sauce.   I will definately be making this again.

This smelled wonderful (like peach pie!) but didn't have as much flavor as I hoped.  I would use lots more peaches for that amount of chicken.  I didn't try thickening the drippings for a sauce, but wish I would have.  It is very watery otherwise.  Served with rice.  It was alright.

I would give this four and a half stars. My family really enjoyed this recipe! I will make it again. I marinated the chicken overnight in peach juice that you can buy at Target along with the spices and also added some cinnamon. When I baked it, I used really fresh peaches and added some more cinnamon.

I thought this was DELICIOUS. I put in a bit more brown sugar and added cinnamon. It was wonderful served over rice and my whole family loved it. I let it marinate in the mixture for a couple of hours prior to baking. It did take more than 30 minutes too, closer to 45 min. and my chicken breasts were thin.

The 1st time I made this it was bland-ish but still pretty good. The 2nd time I added a little butter and cinnamon, and marinated the chicken overnight. I'm not a fan of cloves so those were left out both times. Thanks for the recipe!

A little on the bland side, but marinating helps. The second time I doubled and added cinnamon/sugar mix to both sides of breasts and doubled peaches, then refridgerated about 4 hrs. I basted throughout baking time and it came out tastier. Will make again, but w/ modifications.

simple to make, can use canned peaches (drained) in off season. I cut back on cloves as it was a little too overpowering

I thought it was good - nothing extraordinary, but a good light meal.  If you keep frozen peaches on hand it's the perfect meal in a pinch.  I would use more peaches though!

This is awesome. I marinated it for two hours first in some store-bought terriyaki thing. Didn't have any cloves and forgot the lemon juice, but otherwise followed the recipe. Oh, and used a casserole dish with lid as someone suggested. I added the cornstarch, but my 'sauce' never thickened. That's ok. The spooned-on juices were still good. Serve over rice.

Uck, this was awful. I love cooking with brown sugar, and experimenting with fresh fruit. This recipe sounded so good I just had to try it. Maybe it was the tang of the lemon that did it in, I just don't know. I won't be making this again.

I didn't use the ginger or cloves as I don't like them, and I used fresh peaches I think it would've been horrible with tinned peaches.  Anyway it was quite good, the peaches were really nice and sweet.  A bit like apricot chicken except I preferred the peaches.

The blend of spices was perfect.  This was an unusual but pleasant change for chicken.  Even my picky kid who doesn't like chicken breasts loved this recipe because ours turned out tender and juicy and she loved the flavor.  I'll be making this often.

I used can peaches since they were not in season.  I used one can and should have used two because the sauce was not very much.  It was fun to try but most likely wil not make again.

This was a good quick meal. It is on the sweet side, but my family liked it. I didn't have ginger, so I subbed cinnamon for it. I will make this again when I need a quick meal to throw together.

My husband only gave it 1 star and I gave it 3 so overall, it gets a 2.  Although I found the taste of the brown sugar and ground cloves to be very pleasant with the chicken, I felt that the chicken itself was rather bland.  I think next time I may marinade the chicken with the other seasonings.

The chicken came out very tender and flavorful. I used canned peaches instead of fresh, and poured a few spoonfuls of the peach juice over the chicken before cooking it.

This was very good.  I doubled the amount of peaches and used fresh ones without peeling them.  It turned out great.  My picky toddler even liked it.  It was not a pretty dish, but a great change of pace for the week-night family dinner.

The recipe was easy enough but there was something about the peaches that left the chicken with a strange, out-of-sorts texture.  It was just kinda weird.  Not one of my favorites.

Was okay, but pretty bland.  Would try adding onions and/or garlic to the peaches if I made it again.  Family ate it, but it wasn't anything they'd request in the future.

i thought this recipe was pretty good. not spectacular, but its always nice to have one more thing to do with chicken.
