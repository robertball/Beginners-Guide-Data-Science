Dear Braycorp,
After some minutes of simmering the mixture of flour, butter, milk and nutmeg should be thick like custard. This white sauce, used as topping, is called bechamel.

This was delicious! I made three changes which I don't normally do but wanted to make this recipe easier. First I roasted the vegetables in the oven. Caoted with cooking spray...easy. I added french onion soup mix to the beef because I wasn't in the mood to chop onions. Lastly since we were hungry and I had two hungry babies I skipped out on the bechamel all together. Just sprinkled feta cheese. I'm sure the sauce would have made the recipe but I decided that it would be healthier for now anyways! I was pleased to find this recipe on an ingredient search. Ive wanted to try the moussaka at our local family restaurant for quite sometime-now I HAVE to try it!

This is a good moussaka recipe but bland and a bit cumbersome.  I used only 2 lg eggplant, no zucchini.
Vegetable Changes:I sliced the eggplant in to 1/4 in slices, spritzed with olive  oil spray and baked in a 400 oven for 10 minutes on a parchment lined pan.  I boiled the potato slices for 4 minutes.  
Bechamel was good and only change I made was way more than a pinch of nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon is more like it.
Meat/Sauce changes:  Peeled the tomatoes.  Added 1 t cinnamon, 1/4 t ground allspice, and a pinch of ground clove.  Added two cloves of garlic, minced to the sautee.  Omitted parsley because I didnt feel like going back to the garden and my son brought me cilantro by mistake when I sent him.  Added 1 T tomato paste and a 1/4 c red wine.  I thought sauce looked runny so I thickened with a slurry of 2T water and 2 t cornstarch.  WIth my changes it is a 5 stars.  
It makes an enormous quantity, but that is OK because it freezes well.  I took the leftovers, and chilled in fridge.  I cut into serving size slabs and wrapped in a double layer of wax paper.  Shoved all the wrapped slabs in a labelled ziploc bag.   Now I have excellent lunches to go.  Take a slab to work and it defrost in time to heat nicely in a microwave.

I thought this was delicious! It was time consuming but making this moussaka was quite enjoyable for a rainy evening with the place to myself. I brushed the veggies with olive oil and baked them in the oven at 375 degrees instead of grilling them. Each vegetable had a different cook time for me so I would recommend monitoring and poking around a little to assess when the vegetables are soft to your liking. My final product included some water at the bottom of my baking dish but this did not translate to a watery moussaka. The sauce was super creamy and the feta was a delicious touch. Plus my apartment smells amazing.

I can't praise this recipe enough! I made it exactly as written because I wanted to get an authentic flavor. What I got was a masterpiece! I preferred the grilled vegetables to fried. My family LOVED this dish and I know I'll be making it again soon. It's well worth the time and effort to make it right with no shortcuts.

Wow this is really really good. This is my first time making moussaka and it turned out very good. I used 4 red potatoes 2 zucchini and leftover grilled eggplant that my mom cooked. I also added some crumbled bacon leftover spinach and artichoke dip and substituted tomato paste for the tomatoes. I also cut the sauce down because my tray was about to overflow but it added a nice "crust" at the top. Baked for 55 minutes. Awesome! I know this will be all gone tonight.

Tastes good but I did not understand the instruction in step 4 that said "whisk in 1/4 cup of the thickened milk" How do we get here? I just put in the milk and it does taste good.

I have made Moussaka a few times before....and I have been hesitant to make it for the last couple of years because it is such a heavy dish. Your idea of grilling the veggies is just what I needed. I'm going to start making it again. Thanks

Good Recipe- Definately much lighter than the original fried moussaka-- (Good for a treat) In regards to Braycorp's question "whisk in 1/4 cup of the thickened milk" How do we get here? The step calls to put the milk into the flour and simmer to thicken it. This is the "thickened milk" You take a little bit out of the pot and beat it into the egg REALLY quickly as not to cook the egg- Kind of like you would for an avgolemono soup- Never heard of making bechamel like this but it did come out good as well.

Delicious! I have never made moussaka before but have seen it done on cooking shows on TV. I roasted the veggies in the oven with olive oil instead of grilling. I think I might have cooked them a bit too long because the potatoes and zucchini were a little mushy while the eggplant was fine. If I were to make this again I would definitely shorten the cooking time for the veggies. I also added garlic crushed red pepper sugar a small can of tomato sauce and 2 cans of diced tomatoes to the meat mixture. I used rice milk instead of regular milk due to a whey allergy and tossed in grated parmesan cheese in between each layer. Baked it for about 40 mins and it came out very good just a bit watery. Maybe that was because of the canned tomatoes or because I overcooked the veggies. But overall it is a good recipe..not so heavy and very interesting. Try it it's time-consuming but the flavors are great! A nice way to spend a stormy Sunday afternoon!

I use 2 square 9x9 pans and I prepared the veggies and the meat as directed. I made the bechamel sauce for one pan and froze the other without bechamel sauce. This is an excellent alternative to lasagna when you don't have the pasta or ricotta.

This tasted good but it was pretty watery and the topping didn't set as well as I'm used to when I order it in restaurants. I used fresh tomatoes and wonder if that is why or whether the zuccini made it so. I made it without potatoes because I didn't have any in the house. Perhaps they would have absorbed the liquid. My husband liked it but I think I won't bother to make it again. It was too much work for too little reward.

This was so delicious! My husband decided he was making a Greek eggplant appetizer (this was his ONLY plan for dinner) so I had to come up with something quick that would complement his choice. We enjoyed this so much! I forgot to add the egg yolk but it didn't seem to affect the outcome. My family was very happy with this dish and my husband's appetizer came out great also (in case you were wondering). Thanks for sharing this Greek treat we'll make it again!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made some variations to see if I could make it even healthier - using Meat Crumbles from MorningStar (soy) skim milk and pam spray instead of olive oil. I also used only about 1/2 the white sauce I prepared based on the recipe's quantities. The end product was delicious! I calculated approximately 250 calories per hefty serving with these changes. Thanks for the GREAT healthy variation!

This was my first attempt at moussaka - delicious!!! It was creamy and hearty but not at all heavy. The quantities seemed huge at first but fit perfectly together into my large lasagne dish. The only changes I made were to add garlic (3 cloves) to the mince as well as some thyme.

Oh WOW! This was delicious. Time consuming but well worth the effort! I used my grill pan for the veggies. Had a small round seedless eggplant and yukon gold potatoes but omitted the zucchini-didn't have any. Also used about jarred spaghetti sauce instead of tomatoes 'cause I didn't have them either. Turned out great! Next time I'm gonna try this with ground lamb. Thanks Constantina!

THe concept was interesting but the result disappointing. THis took a lot of work but seemed dry and tastless. Have tried a baked not fried moussaka which seemed to do lower-fat better.

Very good! I doctored up the gravy (bechamel) with a little parmesan cheese and sprinkled a little parmesan on top of each veggie layer. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use onion soup mix instead of onion - it was a very nice flavor boost. Next time I may try it without to get a more traditional meat sauce. Ground turkey worked great and halving the recipe still gave us plenty leftovers for hubby and I. Thanks for the recipe!

I roasted the eggplant in the oven as it was too cold outside to grill. Made no difference as far as I can tell. The white sauce recipe is generous and the instructions are easy to follow. This one's going to be a favorite.

WOW! Although this dish is a little bit time consuming it is not difficult and it worth every minute! I followed the advice of some other ratings and I oven roasted my veggies in some olive oil and instead of using fresh tomatoes I used some leftover homemade tomato sauce. It was better than the moussaka at my local Greek food festival!

This was Great! My husband kept saying..."What is that?" A casserole I answered...While he was eating he said "OK this is really good you can tell me what it's called now." Lol. I didn't have eggplant but grilled zucchini & tomatoes from my garden. Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch. Mmmm

First time making moussaka and this wasn't what I remembered from Greece. I learned a few things making this and might try a different recipe next time. I sliced my zucchini too thick so its flavor was too strong in each bite. I almost burnt the zucchini and eggplant on the grill (its too far from the kitchen) so need to do the first couple things one at a time instead of all at once. I cooked the potatoes on the grill in a grill dish (don't know what it's called a square metal dish with holes to BBQ with) and that worked great so they didn't overcook. Not enough nutmeg in here - couldn't even taste it and I used more than a pinch. Don't need to use olive oil to cook the ground beef. My sauce didn't come out great. Not sure why. It wasn't as thick as I expected.

I was delighted to find what is described as a lighter version - but noted half a cup of olive oil plus 5 tablespoons butter and more oil with the meat mix - nothing light about this recipes though I'm sure it's delicious just too oily for my waistline

If you love to cook this is fun to make but does take time. On the second attempt I boiled the potatoes and put foil and olive oil on the grill to cook the eggplant and zucchini. My grown son who is a picky eater asked why I didn't make MORE! Well worth the time it takes.

Absolutely delicious as is! Could add a little more spice/flavour to the meat. I roasted the veggies in the oven at 375 F and used venison instead of beef. I added a little garlic to the meat and used parsley flakes (from lack of fresh parsley). It was my first time making béchamel sauce and it turned out great (be careful not to let it burn and don't be too cheap on the nutmeg) and the amount was perfect. I worried that it wouldn't all fit in the 9x13" dish but it filled exactly to the top and didn't spill over while cooking. It took me 2 hrs to prepare the 30 mins final cooktime. I enjoyed making it and we really enjoyed eating it!

As always I had to tweak the recipe a little although I'm sure it would have been fantastic without any changes. Instead of grilling the potatoes I made mashed potatoes and spread them over beef mixture. Then I poured the bechemel sauce over the potatoes. I also took another reviewer's recommendation and used 1/4 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg instead of just a pinch. I think next time I will use a little less sauce though. It's really rich!

This was very good and I made it pretty much as directed eliminating the oil in the pan prior to browning the beef. I also used two egg yolks because I made a little extra béchamel sauce and it needed thickening. I would make this again. This was my first adventure with eggplant. Also the weather is bad here so I didn't grill I just roasted veggies in oven prior to layering with a spritz of olive oil. All together a hearty change from our normal cuisine!

Having bought some eggplant at the farmers market I was looking for grilled eggplant recipes and happened upon this one. I don't eat meat or dairy but it was very easy to veganize. I used Gardein crumbles to replace the ground beef (although I might try with mushrooms instead next time) and almond milk and non dairy butter in the sauce. And I used a vegan feta cheese I made with tofu. I grilled the veggies one night and assembled and baked the next night so I didn't really find it that time consuming (I did use canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh). I found this very tasty and love all of the vegetables in it. And it makes a lot of food - will definitely be freezing some. I will definitely make this again.

Tried this rcipe last night for the family. Everyone loved it. That includes one teen who avoids most veggies and on in his twenties who won't touch pasta in any form (so appreciated the potatoes). It is an unseasonably frigid and - yesterday-snowy winte here so I substituted my broiler for the barbecue grill. That probably deprived the dish of a small amount of "smoke" flavor that the grill would have added. Since I will Definitely make this again (and again) I can find out what the grill adds when the weather warms up here. Also used ground lamb which is what I ususally use to make moussaka. It would have been good with ground beef but I think it's better with the lamb. Thanks for the recipe!

A wonderful classic low carb Greek recipe. I don't have an outdoor grill so I broiled them 5 inches from the burner on a cookie sheet 10 minutes on the first side 5 to 7 minutes on the second. Before broiling i added 2 tbs olive oil 2 T Italian spice and a teaspoon or 2 of kosher salt and stirred the veggies in this. I halved the recipe since there are only 2 of us and it made 6 not 4 portions. the only other amendments were 3/4 teas of nutmeg instead of a pinch (I wanted the nutmeg flavor to come through better. Doing it again I would not halve the white sauce it is sooo yummy and it was a little thin when halved. Don't tell anyone but it is even good cold. This is going to be a go-to recipe for when I am making dinner for a group.

Finally! An eggplant dish that my husband thoroughly enjoyed! This was my first time making moussaka and I chose this version for two reasons - the potatoes and the grilling. Grilling gave the eggplant good body since mushiness is usually my husband's #1 complaint about eggplant. And the thinly sliced potato base just seemed like something that would work really well. I did not have any zucchini on hand and I was also out of feta so I substituted parmesan. Other than that I followed the recipe very closely. I did season the potato and eggplant slices with oregano while I grilled them. We really enjoyed the combination of flavors and my husband even agreed that he would enjoy having this recipe again. I love eggplant so this is a win-win discovery for me. Thanks for such an interesting recipe.

delicious! I cut it in half and we still had enough for 3 meals (for the two of us!) Instead of grilling the veggies on the outdoor grill, I cooked them on the griddle on my stove top...tastes even better the second time around.

Made it tonight and it was fab! The kids loved it more than Lasagne. Great recipe although I think the measurements for the milk are a bit off. I think I only used 2-3 cups of milk and it was perfect.

So the flavor of this was great. Reason I only gave it 3 stars is it was way too much work. Started at 3pm worked straight until 6. Way way way too much ingredients called for. One and a half zuccini is plenty. Had a whole extra plate piled high left over. 3 egg plants was fine 3 large potatoes was too much 2 would have worked fine 2 large tomatoes is more then enough i had tons left over. Also 7 tablespoons of flour is not enough to thicken the sauce. It turned out like soup. Double the flour and cooked longer. This dish has great potential but needs a lot of changes to the portions listed in the ingredients and you definitely need a sous chef unless you wanna feel like a zombie all day.
