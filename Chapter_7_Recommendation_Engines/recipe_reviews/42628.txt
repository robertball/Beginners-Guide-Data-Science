Excellent! I did not use mushrooms because I do not care for them and I used chives instead of green onions because my store ran out of green onions. This recipe seems to be easily adapted to different tastes and vegetables.

Delicious! I used a whole pita, spread cheese on half, melted it in the micro and then added the filling and sour cream.  It was really filling. One plus a side dish was more than enough.  Very good!!

Nice! Found it a little dry so I poured on a touch of Thousand Island dressing - delicious!

This is decent.  The entire family was willing to eat it.  I grated the carrot rather than slice it.

Perfect in every way, except the portions are way off - "serves 8" really serves just 2 people. Otherwise, awesome recipe and will make again!

These pitas are very unique...so many flavors going on in your mouth at once!  May be easier to eat if you cut the pitas into halves instead of quarters.  Enjoy!

My wife and I manage a private community and serve from 5 to 100 people at a setting. We frequently cook for our smaller groups.

We recently had one of our vegetarian families in and I went looking for some quick recipes and found your site.

I believe in letting the consumer do the reviewing and this is what I received after serving Pita Love for lunch today--"wonderful, great, wow, delicious, etc."

We served our pitas up with brocolli cheese soup, a vegetable tray, and macaroni salad. 

I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

Great job. And quick and easy to make.

I thought this was pretty good. A better lunch than dinner, though it was pretty filling. Unfortunately, my bean sprouts spoiled before I made this, and I don't like mushrooms or olives. With just the black beans, carrots, celery, green onions, cheese and sunflower seeds it was a good mixture, but I know it would have been better with the sprouts. Also, I used mozzerella instead of monteray jack. I think this would also be good with cream cheese instead of sour cream.

Really nice recipe. I did this using single whole wheat pita bread also from this site(just for my hubby, who absolutely loved it).the only thing I changed in this recipe is mozzarella for monterey jack cheese&dried chives instead of fresh (didn't have it).It still turned out so very good.Thanks a lot ajia.

Simple, healthy & delish! I didn't use mushrooms or chives, but added a little diced red onion & chopped green bell pepper. Also substituted the sour cream with low fat, plain yogurt. I love this recipe. A new favorite in our house!

This is impressive.  Two out of three kids ate a good helping, and my husband who usually detests vegetarian fare really liked it too.  And, like the other reviews said, it was pretty filling!  Yum overall!

I loved this recipe!  Only thing I did differently was substitute fresh chives for fresh cilantro.  The sour cream  really set it off. I will make this again and again!
