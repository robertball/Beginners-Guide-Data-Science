We loved this!  It was as good as one of our favorite dishes at a Thai restaurant.  No changes, except I used lime juice (instead of zest) and I baked it instead of broiled (30 minutes at 350) - delicious!!!

Yum! This was good, but next time, I'll add more lime or peppers (or something) to give it more of a kick.

Yummy! I could almost drink this marinade. I used only one serrano chile because of my husband and 2 year old. It was still quite spicy, but all three of us loved it. I am definitely going to try the marinade on shrimp and maybe tofu.

I have to agree with the previous reviewer - the lime/cilantro sauce gets pretty nasty, especially after you have simmered it for 5 mins. I managed to salvage the dish by adding some heavy cream (which, unfortunately, diluted the coconut flavor), and also snipping some fresh cilantro over it before serving (which, Husband said, made it a 4 star recipe) but I would not make this again. Thanks, anyhoo.

I tried this recipe with 8 thighs too.  I doubled everything for the sauce except the sugar because I like gravy and so did my guests.  It was GREAT.  It is so easy because you can throw all the ingredients in the processor rather than chop it by hand.  I was running out of time to grate the lime zest, so instead a squeezed the juice from one lime into the sauce - it was really quite good.  My guests and my husband RAVED about it.  Also, my broiler doesn't work, so I baked the chicken at 350 for about 30 min. after marinating (but boiling the sauce separately as the recipe indicates).

Really good recipe.  I marinated 8 boneless chicken thighs, instead of just 4.  Then, at the end, I added 1/4 cup of coconut milk and 1/4 tsp of soy sauce to the simmering sauce.  I will make this again.  Thanks!

This is fabulous.  I modified it a little- added some scallions and a little more ginger, and I used lime juice instead of zest, and I used dried cilantro instead of fresh.  I also added more coconut milk.  It was fantastic. Tastes just like it came from a restaurant.  Everyone loved it, even my picky boyfriend.

I am not sure if I bought the wrong kind of coconut milk, but this was not good at all. I would not make it again.

This recipe is amazing!  I was out of white sugar, so used brown sugar.  It was great.  My husband thinks this is the best recipe on this site!

I really enjoyed the sauce in this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly with the addition of one green onion and a chipotle in adobo instead of Serrano. After cooking the sauce off, I had to resist the urge to drink it up! It was so good! After the chicken cooked, I poured the pan juices into the sauce and cooked a little while longer. That made the sauce even better! Served it all with brown rice so i could use all the sauce. I'm not sure what people did wrong who didn't enjoy this recipe... I also don't understand the picture for this recipe because the sauce is a very dark green when finished.. Hmm. My next time making this will be with tofu instead of chicken! Thank you for this simple and delicious new sauce!

Made this last night and loved it!  My only complaint is that the sauce had a very strong ginger taste.  I'll be using a tablespoon of ginger next time.

As excited as I was to try this I was equally disappointed.  After reading the reviews I decided to marinate overnight which did give the chicken an infused cilantro flavor but the sauce - just throw it out, trust me, it was bitter and beyond saving.  We did save the chicken (which cooked beautifully under the broiler by the way) by adding a little butter and salt after placing atop white rice.  My boyfriend said don't bother trying this one again and I agree, he did eat it but...  I've had much better success with Cilantro Lime chicken by just marinating chicken in 1/4c olive oil, 1/4 cup fresh lime juice & cilantro (chopped handful) overnight then grilling.  You could always add chopped serranos for a kick.

This was good and easy. I didn't have sorreno peppers, so I used jalapenos. The taste was mild, but good. I will make this again.

The best recipe I have found on this site!  Delicious!  Just the right amount of spice.  I boiled some brown rice and threw in some of the left over coconut milk and a teaspoon or two of sugar and served the chicken with the lightly sweetened rice.  Perfect!

Great change of pace for when you are in the mood for spicy chicken.  My husband LOVED this recipe.  I exchanged the coconut milk for almond milk and it turned really flavorful.  I also used sugar in the raw instead of white sugar.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, but I decided to BBQ the chicken.  I boiled the remaining marinade into a sauce and served it over the BBQ chicken.  Turned out really well. Served with rice, and sliced avacado and tomato.  Will be making this one again very soon!

This has fantastic flavor and was fairly easy to make as well. My picky, spice-loving in-laws will really like this! Lots of flavor, and kind of an unusual combination of flavors!

This was great, I made a few changes to suit what I had though. No peppers so I used chili pepper flakes as well as extra coconut milk and some chicken stock. I then  boiled or poached the chicken in the liquid for 20 minutes (I used the breast) and broiled it in the oven for an additional 10. I reduced the sauce and added a little extra sugar. My boyfriend adored the sauce and I will definitely be making this again.

This was awesome.  Loved the sweet/spicy combination.  Served with cilantro rice and used leftover marinade as a gravy for the rice and chicken.  Thanks so much for submitting.

This was an excellent recipe. I made changes due to what I had on hand. I only had about a 1/2 cup of light coconut milk and jalapeno peppers and no lime juice. I had to use lime powder. It was the only thing I had and I was glad I had that. Due to lack of liquid, I added chicken broth to the marinade only when it was time to cook. I let it marinate over night and my son declared it was the best chicken he's ever had. We like spicy food. The sweetness of the coconut and the cilantro and lime were divine. Thank you for posting. I will be making this as often as possible, hopefully, with the proper amount of ingredients. I served this with Quinoa with Asian Flavors on this site to which I added chopped carrots and slivered toasted almonds. Good combo.

This pasta dish turned out to be surprisingly delicious.  It had many unusual, aromatics ingredients that I found oddly paired, but tasty.  I modified the recipe to include 2 jalapeños  lieu of serranos.  I also cooked the sauce and added it to pasta separately with additional crushed chili peppers, salt, and black pepper.   Served chicken on top. Looked beautiful.

pretty good stuff.  Very easy.  I loved the sauce... I'm considering making much more of the sauce to pour over noodles or rice and the chicken.

We enjoyed this dish. I try not to change recipes on the first try but sometimes ingredients or preferences interfere.  My biggest problems with almost all recipes is they do not have veggies in them. So, to incorporate some summer squash, and also because once long ago I was a saute cook in NY, I made some small changes.

First I sauteed summer squash in olive oil with onions (4 saucer squash and 1/3 of an onion) in olive oil after dusting with flour to coat.
Browned a little, then removed from heat and spread on half cookie sheet, placed in oven which was hot from another dish, but now turned off.
Added more oil to skillet, and then sauteed chicken with all marinade, covering for a bit to steam the chicken.  When sauce was reduced to a thick sauce, mixed in warm squash and onions. Plated chicken pieces with leftover rice and arugula covered with sauce (always double sauce- you will never regret it!), along with a warm white bean balsamic salad.  
It was very tasty!  Next time I will add a little salt, and a little lime juice at the end of the reduction.

I made a version almost the same as thins… I usually use 1 jalapeno instead of 2 Serrano peppers and only ½ tbsp of sugar.  I dice up chicken breasts and after marinating, put them on skewers and BBQ them over medium heat for about 5 min per side (I save a little of the marinade and baste them once when I turn them over).  They are delicious!  I usually use low fat coconut milk so it’s a really healthy recipe too!

Had some Costco Rotisserie chicken we needed to eat. Made the sauce, added some whole cream. Otherwise stuck to the recipe minus 1 pepper. Chopped the already cooked chicken and cooked/browned it with butter. Added the sauce and cooked for a few minutes. This dish is outstanding!!! I could pour the sauce over ice and drink it. Can’t wait to make it again.

This turned out great and has been added to our future recipes.  We used our home-grown, pickled peppers and lime juice but, other than that, followed the recipe.  Super good and I could see us using the same sauce with shrimp one day.

This is my new favorite recipe!! Although the sauce comes out nothing like the picture, it is definitely green, but fabulous!! The only things I did differently were that I only used 3 Serrano peppers when I tripled the recipe as we have a daughter that is sensitive to spicy things, and I used the light canned coconut milk instead of the unsweetened. Served it over angel hair pasta. We have a large family and everyone loved it! The prep was so easy since I made the sauce in my Magic Bullet, hardly any chopping required. Next time I'm going to try it with shrimp. I really don't understand the posts that talk about the sauce not coming out, I would encourage them to try it again.

I made this last night and it was delicious! I didn't alter the recipe at all other than grilling the chicken instead of using the oven. the marinade and sauce was delicious!  I doubled the recipe and had lots of sauce...yummy! I served it with tofu noodles

I made an alternative to this recipe because of what I had in the house.  no sirachi peppers,  used 1 T. sirachi sauce.  had thin chicken breasts, so I made the sauce and set aside, then browned the chicken with a dusting of flour.   once the chicken was cooked, I set it aside, turned the burner way down and adding the sauce to deglazed the pan.  after a few minutes added the chicken back in to pan to warm and finished with the fresh cilantro.   it was delicious.  served with jasmine rice.

I made this exactly except the first time I did lime juice instead of zest. Second time I grilled chicken breast on the barb turned out fantAstic each time.

This recipe was sooo good!  My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it.  Changes I made were:

1. Peppers (see below)
2. Topped with some scallions at the end (good, but certainly not necessary).
3. The photo shows pasta, but I used medium-grain brown rice (easier to absorb the marinade than the pasta).  It worked well--I would suggest white or brown rice instead of pasta.
4. Chicken breasts instead of thighs.
5. Squeezed the lime in the marinade in addition to the zest.
(The changes sound like a lot, but they are minor, and certainly optional).

For those of you who don't want anything too spicy, I would suggest using half of a jalapeno pepper instead of the two serranos.  I used one whole large (de-seeded) jalapeno, and it was still a bit too spicy.

Really, the spiciness was the only issue.  I'm not sure what happened with the folks who gave it one or two stars...

Such a great recipe! I'm Vegetarian and turn the marinade into a soup! I make it at least twice a month.

Excellent dish, and a great way to use up leftover cilantro.  I read through the reviews before starting, and decided to double the sauce recipe.  I doubled everything except the serranos and the chicken.  The result was a very flavourful dish with just the right amount of kick!  I used boneless chicken breast cut into 1-inch chunks, threaded them onto skewers and grilled them on the BBQ.  The result was fantastic!  We will definitely be making this again.

Delicious!  I put the chicken in a Crockpot and added all the ingredients without blending.  Cooked 5 hours, removed chicken and used an immersion blender to puree sauce.  Mixed the remaining coconut milk (leftover in can) with a bit of cornstarch to thicken, and added it to make more sauce.  Served it on top of homemade pasta.

Delicious,I stuck with the recipe as is.  I would recommend doubling the sauce if you're going to add pasta or rice to this.  Was too spicy for some, I will half the amount of serrano peppers next time.

I gave this 4 stars at first because, out of laziness, I used cilantro that came in a squeeze tube. Made it with fresh cilantro and it made a huge difference! I baked chicken breast and used only 1 pepper. I also used light coconut milk. Turned out great! I find that you have to constantly stir the sauce or else it will turn yucky. 

I served it with nasi lemak (coconut rice) and some sambal chili. IMO this side makes the whole thing 6 stars!

I can't believe I made such a delicious dish! My user name is Cooking Impaired for a reason! I have certainly impressed myself! I followed a review and only added 1 TBS of ginger root instead of 2 and it was still wonderful. This recipe is a keeper! It certainly does have a kick!

I really enjoyed this recipe - I left out the chilis since I don't enjoy spicy. My husband really like it, and he's a meat n taters kind of guy. I added half of the lime's juice, marinated it an extra half hour, and ended up adding a bit more coconut milk w.a  bit of cornstarch to thicken it up when making the sauce.  I will make this again!  A creamy, no dairy sauce is heaven!!
