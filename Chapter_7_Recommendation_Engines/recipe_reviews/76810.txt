The sauce was way too bland for Italian sauce even though I used all hot Italian turkey sausage.  After heating on the stove for about 40 minutes, I added 1 cup of coarsely chopped onion,  1 ½ Tbsp. minced garlic, 1 ½ tsp each of dried basil and oregano to ONE HALF of the recipe, and it tasted much more like I had hoped, though I think the ratio of basil to oregano needs to be tweaked.  I would also recommend frying the turkey sausage before starting the sauce because it was rather lumpy even though I took care to add it to the sauce in small raw chunks.

This recipe was a nice change from just regular spaghetti and tomato sauce.  My 8 year old loved it.

Excellent! Also works great to make a big batch, and freeze portions for lunches.

This makes a huge amount even if you half the recipe!  It was very good.  We liked the texture of the baked pasta.  Will definitely make again.

This was pretty tasty. I used mozzarella and cheddar. I just don't see how you can go wrong with that much cheese and italian sausage!

This is the only recipe that my significant other will eat onions in. It's the only red sauce he'll eat all the way down to the bottom of the bowl. Others, he simply leaves behind after the pasta is gone. Completely intrigued by the baked pasta base of this recipe, I had to try it. It's a keeper in my recipe vault.

This is my recipe.  The sauce WILL be bland if you don't let it slow cook!!  Cooking on the stove doesn't work to marry the flavors.  Please don't give me a bad rating because you decided to alter the recipe (pretty much changing it completely), and then saying you didn't like it.  I certainly understand that.  Please let it slow cook!!

I used straight garlic sausage and added Italian seasoning.  I also used shredded Parmesan and a bag of shredded Italian cheese. I broke up the meat, but it still could have been smaller.  In the end, the flavor was good but on the salty side.  Next time I’ll make sure to use straight Mozzarella.
