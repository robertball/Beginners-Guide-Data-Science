Loved the recipe, cut the apple ingredients in half and kept the dough as it was, then sliced the apples into quarters, making smaller dumplings and served it with ice cream. Everyone seemed to like this better.

Reminds me of grandmas apple dumplings! Dough came out perfect and the syrup was very easy.
I will be making more of these in the future!

This was the best apple dumpling recipe I have tried.  The dough was the easiest and the most successful for me.

This was very close to the one that my grandmother and mother used to make out of the Betty Crocker cookbook, but more complicated. Didn't use the food coloring. Tasty! Very good on a crisp autumn afternoon. The pastry works well for apple pie too.

This is a wonderful recipe! It tastes professional :)  Thank you very much for sharing it! I made the mistake of rolling out the dough on floured aluminum foil which made it difficult to lift up and just gather (i.e. the dough got stuck to the foil). So, using a baking sheet as the directions say is best. Also, I think that the syrup is on the sweet side but it tastes perfect when eaten with the apple and the dough :) I can see vanilla ice cream topping off this dumpling perfectly.

I reallly liked this recipe.  I made some minimal changes.  I used puff pasty (it was yummy!).  I sliced the apples rather than using a whole one.  Iused more brown sugar, and less white.  I also put the cinnamon, sugar, etc., into a baggie and coated the apples before baking.  They were delicious and so tender.

This is what I did: Made the dough the night before, cut into 6 squares, layered them between layers of parchment paper, refrigerated overnight.  Took them out of the fridge about 20 min before using. The next day, I made the sauce (Using Margarine, instead of Butter...and No Food Colouring), then I made the apples, using margarine instead of butter. Delicious Recipe!! Tip: I had a hard time getting my dough to be 12x18, so I rolled it as big as I was comfortable with, then I cut it into 6 squares.  Then, I rolled each square out 1 at a time, and made them as big as I could.  Much easier!

These are sooo wonderful. I suppose I'm a little biased because I love apple dumplings, but these are a lot better than some of the stuff I've tried

I love apple dumplings, but this recipe was disappointing. The big issues were:  1.) The sauce was not good.  It could've been a cinnamon-y  flavor carrier, but instead it was like a gelantinous overly-sweet goo. It need cinnamon and nutmeg badly.The red food coloring made me feel like I was eating melted candy. Not good melted candy, either. 2.) Unless you're looking for a biscuit-type of consistency, this pastry was much too soft.  The biggest reason is probably that there's just too much baking powder in this recipe. If you use this amount, that salty, almost carbonated flavor you'll taste is leavening. I'd use 1/2 tsp. if I made these again. 3. I felt the baking time and temp was off. I used Jonathan apples and they were still very firm after 35 min. while the pastry on the bottom of the dumpling was still slightly doughy. Maybe trying a higher baking temp (400 for the first 15 min and then 375 for the last 15) would make the apple nice and soft and the pastry crispy.

I've tried SEVERAL apple dumpling recipes and this is the keeper. So delicious and so easy!!  I had some store-bought refrigerated pie crusts on hand, so I used those instead of making my own crust, but next time I do want to try this crust recipe.  It looks so easy. These dumplings are loaded with flavor. Coating the apples with the dry cinnamon mixture is key. It sticks to the apple.  (Other recipes have you pour a syrup on the apple, which basically runs down and sits at the bottom.)  I did made the mistake of only using half of the syrup to pour over the dumplings, thinking that it would make the crust soggy, but the syrup actually carmelized during baking, so I used that to drizzle over the ice cream that I topped the dumpling with.  Soooo good.  Next time I'll utilize all the syrup to have more for drizzling.

Excellent recipe…a must keep.  You will need to double or triple the pastry dough.  I also halved the apples.  The syrup was the highlight of the recipe.  It is an easy one as well.  The dumplings came out beautiful and crisp.  With the excess syrup in the pan drizzled on them, they were beautiful and tasty.  A nice recipe for dinners.  Thank you!

I'd suggest a couple of changes to make this better: First, use only half the syrup or the dough will get too soggy and float away...or use a larger pan (maybe my fault was that the pan I used was smaller and so the liquid rose higher.) Pre-poach or slice the apples so they will cook by the time the dough browns. I also had to use very small apples or there wouldn't have been enough dough to cover. Next time, I will double the crust recipe to get extra scraps to make leaf cut-outs for decorating. The flavor is very good, though. I liked this recipe. Nice flavor.

The pastry was good but I wasn't impressed with anything else. I didn't feel that I really had enough dough to work with which ended up making the fillings overflow in the oven and made my entire house fill wtih smoke. The filling was not sweet enough and overall didn't have a very good flavor. The syrup was also much too runny. Will not make again.

These dumplings are very good and easy to make...the pastry is very tasty,flaky and light.  I put 1 egg yoke and about 3 Tablespoons milk mixed and brushed over the top before dusting with cinnamon sugar mixture on top of dumplings and poured the sauce just into the bottom of the pan before baking. I did as others suggested and cut Large green apples from my orchard into quarters used less and kept the dough recipe the same...made about seven nice servings.  This recipes a keeper!  Thank you Beverly

Thanks for sharing this recipe. I had fun making these with my 11 year old step son. He kept telling me how much he loves brown sugar so I told him we could stuff the inside of the apples with rasins, chopped pecans and his favorite(brown sugar). I did a horrible job coring the apples...lol. I need to buy an apple corer. It didn't matter. The dough held the apple together perfectly anyways. There was even left over dough for Christan to play with and we baked it up with sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on top. I used butter flavored crisco. I also omitted the nutmeg just because I am out. These were delicious served with a bit of homeade vanilla ice cream. This kid is never going to want to go home now.

Wow! This looks JUST like my little old grandmother's recipe.  I haven't made it so this isn't exactly a review, I just wanted to add that we always used to eat these fresh out the oven with extra syrup and cold milk poured over it.  The milk gives it that little bit of creaminess without adding extra sweetness that it really doesn't need.  Try it, its phenomenal!

Thanks for this one! Despite the pastry being a tad delicate to work with (I'll use my mom's pie crust recipe next time), it was just like what I had in Pennsylvania Dutch country years ago.  Been searching for something close ever since.  Keeping this one!!!

My grandma used to make dumplings with a pie crust type pastry, and that's what the taste i was looking for.  This recipe is more like a biscuit texture, and although it was still good in flavor, it wasn't what I wanted.  I quartered my apples, to make better serving sizes, and would roll them in the cinnamon-sugar mix.  I would cook them at a higher temp for a shorter amount of time next time.  I also felt like the syrup needed to be doubled if you want some to serve over the ice cream.  I was worried the syrup was going to be runny like others had said, but it thickened up plenty after baking.  I enjoyed this, but will keep looking for a more pie-like crust.

The pastry was much more biscuit-y than I expected, but it tasted oh so good--especially with the syrup baked over it.
Not having apples, I used 3 peaches--cut in half, peeled, and sliced--then fanned out in a pretty way inside the dumpling.  Son's allergic to milk so we use a vegan-friendly "butter" spread and soy milk.  Also, I only used half of the syrup when I poured it over the dumplings before baking so I'll probably only make half as much syrup next time.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I made it exactly how the recipe stated and it tured out divine.  I served it with a little bit of vanilla ice cream.  The sauce was slightly thin, even though good.  For those who like the sauce thicker, cut the sauce recipein half.  Everything turned out perfect!

These were okay. Followed the recipe almost exactly. We cut the apples into pieces but there were still way too many (probably only need 4 apples). I can't imagine the quantity of dough would have covered an entired apple. Maybe half of an apple. Also it seemed like there was too much cinnamon. The syrup was a nice touch, but the dough was only okay. I'll keep the syrup part of the recipe but totally revamp the rest.

I didn't use any nutmeg, butter with the apples or the red food coloring.  I added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the syrup and used ice water in place of the milk.  I doubled the recipe and made tweleve dumplings with 3 apple slices, 1 tbsp of the sugar mix, and a caramel in each.  They were a big hit!

This is the recipe from Better Homes and Gardens original cookbook.  My Mom made these while I was growing up and now I make them and so does my daughter.  Best recipe for Apple dumplings but I've also used the very same recipe and used fresh peaches.  They were great!

My kids are woofing these down, my son, who won't touch apple pie loves these.  This was so much easier than I thought it would be.  The crust is exceptionally easy to work with.  Took others suggestions and cut apples in half, and increased the crust by 1/2- ended up with 11 halves covered.  Used all brown sugar,as suggested by another reviewer, and increased apple sugar/cinnamon, rolled the apple in mixture then put a tablespoon of brown sugar-cinnamon in apple cavity,put about a 1/2 tsp of butter on top of that(1/2 tbs seemed like it would be way too much) put flat side down on square and folded up, put flat side down on baking sheet.  Only used half of the syrup, which I poured only on the bottom as per another reviewers suggsetion.  Came out nice and crispy, not soggy as one would suspect after pouring the syrup on the bottom.
We'll definately have these again.

I made this w/Granny Smith apples.  I followed several people's advice and quartered the apples - - this made them manageable and the servings were more realistic.  Plus, there was more crust to apple, and let's face it, that's where it's at!  The crust is very light and delicate - - different from your average "pie crust", and I would definitely find many more ways to use it.  Oh, and the syrup was heavenly.  I skipped the food coloring, and I think it was that much more appealing.  Bon Apetit!!!

This is a 5 if you either double the pastry or halve the apples.  I cut 6x6 squares as the recipe said and a whole apple just wouldn't fit!! so I used half an apple in each square.  It was perfect! In future I will use half an apple because the apple to pastry ratio was perfect when cooked.  This is delicious!  The syrup is yummy!

This is the BEST apple dumpling recipe! I've made them 3 times this season. I live on an apple orchard and I've tried them all. My only recommendation is to use Northern Spy apples and double the recipe. You will not be disappointed!

If I could, I would give this recipe more than 5 stars.  We've made about 400 of these so far for a Boy Scout fundraiser, and these have been a huge hit.  We are selling them at $3 each or 4/$10 and we've had lots of people coming back for more.  They are huge and wonderful!  Excellent recipe, DH even likes them better than the ones his mom made, and that's saying something.

Thanks so much for the recipe.

VERY tasty-but my apples were too big for the amount of pastry, so I ended up cutting the apples into pieces. Next time I will double the pastry.  I made this for my son who LOVES apple pie and he claimed it was the best he has tried. My husband (who hates apple pie) just devoured this!

Great tasting dessert despite the fact that my presentation was pretty poor.  You want to make sure you can do this recipe from start to finish interruption free.  Between the phone ringing, neighbors dropping in, and children running around I threw the apples together in a hurry and didn't pinch the dough enough around the top.  Another thing, make sure you use an apple corer for this.  I though I could just cut the apple in half and scoop out the core.  NO GOOD!  2 of my apples drifted apart in the pan and fell over making a soggy crust as the result.  Also, I only made a 1/2 recipe and though I would just use a 9X9 pan.  Too much juice accumulated at the bottom making the crust a bit soggy.  Overall, the taste is great.  Kinda like your own personal apple pie.  Of course serve with vanilla ice cream.  I will try this again because it did taste very good even though it looked pretty bad!

Yummy....I diced my apples and mixed the spices with them before placing in the dough, more like little turnovers.  I also made a brown sugar/vanilla sauce using 1 c water, 1 c brown sugar, 1-2 tsps vanilla, and 3 tbsp butter.  I simmered the sauce until it boiled down a bit to thicken, and ladled it over the hot dumplings before serving.  Top with vanilla ice cream and voila!  Note that dumplings are best when eaten straight from oven..they get a bit soggy if stored.

This is excellent!  I packed my apples into a oval corning ware dish.  The sides of each apple almost touching. Then I poured the syrup over them and in between the cracks.  This made them very syrupy and gooey. Yummy.  One of my favorite recipes.

Excellent! Next time I might use smaller apples and let them bake a little longer, but the sauce was excellent. We served these with vanilla ice cream. My daughter was mad that I had never made apple dumplings before!

I used puff pastry after trying this recipe. The dough/crust wasn't what i wanted. I love the flakiness of a apple dumpling and didn't find it here. The sauce and spices were fine, everyone tweeks it to their own liking. 

All in all, puff pastry did the job for flakiness,  the other sections of the recipe was a guideline.

Very good! I even liked the sauce and I'm not a big nutmeg person! I found that the easiest way to get the pie crust onto the apple is to first roll the dough between two bread sacks and then to lift the bottom of the bread sack and press it onto the apple with the dab of butter. The sack will peel away leaving the dough.  I gave this one less star though because I couldn't get the sauce to thicken--it was more like juice. So I stuck the sauce back on the burner and boiled for almost 30 min until it would foam at the top even while stirring. I also served with ice cream and caramel sauce. Great recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe. The Granny Smith apples I had were large enough that I just cut them in half instead of using a whole apple. I skipped the butter in each dumpling. Baked for 45 minutes & they were perfect.  Great flavor. Tart yet sweet.  Nice crust. Will definitely make this again.

These were awesome!! They are as good as the local county fair (and that is saying a LOT). The only thing that would make them better is making the pastry myself (I cheated by using pre-made pie crusts... not good with pastry). Love the syrup topping. The second time around I halved the apples/pastry to make smaller servings; this worked just fine and the still came out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe... I never knew apple dumplings could be this easy.

Great Grandma gave me a list of ingredients for her recipe but no directions.  I guess she assumed I KNOW something about baking.  This recipe helped me recreate great grandma's dumplings and my husband and kids couldn't be happier since great grandma has given up baking.

I definitely recommend serving these warm out of the oven with ice cream for a nice contrast. 
I planned on making these with an entire apple and leaving it whole.. but as I was making it I decided that it would be much better to slice the apple up a bit and use a little bit less. It just would've been too much.  Also, I didnt think the syrup was quite thick enough..nor do I think the food coloring is necessary. just use brown sugar instead of white, it will give it better flavor anyway.
I wanted to add raisins and chopped walnuts to the dumpling but I forgot, so I just sprinkled it over before I served it.  Came out great and everyone loved it, I would use this recipe again.

These are the best apple dumplings.  We tripled the dough and halved our 6 large Granny Smith apples for 12 dumplings and almost ran short on the dough.  Also doubled the sauce and used half brown half white sugar.  Next time I will try adding chopped nuts and raisins to the apples.  Worth all the time and effort.

This is an awesome recipe.  I used hybrid gala/granny smith apples that I bought at Sam's Club.  They were perfect.  Just the right size, texture and flavor.  I also keep my shortening in the fridge.  This makes for such a nich pastry crust.  I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe.  I will definately make this a regular winter/holiday treat at our house.

My husband & I own a small sandwich shop and I decided to try your recipe. I made 36 of your dumplings and in two hours they were all gone. They are the best and the pastry is wonderful. That is why i tried them because I wanted to try a new pastry dough. AWESOME APPLE DUMPLINGS.That means alot in Pa Dutch Country.

My dad loved it.  So did I.  I was trying to find a receipe like my boy-friend's mom makes and this was the closest I found to it.  Except we eat it as a breakfast cereal with milk instead of cream or ice-cream!

I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception - I used brown sugar instead of white only on the apples, (kept white sugar for syrup).  Next time, I will definitely use smaller apples or make more pastry.  I made the pastry very thin, and still didn't have enough to cover all of the apples that I had.  The pastries did stay together well though.  I didn't have any break open during baking.  It seemed like this made a ton of syrup, so I only used half while baking and the rest to spoon over just before eating.  A good recipe, but I may try a few others to find the perfect one.

This was a good recipe, I would prefer less nutmeg, i would rather taste the apples more than the spices.  Since I wanted to make these for more than six people, I chopped the apples and mixed them with the sugar and spices.  Then I spooned them on to the pieces of the dough and folded it over like a pocket.  They turned out perfectly.

this is a great recipe! i didn't end up with that much crust so i only put half an apple in the little squares i made. i baked them at 350 until they were lightly golden brown and then reduced the heat to 300 because they were pretty close to the top rack for another 15 minutes.

I thirded this recipe so my calculations may have been off somewhere, but nonetheless, these apple dumplings were SO good.  I "rounded" each measurement of cinnamon and nutmeg, just as a taste preference for more spice and didn't use the food coloring (the spices were enough natural color for me).  I made 3x3" pastry squares and wrapped it along the bottom of about 1/4 an apple (I didn't see how I could completely enclose a whole apple even with a 6x6 inch square) for a more individual serving.  It baked in the oven for about another 3-5 minutes for the apples to soften a bit more and to allow the syrup to thicken to an almost slimy, gooey consistency.  After taking it out, I poured the surrounding syrup over the dumplings.  They're even good cold--the syrup is thickened and the apple taste it more defined.  I'm sure they would be great with ice cream, though.  Such a tasty recipe!

These were really good.  I even messed the dough up a little and ended up kinda piecing it onto the apple slices, but it still turned out great.  We were worried that the syrup would make them too sweet, but they were perfect.  No leftovers!

Very Disappointed!  The crust of this recipe is not what I was looking for, or IMHO what anyone would want in a good apple dumpling recipe.    Wouldn't even make a good pie crust in my opinion.  Not flaky all, and not much taste either.  I took other reviewer-advice and doubled the crust recipe and had to roll out really thin to get even that to cover 6 large fancy apples.  I put this in a 9x13 glass dish, and the sauce amount was fine for the baking, but had NONE to spoon over the top or drizzle with at serving.  I didn't care for the cinnamon mixture for the apples either, It wasn't sweet enough, and was almost bitter.  We didn't even finish eating these. I've never done that with an apple dessert before, (it's hard to ruin any apple dessert) and I've been baking for a LONG time!    I'll keep looking for a more delicate-crust dumpling recipe.

these were a HUGE hit with my in-laws and friends! used pillsbury premade crust, cut each in half and rolled into a square for each apple. didn't use food coloring and added a little brown sugar for the glaze. i basted them throughout the baking and before re-heating after dinner. they were amazing!

This was delicious! Nice balance of apple taste, spices and sauce. The changes I made were:  Didn't use red food coloring, substituted 6 layers filo dough unbuttered per dumpling for the pastry, 1/2 of a Braeburn apple instead of a whole apple. Next time I would like to try the pastry, but  last night I was determined to make them like The Machine Shed's. It came out pretty darned close. We poured some of the baked sauce over the dumpling before serving as well. Yummy!

Yummy!  I made this following the directions to a T.  I however thought it needed some improvements.  So the second time I made it I made some changes.  The pastry to me was a pain to roll and once it was baked wasn't quiet what I expected it to be.  I used half butter and half shortening for the pastry and then stuck it in the fridge for about an hour.  This one step made such a difference!  I cut the apples into chunks and cooked them until just tender with water, sugar and cinnamon.  I cooled them before using them.  Oh and I made more of the sauce because there wasn't enough for everyone to pour a little over the dumpling and icecream.  Anyhow, I thought this recipe was worth tinkering with so thanks for posting it!

Simply delicious!!! And the easiest pie crust I've ever made. I substituted I Can't Believe It's Not Butter for butter and used this and Canola Oil in place of shortening.

Oh man.  These were yummy. Used 1 & 1/2 times the dough, and cut 4 large apples in half to make 8 dumplings.  Omitted the food coloring.  These were oh so good!

I am a culinary student and used this recipe for a project.  What a hit!  My chef instructor and classmates loved it!  I made a second batch of the syrup, added a little heavy cream and made it into a caramel sauce.  Thanks!  This will be made again.

OK, I don't know if I should be rating this recipie because I made so many changes, but here goes.  These were very good! I chopped the apples into peices and put the seasonings on them while I made the crust.  I used the Best Ever Pie Curst recipe from this site.  And I didn't make the sauce to pour over the top (Hubby wanted a more "apple pie" like dessert:-)  And although I want to try the sauce for the top next time- very yummy!

Amazing.
I had the same problem as other reviewers, though, it didn't make enough dough to cover even a medium sized apple
I used 1/2 whole wheat flour for a heartier crust which turned out well.

This recipe was incredibly easy to make.  Everyone loved it; literally, no complaints.  My only complaint is that I should have put it in a deeper pan.  My pan was only about 3/4".  The lower depth allows for the syrup to harden making it more difficult to distribute on the finished product, and more difficult to clean, blah!  I will make this dessert over and over again.

These were great!!! I took the advice of the other reviewers and used small apples. I microwaved the peeled and cored apples for about two to three minutes and put about one tsp. of raisins in the core of each apple. The dough was just the right amount for four small apples with just enough scraps left over for cut-outs. I baked the dumplings in the syrup, which I made with brown sugar and thickened with one tsp. of arrow root and one tsp. of water. The pan I used was large enough to keep the syrup  at the base of the dumplings. I basted the dumplings with the sauce while they baked and served them with ice cream. We all loved them! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

These dumplings were fabulous!!!  I have made apple dumplings before, but this recipe beat all the past ones.  I was out of white sugar so I used brown sugar and it made a caramelly-type sauce which was so good it was hard to save it for the dumplings.  The pastry dough was very easy to work with and turned out flaky and light.  I used small, green apples as they are alot easier than using the big ones.  Excellent recipe!!!

Though I've finally come to the conclusion that I must be the worst dough roller ever, this came out great.  Next time, I will double the dough recipe because I needed more to wrap around the apples...again, it was no fault of the recipe, I'm sure.  This tasted just like the ones my Mom used to make.  I LOVED THEM!

Recipe calls for too much milk for the dough.  I had to add more flour.  The pastry around each apple sank to the bottom of the pan. Worst apple dumpling recipe I've ever used.

I made the recipe exactly as written only doubling the dough and cutting the apples in half to try and feed all my coworkers. They turned out amazing! My coworkers had them all gone within an hour and are already asking me to make them again. I think they needed more apple to me so next time I want to make sure I have enough apples to use a full apple for each one.

It was the first time I attempted to make apple dumplings, and I found it took much more time than it does to make an apple pie.  The results were very good, but there is not enough dough, and I had to roll it very thing to cover the apples, which made it very difficult to work with.  It is a tender dough, even with using lots of flour to roll it..  I bumped up the measurements a third for the dough on the second batch, and that worked much better.  (3 cups flour, 3/4 cup milk, etc.)  I also stuffed the hollow center with a teaspoon each of raisins and brown sugar before putting the pad of butter on top. The tip to put the spices in a resealable bag to toss and coat the apples one at a time in it was a good idea, too. I baked them at 400 degrees for the first 15 minutes, and reduced the temp to 375 for the remaining  23 minutes.

Used too large apples so I had problems covering the apples with the crust.  Still tasted great!

This was so good!  I made this like a roll (like a pumpkin roll) instead of individual dumplings I diced the apples and rolled out the dough and put the apples on it and the placed the entire roll into a 9 x 13 dish and poured the sauce over all of it.  There wasn't enough dough to cover the top  of the apples and there were lots more apples than would fit into the roll.  Even so dumped I all the apples and sauce in the pan.  It wasn't pretty, but it was delicious!  Next time I might make more dough to make it look prettier, but even if I keep it as written the proportion of apples to dough was correct. I did not use the food coloring.

Oh my!  This is a very nice recipe but it is imperative that the dough is doubled!  My apples are not that large, I even trimmed the bottoms off, but I still do not have near enough dough to cover the apples.  I don't have time to make more dough, so I followed through with the recipe and will cross my fingers that they are edible.  They smell delicious and I love the texture and work-ability of this dough.  Will make again sometime but will double this dough.  I only gave three stars due to the dough shortage problem.

I have made this a few times, and I don't know if I will again. I cannot get the crust rolled out large enough to both hold together and wrap over the apples. Even when I use portions instead of whole apples, I have had trouble. Also, it is wayyy too much syrup. And if you pour it all in the pan, bake, and let cool, it will turn into a rock.

I had some leftovr apples I wanted to do something with before they went bad, and this was a great recipe.  The dough was a little difficult to work with and I may try some changes with it in the future but the Dumplings were a big hit!

These were delicious and turned out great. The only time-consuming part is peeling and coring the apples. But it was well worth it. My husband was impressed.

Love it, Love it, Love it!!!!  I've used this recipe many times and have even made it for the in-laws 2 Christmas' ago... big hit, although some of the old timers thought it was too sweet.  Very filling.  I usually make extra apples and freeze them for later use, that way all i have to do is make the syrup and bake em. The hubby LOVES em!!!

Thought this was a really good and tasty recipe.  But since it is 800+ calories per serving  I made some changes.  I omitted the TB pat on the dumplings and only used 1/8th of the syrup. Hopefully that will decrease some fat/calories! I had plenty of pastry dough for 6 dumplings. Turned out tasty and pretty!

I had leftover pastry dough so I decided to make this, my company really enjoyed it.  Wasn't fussy on the syrup, would like more of a caramel sauce.  Would definitely make the dumplings again.

Amazing recipe! Amounts of ingredients need to be adjusted a little bit. We only put half of an apple in each dumpling instead of a whole apple, we also needed more dough there was not enough for 6 dumplings in the recipe. Also the dumplings were definitely not as pretty as in the picture the dough was very bumpy and was not at all neat. However, it was a crowd pleasing recipe and everyone LOVED it!

My husband and I had fun making these; but we need some practice!  I would recommend using an apple corer to core the apples instead of cutting them in half to core them; our apples ended up falling apart while they baked.  And our syrup caramelized in the oven and wasn't edible.  Still, very yummy taste.
