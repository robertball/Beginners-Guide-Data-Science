This recipe could not get much easier. I made for my husband and he LOVED it! I can't wait to make it again. Just be sure to clean your leeks throughly as they like to hold dirt!

Great recipe!
Used real potatos and potato starch instead of potato flakes also used soy milk!  Turned out great!

We love this soup.  It is tasty and easy.  We have salad and fresh french bread and cheese on the side.

I love leek soup.  I added about 2 cups of leeks and I added frozen hash browns instead of the potatoe flakes.  I also used some cream I needed to use to make up the 4 cups of milk.  Everyone loved it.

Wonderful flavor.  Used a scallion/onion mixture to get a little garlic flavor.  Although the texture is a little grainy because of the potato flakes, this is would be very adaptable to home dried potatoes or even left over mashed potatoes.  Excellent for a lower fat version of a great comfort food.

We really liked this- there was none left at the end of the meal! I used 1 leek, 1 can of chicken broth, & 2 t. dried parsley. Easy, quick, & economical! Thanks Ruth!

I made some changes to this recipe to suit what I had on hand and it turned out to be one of the best soups I've ever made...and that's saying something!  I only used one can of soup broth and used the empty soup can to measure out 5 cans of skim milk.  The biggest change was that I substituted the potato flakes (yuck) with my left over scalloped potatoes from Easter dinner.  (they were and Asiago cheese and sage recipe).  Anyway, I threw them into the boiling mixture, mashing as they cooked.  I then took out about 3 cups of the leeks and potatoes that hadn't dissolved and blended them.  Put everything back together and dined on the most delicious soup!!!  I think the secret was definitely the leftover scalloped potatoes.  They lent an unbelievable flavour to the soup.  I will DEFINITELY make this again; in fact, every time I have leftover scalloped potatoes!!

I like this recipe, but usually add a clove or two of garlic, and in addition to the potato flakes (which add both creaminess and flavor), I also add a 'real' (pre-cooked and diced) potato or two to add some chunkiness.

Great starter recipe.  I added real potatoes and blended the onion, leek and potatoes once they were soft.  Added more chicken broth, salt and some garlic and only about 1/4 cup instant potatoes.

This was such an easy soup to make. The first soup I've ever made.  It was very flavorful, and filling. I did chop up some real potatos and put them in the soup for some chunkyness.  Maybe if you make this soup I wouldn't add as much potato flakes.  It got really thick, it almost was a watered down paste.  I like my potato soups not so thick.

Loved this recipe. Will be keeping it! Super simple, and super easy to expand upon depending on your own nutritional needs.   Sorry, I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but was still pleased with the end result. No potato flakes, but instead real potatoes thinly sliced. I also used no milk. So at the end, when all the potatoes and other ingredients were tender, I used my hand blender to puree them.   Turned out smooth and creamy, without needing any milk. Garnished it with shredded cheddar cheese although I think low fat sour cream would also be a lovely addition.

This was a very easy recipe to put together. Everyone liked it. I used garlic salt instead of celery salt and didn't add any additional salt.

I must have read the directions 3 times, wrote them down, re read them, and then proceeded with the soup. I ended up with a pot full of leeks, onions, potato flakes, and curdled milk chunks. (the milk was not bad beforehand I checked).   I don't know what happened but  I will not be trying this again, and am sadly disappointed with wasting my money on ingredients for something I can't eat.  sorry.

Stir frequently so that soup does not stick to bottom of pan. Also, use a rather large pot to prevent boiling over. Learned this the hard way !

This recipe is very good as originally written, and easy to make. For a heartier version, last time I made it, I fried four strips of bacon, cooked the leeks and onions in the bacon grease after removing the bacon, and drained the mixture. I chopped the bacon and added it, along with about a half cup of shredded carrot. I brought the broth to a boil and simmered it for a couple of minutes before adding the milk.

Good soup, although I made a lot of modifications. I used new potatoes to sub for part of the potato flakes, and used coconut milk plus some water for the milk. I also added a little black pepper and a couple teaspoons of garlic powder. I added about half a bunch of kale about 10 minutes before serving

Perfect & easy. I added 1/2 cup of cubed frozen hash-browns (about 3 minutes before serving) and 3 slices chopped browned bacon. I got leeks this past week from Bountiful Baskets and had never cooked them before. I googled a recipe for leeks and came across this. My husband and four young kids DEVOURED it!

This was delicious! I used half goat's milk and also sautéed some mushrooms and put them in after the boiling stage (but it would have been just as delicious without the mushrooms, I'm sure). I agree with whoever said that fresh potatoes might be a bit better because flakes are ever-so-slight grainy, but it's so much easier this way. I can't wait to get home tonight and polish off all the leftovers. yum yum yum!
