This was excellent!  I doubled the garlic, soy sauce, and balsamic vinegar for extra flavor.  I will definitely make this again and again!

Didn't have fresh basil but did have some pesto that I had prepared with fresh basil.  I too thought that the hummus needed more oil to spread well and I also added a tsp or so of lemon juice to brighten the fresh taste.  Blended in feta cheese by hand before serving.  I took this to an office luncheon and received compliments.  Will make this again once I have an abundance of basil from the garden...

This is absolutely delicious, especially served on a slice of homemade french bread!!! I did have a few changes to the recipe, however. First of all, I did not have any balsamic vinegar on hand, so I used red wine vinegar instead. Secondly, while pureeing the mixture, it became very dry, so I added water until it was the desired consistency. Other than those two changes, the recipe was fantastic! I made this for Christmas, and everyone loved it's amazing flavor!

This is a basil hummus.  This needs quite a bit of liquid added to this in order to get it to blend to the right smoothness.  I like the taste of the fresh basil, but this hummus needed some work.  I did end up adding a dash of cumin and a good amount of lemon and a tablespoon or so of tahini.

Yum! This is a fantastic hummus-type dip that whips up in about 5 minutes. Over time I have made some adjustments to suit my particular tastes: I add 2 cloves garlic, 3 tablespoons olive oil (this makes it very rich, and gives it a great texture), 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar, and 2 teaspoons soy sauce. I also add a few squirts of lemon juice. The most important advice I can about this recipe is to make sure you use a *packed* 1/2 cup of basil. Measure the basil until it fills the 1/2 cup totally packed down. This gives it the perfect basil-y flavor!

This was good and quick. I do agree that lemon juice is necessary. Served with celery and carrots, was a yummy & healthy option next to the other high-fat appetizers that I served.

Delicious, unique hummus.  I had some fresh basil to use up and this was a great use for it. Like other reviewers, I added some lemon juice, plus a little extra oil and water to achieve a smoother texture.  I also added a dash of hot sauce for a little added dimension. Thanks, Dan, for an easy and tasty recipe!

This was soooooo good!  I added more olive oil, one more clove of garlic and the juice of a whole lemon.  I loved the garlic and basil flavor in this hummus!

Awesome!  It was gone in a day.  I eyeballed all the ingredients, didn't measure exactly.  Would be great to mix and match different herbs and seasonings...I'll definitely be making this again very soon!

I made this for a bunch of people who had never tried hummus before and everyone loved it!  I used fresh basil and a little more oil than was called for and it was perfect! We served it on garlic toasted pita.

I wish that I could give this waaaaay more than 5 stars! This was by FAR the best hummus recipe I've ever encountered and let me tell you, I live, eat and BREATHE hummus! I was incredibly skeptical at the lack of tahini paste, however, this hummus didn't need it one bit. Also didn't ned the lemon juice people commented about.  If you're looking for a little more "zing" simply double up on the soy sauce and basalmic. If you find it too dry, add some water (tastes the same, no calories!)  Thanks for an incredible recipe!

Only 4 *s because my husband said it had a funny aftertaste.  I  think it was the basil.  But I loved it!  Then again I like basil more than he does.

I don't have a blender or a food processor, but that's okay! I love a chunky, thick hummus. I thought the liquid measurements were perfect. It was a very unique combination of flavours. Delicious on some toasted crusty bread with a side of tomato soup.  As a hint for those also mashing this by hand or with limited tools: do not chop up the garlic. Take a small plastic bag (for sandwiches, for example), put in a clove of garlic, and smash that sucker until it's nice and pulpy. Mashed/pressed garlic carries a stronger, fuller flavour than chopped garlic.

I think this is a good idea in theory, but not the best recipe.  I ended up adding extra basil, garlic, and olive oil, plus some lemon juice, parmesan, and pine nuts.

I bought a bag of pita chips and needed something to dip them in. Plus my basil plant needed a bit of a trim. This recipie was a winner! I had all the ingredients on hand and it whipped up pretty quickly. There is definitely not enough liquid in this recipe, though. I put in closer to 4 or 5 tablespoons of olive oil and twice as much balsamic and soy, and still streamed into the food processor probably close to 1/4 cup of water. (I never measure anything..) I also added a splash of lemon juice and some red pepper flakes because as written, this is definitely missing *something*. I am definitely happy I decided to make this, it was the perfect dip to my chips.

Great recipe!  I love both pesto and hummus.  Just add a little extra liquid and make sure your food processor is up to snuff.  Serve with pita, chips, or celery sticks!

I made this exactly as written and found it extremely bland. I'm used to more traditional tahini-based hummus with parsley and lemon juice, but had a lot of basil to use up and thought I'd give it a whirl. Ended up adding some tahini, cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and extra basalmic, and the end result was better, but still not my favorite.

You have to add liquid for this to work and it's quite bland.  Lemon juice helps a lot.

This was so unbelievably easy and it came out delicious.  I added a dash of extra balsamic vinegar because I love the zing it provides.  Serving this tonight with a sliced baguette, and a caprese salad made from home-grown tomatoes, home-grown basil and my first-ever home-made Mozzarella cheese.  I think it will be a perfect summer supper.

I was never really into hummus before but thought I'd give it a try. I wanted something a little healthier to snack on. I'm glad I decided to try it. I can't wait for my husband to try it, he loves when I make new recipes and I know he will love it. I will definitely make this again!

I have to say I was iffy about making home-made hummus. I thought it wouldn't taste that good but all I can say is WOW! I've never been able to eat more than a pinch of hummus because of being allergic to citrus (lemon, lime, etc). I left out the vinegar, pepper and salt, but added fresh pesto. Since I didn't have any vinegar at home, I just added more olive oil until it was at the consistency I'm used to. My dad likes hummus and his face lit up when he tried it. Thank you for sharing this recipe! IT'S AMAZING!

Wow!  Had lots of basil from the garden and was in the mood for humus which lead me to this recipe.  Did it exactly as outlined, but garnished with lots of fresh diced tomatoes from the garden as well.  It was a hit.  Gobbled up within minutes by spouse and kids within minutes.  Kids want to make more to take in their school lunches.

I needed a quick dish to bring to a picnic, and happened to have all the right ingredients!  Like many other reviewers, I doubled the vinegar, soy sauce, and EVOO for more flavor and smoother texture.  And being a pesto freak, I used a packed full cup of fresh basil.  OK, so I didn't follow the recipe exactly (I hardly ever do), but thanks, fantastic dan, for combining these two fantastic spreads!!   BTW, I made homemade tortilla chips to go with this ... yum!!

I have another favorite hummus recipe but was looking for a different recipe to incorporate my prolific basil.  This is amazing!  I stuck pretty close to the recipe but added a little water & tahini to loosen the texture a bit.  I'll be making this again!

This was a great hummus!!! I actually added 2 tsp garlic,2 tsp olive oil and doubled the balsamic and the soy sauce. It was great but you have to double it for a bolder taste if thats what your looking for. But overall- nice!

I had a huge amount of fresh basil from my herb garden, so I thought I'd try this out.  So glad I did!  Wonderful flavor!

Very easy and tastes great!  A bit lighter than some that I've made.  I added a tbsp of veggie broth to help mix it up.

I bought the Sabra hummus from Publix and added the extra ingredients and it tastes great with  salsa chips  or pretzels. I am trying to replace the expensive "Bitchin Sauce" I love getting at Mother Earth Natural Foods store.  I liked this.

Didn't have fresh basil, but I used about 3-4 heaping tablespoons of pre-made pesto and it worked perfectly.  This recipe needs liquid and acid so I used a lot more vinegar and olive oil than the recipe called for and added some water and plenty of garlic.  Absolutely yummy!!

This was my first attempt at making hummus.  I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I skipped it.  I added a splash of lemon juice, and some paprika (because I love paprika!).  I think I added a lot more olive oil than 1 tbsp because it seemed awful dry.  Overall it had a really good taste!

Love it! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I squeezed half a lemon into it. I make hummus a lot and this one's definitely a keeper!!

I added a bit more garlic (because I love it!), a bit more oil and vinegar, and a tuch of really hot water to soften it up just a bit.  I can't wait for my friends to try it for our Canada Day celebration.

Very nice, but a bit dry... consider adding some more oil and/or actual basil. Tasty!
