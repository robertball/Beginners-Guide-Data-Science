I've been making over night refrigerator oats for the past year. I make several individual portions to last a week.First off, they won't taste like cooked oatmeal. They have a chewy "organic" texture which we really like. The variations are endless. I've used : almond milk, regular milk, toasted nuts, peanut butter, raisins, chopped apples, bananas , various berries, coconut, Chia ,flax , even sunflower seeds, plain & flavored yogurt (Greek is the best).  Most of the time I don't use sweetener, I find the fruit to be enough but if not , Agave or a little  brown sugar work well. Great, easy, healthy breakfast or snack.

Fabulously healthy , quick and easy. Since finding this recipe I've been making it every day for my kids' breakfast.  I use almond milk and   switch out the fruit every day so these little pots always harbor a surprise in the morning :-)

Made for my wife to grab and go in the morning.  It is easy to make. She says oats are to chewy may add more milk next time or a longer soak time in the refrigerator.

I love this recipe! I made a few changes because of my dietary restrictions. I used almond yogurt and I actually already had frozen mangos. I liked it with maple syrup (Québécoise here) or fresh dates to replace honey.

Hated it!  I either made it wrong or I hate cold oatmeal. Maybe if it was granola. But I'm sure it was me?
