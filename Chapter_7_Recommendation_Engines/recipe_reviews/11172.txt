I'm not sure how real sugar cookies are supposed to taste, but these tasted REALLY good especially out of the oven. It was easy to cut the cookies and none broke, but I froze the dough for about 4 hours though. And I baked them for about 8 minutes instead. Also, the sprinkles and cream that we used to decorate the cookie stayed on without problem. I would definitely recommend this recipe. 

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it wasn't the best tasting one.

This was a terrrible recipe.  My husband spit his cookie out, his brother fed it to the dog and my was told if I made this for my daughters class, I would be the most hated Mom in the history of kindergarten.  They were more like a bread/dough then a cookie.  I don't know if the salt is wrong and should be baking soda or powder, but this recipe as it is, is not good.  Try another one, save yourself the effort.

I used this recipe for a stoneware cookie mold.  After the cookies were baked, you could not really see the image I molded into them.  I ended up using the rest for spritz cookies and those came out okay.

Not sure what other reviewers' salt issues were (perhaps used salted butter, maybe misread teaspoon as tablespoon...), but my batch came out just fine. A bit bland, as others noted, but if you're looking for a cookie to decorate with frosting and sprinkles, you probably want a neutral palette with which to begin. Just be sure to refrigerate the dough thoroughly, and it helps to stick the cookie sheet back in the fridge after cutting to let the dough re-harden.

This was the best sugar cookie recipe I've used! I followed the directions almost completely. (I didn't have any of the required vanilla and I didn't refrigerate the dough before making the shapes) and it came out perfect! I also didn't put the dough into the cutters, but did it the old school way and pushed the cutters into the rolled out dough, easy peasy and deeee-lish!

Cookies came out just the way I like them.  Easy to cut and soft when done baking.  They're a little bland, but decorating them with frosting and sprinkles makes them taste just right.

I enjoyed the light pastry taste these cookies had. They had a delicate hint of sweetness to them. I did not chill the dough for the two hours as suggested, and the cookies were fine. I didn't make a frosting for them either because the flavor was very satisfying on its own.

Cookies were pretty good. The consistency of the dough made it hard to roll it into a sheet and stamp out the shapes... you really do need to follow the recipe and put the dough into the mold. It kind of makes it slow to shape all of the cookies, and hard to keep them all the same consistency. The taste is pretty good though.

These cookies are delicious! My mom and daughter had a baking day and made these as a substitute for refrigerated cookie dough. They melted Candy Quick and dipped each cookie. They added some all natural sprinkles.....oohh! So yummy!

They're pretty good if you reduce the salt and add frosting.  They're somewhat like shortbread in flavor, but NOT texture.  They are very dense.

If you want a plain sugar cookie, don't go for this one.  It's not very sweet or flavorful.  (though it might be good with a touch of almond extract . . .)

Just what I was looking for!  Nice and simple (preparation and taste). I added a tiny bit more flour to firm up the cookies and help them maintain shape.

the 4 stars is because when i first started making them, they were impossible to get off the counter in the shape that you wanted, but after adding about 1/2 cup of flour, they were much better. could use some more flavor... maybe some more sugar? or frosting? but they seem to be pretty decent.

Yum!  They turned out great.  Instead of putting on frosting, I sprinkled them with powdered sugar which was easy and tasted wonderful.

Super good!!!! I didn't mold them so I didn't put them in the fridge. If you are looking for regular circle cookies these are the best. But to every thing good there is something bad. I left them out for an hour and a half and they got hard like that!!! I  threw them away, and had to make new ones. They were to hard to even eat!!!!! Hope this review helps you future bakers!!!

Really great recipe.  Easy and delicious.  You'd have to really mess up the simple instructions to not have these cookies turn out fabulous.  They even worked with whole wheat flour for me, but I reduced the baking time to nine minutes,

It was great!  I accidentaly forgot to add the salt, but the batter tasted great, not too sugary, and not too salty.  I will probably use this recipe again. I left it in the fridge for two hours and it tated awsome when I baked them. I recomend to add a bit more flour after refridgerating it.

very dense and dry with a semi-sweet almost almond flavor. The only way they worked was as a tea cookie. I had to dip them in the tea.

Easy recipe that worked out well, but I omitted the salt.  I just didn't sound right to me.  I also ended up adding additional flour, but they were pretty good!

The dough tasted salty, but I didn't notice a problem in the baked cookies. These sugar cookies are perfect for decorating, but if you prefer a stand-alone sugar cookie you may wish to use a different recipe. The "slightly bland" flavor will be an excellent base for the sweet decorations.

These cookies were perfect!  I don't know what the others are talking about.  They don't taste salty at all.  Those who think they do must have put in a Tablespoon instead of a teaspoon.  These were great and my husband loved them!

My first time making sugar cookies since I was a kid. The recipe was easy enough to follow, but make sure to use a LOT of flour when you are rolling out the dough. It was very sticky even after being refrigerated for 1.5 hours. 
Taste is OK, not great. I would probably make these again, but perhaps add more sugar?

Meh, these are edible but not good.  They do taste like shortbread cookies.  I think you need to add at least a half cup more sugar.  They are also very dense.

I love these cookies!  I'd call them "butter cookies" instead of "sugar cookies" because they are more like shortbread.  I used a teflon mold where you bake right in the mold and they came out great.  Thanks!

Good cookie, but isn't exactly your "traditional-tasting" sugar cookie.  Similar to shortbread cookies in some way.

Made this recipe before reading the reviews, and honestly do not understand why some people gave these cookies such a bad review. they are basic tasty sugar cookies and my 4 year old son loved making them with me, decorating and eating them.

Just made this with my 4 year old and he loved it. We added 1 more cup of sugar and 2 more cups of flour so that the it wont be too sticky. My four year old had fun mixing, cutting (w/ a train shaped cookie cutter) and decorating the cookies. The result, we had cookies that had the texture and taste that resembled animal crackers than sugar cookies. This recipe is great if you're making cookies with kids!

I never had a problem with the taste of these cookies, but the consistency threw me off. After I refrigerated the dough it was nice and firm, but as I was cutting my molds it turned very "mushy" and they were hard to cut. Overall a good recipe. For those of you who had salt issues. I use salted butter, but then do not add in the salt that the recipe calls for. Make sure you are not adding more salt than you should, because that can definitely make a big difference in your turn out.

I just tried this recipe. I admit I just used it since it's simple. Obviously it won't turn out as well as cookies made with shortening or tartar included in the recipe, but they came out fine. A bit dry but, thats how mold cookies are I suppose

My husband gave me a thumbs up!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Farm fresh eggs and butter were room temperature. Made two batches.  Will definitely use this recipe when I make my Valentines sugar cookies.  

It helped reading everyone's advice.  Room temperature egg and butter seems to be the secret for me for a darn good sugar cookie.

I cut sugar in half and oops forgot the vanilla but was terrific! Still held firm great. I used the tips and tricks I saw online to roll out dough between wax paper and put in frig then cut and bake. Worked like a charm!!!

They tasted pretty good. We made them into a cake and just cooked it all as one. It would have tasted better with something like icing, but still pretty good. Doesn't really taste like normal sugar cookies.

I liked these cookies! I saw the comments about them being salty so I used only a quarter tsp. of salt and I used salted butter. Even with that they were a little salty but not bad.  I also used a tad more sugar and vanilla, and then covered them in chocolate. I would definitely recommend the chocolate! :)

I made Halloween cookies with this and let the kiddos decorate them. They held together nicely and weren't too sweet so the icing wasn't competing. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was ok. I think that there should be less flour because the dough was so crumbly! Also, more sugar. I made these for Easter and my family seemed to like them. I added sprinkles on top to decorate.

Liked it. Success. Tried it with canola and added a little lemon in for more flavor (couldn't really taste the lemon), though it was still quite nice.

If you are absolutely craving sugar cookies or have promised to bake sugar cookies, DO NOT use this recipe. I was very disappointed when my cookies did not come out right! I spooned mine out onto a cookie sheet instead of doing cut-outs, and they maintained the "spoon shape" and did not flatten at all! They were extremely bready/doughy and had a very bland taste, and I even doubled the amount of vanilla extract (which has never ruined any recipe I've previously used). Like previous users have posted, they would probably be better if dipped in tea, or even coffee.

These cookies are terrible.. I followed the recipe to a "T", although I did let the dough sit refrigerated overnight, they came out more like doughy biscuits rather than sugar cookies. Christmas is coming soon, no time to remake a new batch... We are going to call these cookies "Tea Biscuts" so no one will laugh at our incredibly crappy sugar cookies! lol. In summary: This is a good recipie ... as long as you do not want a cookie that is in any way close in reference to a sugar cookie.
