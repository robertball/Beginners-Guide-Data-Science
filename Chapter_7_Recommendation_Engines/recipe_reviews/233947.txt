This was fun, delicious and a great play on a caesar salad! I used 'The Last Caesar Salad Recipe You'll Ever Need' for the dressing, and I only had Italian bread, so I went with that. I wasn't sure hubby was gonna like grilled romaine, but he loved it...I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great twist on a Caesar salad, HappyGrandma!  We love grilled romaine and I'm glad I finally got around to making this recipe.  The bread had great flavor and I made 'The Best Caesar Salad Dressing' from AR to use on this.  DH informed me we could have this 'quite often' this summer, as we do grill romaine a lot.  Served this with grilled pork loin and homemade mac n' cheese.  This salad was our favorite part of the meal.  Thank you!

I like this concept but it was a little tricky to eat. Make sure you slice the bread thin enough or it gets touch to  cut into.

I loved this!  I made a low cal Ceasar dressing (EVO, lemon,  garlic, small amount of finely grated Parmesan) and  used it to brush the bread before grilling.   I had left over steak which I slivered up and added to the top of the “salad”.  Lastly,  I closed the lid of the grill and let the steak warm slightly and Parmesan petals soften.  I drizzled each piece with remaining dressing.  Fabulous!
