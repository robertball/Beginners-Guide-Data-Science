I made this with our homemade applesause that would be considered "chunky". All the apple butter experts in my family have given it rave reviews and have come back for more.  Great recipe.

This recipe didn't work for me.  It turned out runny and bland.  I dumped it outside.  :(

It was very simple which was nice. I could have done something incorrect but it did not thicen as much as I would have liked although the flavor was pretty good.

Has a great flavor...did not thicken as expected and cooked it longer..don't know if I stirred it too soon, and I left the lid off of the pot, but did not thicken as it said.

I made it as shown and it was runny. I doubled the recipe minus the apple juice to my first batch and then it thickened nicely. The flavor was awesome and everyone I gave it to raved about it. I would recommend cutting the apple juice in half or eliminating it altogether.

As I type on November 17, 2017 9p, my quarter-batch has been simmering for four hours and hasn’t thickened as much as I thought it would/should. I used natural applesauce, orange juice (because I didn’t have apple juice), 1/2 c sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger (no cloves in the house). I can’t uncover it because it’s popping all over the place. I’m sure the taste is great, but why won’t it thicken?!?
Edit: I just tasted it and the flavor is on point. I can’t imagine adding all the sugar the recipe calls for. A quarter of the eight cups is 2c. Gah!

Since my last review I have made half of the sugar with Dark brown sugar and It gives a pleasant added dimension of flavor. Making another batch right now.

Never thickened....BUT saved the day by cooking some fresh apples in the "liquid", a few pulses in the food processor and all was good! Everyone loves it

I really liked this recipe.  Mine too didnt thicken well but I had unflavored gelatin packets and poured one in and it worked just fine.
