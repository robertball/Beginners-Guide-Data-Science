I made this as written only subbed fresh oregano for dried. It was delicious and filling. The only thing I would do next time is add another cup of sliced mushrooms. Will definitely make again

I made it for Thanksgiving and it was delicious. I left out the garbanzo beans and mushrooms because some of my family don't care for those ingredients. It was very easy to put together.

Two stars because: (1) the 30-minute prep time seems a bit optimistic. I'm an experienced cook and have done my share of peeling/chopping and it seemed to take more than 30 minutes. I got two yellow squash in my "Imperfect Produce" box. I had never used yellow squash before so wasn't sure if they would be small or medium. I used one for this recipe. I also didn't know if it was standard practice to peel yellow squash and the recipe directions were silent so I simply scrubbed the squash and sliced it. I didn't have a zucchini in my Imperfect Produce box but had a cuke which appeared to be an English cuke so used that instead. I had bought a butternut squash--never used one before. I only used the neck part of the squash. I pared that--it was difficult because the shell was hard and thicker than cukes carrots etc. I planned to use the bottom of the squash also but it was so hard to cut in half that I decided to just roast as is another time. The ease of preparation (or lack thereof) is definitely a consideration when I rate a recipe and was a factor in this one. (2) I was disappointed in the taste--bland and indistinct probably because there are too many competing veggies in this. Even if this had an easy prep I would still give it two stars. It's something I won't make again. Years ago I had saved a recipe from Parade magazine (part of Sunday paper). It was Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Onions in Jean Carper's EatSmart column (and is on allrecipes)

I followed the recipe and it was just ok. I feel like some different spices could do a lot for this but I won t be making this again.
