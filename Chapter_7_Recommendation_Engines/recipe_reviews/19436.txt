Four stars as written, but not difficult to elevate to 5- star perfection.  First, half a cup of butter in the crust is excessive and I can only see that the crust would be greasy, just saturated with butter.  Half that amount worked well.  Second, when I ran the recipe by Hubs and asked for his thoughts he remarked, “Sounds like an awful lot of hooch to me.”  My sentiments exactly – not only a lot of “hooch,” but the boldly flavored coffee liqueur at that; 10 T. total!  Not wanting to take chances on a too boozy flavored outcome, I made some changes.  I did use the 6 T. of coffee liqueur in the chocolate filling (I used Kahlua) but I added nothing to the vanilla ice cream.  To the chocolate ice cream I added 2 T. of the more subtle Bailey’s Irish Cream Liqueur and skipped the Kahlua altogether.   The Kahlua/Bailey’s combination worked well together; a pleasant amount of liqueur flavor without tasting like a frozen cordial.  Also, this pie will only be as good as the ingredients you use – a homemade chocolate cookie crumb crust made with real butter, premium quality ice cream (Hubs did a fine job shopping for that for me), and fresh whipped cream.  I topped the entire pie with chocolate curls, then served each slice with a garnish of whipped cream, mint leaves and chocolate covered coffee beans.  This couldn’t be a simpler dessert to prepare and you couldn’t ask for prettier, more delicious results.  This may just be a redo for Christmas when the kids all come home!

This is one of the best ice cream desserts I have had in a long time. Its unique flavor is punctuated by the Kahlua. Everyone at my dinner party enjoyed this flavorful concoction. I used coffee ice cream and chocolate ice cream. This is definitely an adult dessert, so I had to make a separate cake without the Kahlua for the grandchildren. Thanks Arvila!

I loved it and our guests loved it. I used an Oreo store bought crust which made it even easier. I didn't have chocolate ice cream, so added chocolate syrup to the top layer of ice cream with the Kahlua. Watch out for that middle chocolate layer - it will get you. Perfect to take to someone's house - easy, impressive, yummy!

I am very proud because I made this pie with home made Coffee Liqueur and even made ice-cream myself. I used 5 ingredient ice-cream from this site, it makes exactly 2 pints, so I just added a couple of teaspoons of cocoa powder into 1 pint. It was even easier than with store bought ice-cream, as I didn't have to defrost it to blend in Coffee Liqueur. Very satisfying taste, though I would recommend using good commercially produced ice-cream for a creamier pie. And it is easy and impressive looking!

This was very good taste wise, but the liqueur causes the pie to not set like you would expect and it melts very fast. I will make this again, but without the crust and in a glass. It would make a great adult layered dessert drink.

Oh wow, this was quite good. I could not find chocolate wafers, so I used a pre-made chocolate crust instead. Also, instead of whipped cream on top, I sprinkled finely crushed Oreos. The crunch was a great contrast to the creamy ice cream. Will definitely be making again.

This is amazing! I used a store bought oreo pie crust to save time. I added a french vanilla kahlua to the vanilla ice cream and used a mocha kahlua for the choclate ice cream and choclate sauce. Not sure if the flavored kahlua made a difference in taste or not, I was just using what I had on hand. I added cool whip as a topping with a decorative coating of melted choclate. Will be making this again and again. Thank You for sharing!

I cannot believe how easy this is and so few people have tried this wonderful dessert.  By using a premade Oreo cookie pie crust and Cool Whip, this was a breeze to make for Valentine's Day.  We both thought it's one of our favorite desserts.  If you like mud pie, you'll love this!

My guests loved this.  Note that it calls for chocolate wafer cookies for the crust - not sandwich cookies, which I used with some difficulty.  I would recommend purchasing an Oreo crust as others did to save time.  The pie melts VERY quickly due to the alcohol content - but no one seemed to mind the softness of the filling!
