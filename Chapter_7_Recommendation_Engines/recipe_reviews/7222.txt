Could not be any easier.  I usually use about half whole wheat flour and the other half unbleached all purpose and leave out the onion powder for a tasty all purpose roll.  I love to make these earlier in the day put in a storage bowl and pop into the fridge.  About 30-45 mins. before dinner I muffin-tin the dough and after it rises bake and get hot rolls on the table just in time.

These were very good and so easy to make.  Most breads don't work well here because of our altitude but these turned out great.  Next time I may try using garlic instead of onion or maybe even a little parm. cheese.

Wow!  These live up to their name, and they're delicious as well... I've made them twice this week already -- one time for guests, even.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I used 1 tsp garlic powder instead of onion powder.  These rolls turned out so soft and very easy.  We couldn't finish them all at dinner, so I wrapped the rest in aluminum foil and they were soft the next day, too.

These are great! They look like muffins, but then when you bite into them they are like " mini hot fresh loaves of bread," crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I omitted the onion powder, because I wanted a plain more versatile roll. I also mixed the water, yeast, and sugar together, as another reviewer suggested, and let sit for about 5 minutes to help proof the yeast. To make sure they were risen enough I also let them rise both times an additional 10 minutes. Sitting on the warm pre-heated oven was the best spot. I got 10 bread rolls from the recipe. I definitely plan to make this again! Thanks, Marian Collins.

Hubby requested a "plain" yeast dinner roll to have with soup this evening and I am happy to have found this recipe. Very quick, very easy and exactly what we were looking for. Because we wanted a plain flavor bread, I omitted the onion powder. I also proofed the yeast with the sugar for 10 min. and then continued on with the recipe as written. The result was a nice light textured, lightly flavored roll that could be served for dinner, breakfast with butter/jelly or lunch, used as a small sandwich roll. As another reviewer mentioned, you almost expect a muffin texture because of the shape but are pleasantly surprised by the soft, yeasty roll. I know I will use this recipe often. Thanks for sharing!

4 1/2 stars! I was afraid to just mix all those first few ingredients, so I stirred the yeast with warm water & the sugar first & let set for a few. Then proceeded. These are easy & good! I think I will use onion salt & garlic powder next time. One minor gripe is that the tops got a little too brown....so watch 'em! Might put foil on top the last 5-10 minutes. Thanks!

This recipe was the first one I ever used making dinner rolls. Normally we buy them at the store and I decided this last Thanksgiving I was going to attempt making my own dinner rolls. They were so good I have been requested to make them again for our Christmas dinner!!
 They are easy to put together and takes no time at all to do, as a matter of fact these were the last thing I had to prepare for our dinner and they baked up great. These dinner rolls are so good they actually melt in your mouth.
 I wouyld suggest this recipe to anyone who has never tried making a bread item before as my case.
 Most bread dough calls for you to kneed it, this one does not and mixes in the bowl just using a spatula and devides easy.
 With different ovens the cooking time may be a little longer than 15min. it took mine about 20min but when they are golden on top they are ready and watch out they will go fast!!! Make extra!!

what a tremendous find this was for a quick dough recipe. I have used this for many different things. I make what we call bier rocks . It is browned hamburger with cabbage and spices, then you put the mixture into a dough shell. This is great recipe for that. I also subsitutied garlic powder  for the onion powder and made garlic bread to go with baked spaghetti. It is very good just making them into dinner rolls also. highly recommended

The recipe quite simply didn't work.  The dough never did rise.  My Thanksgiving dinner party went on without rolls.

This is my new fav. roll recipe. I put everything in the bread machine to mix. I added a bit of very finely chopped onion, dried parsley and minced garlic to make a more savory roll. Formed balls and put in a pan so they would touch. Put a little bit of melted butter over the top of each one. We had a dinner party and these rolls had RAVE reviews. YUM!

These were great! Yes, the dough is sticky, but I used two teaspoons you spoon the dough and it worked great! I used 1 teaspoon garlic powder instead of the onion powder and it tasted good and not overpowering. The rolls were light and airy. It is an easy quick recipe. These would be great for a first time cook. So far these are the best rolls I made. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Great tasting and really 'fluffy' bread.  I made this as a loaf in my bread maker instead of rolls and it was great!  Will definitely be a favourite.

What a wonderful flavorful roll. One of the easiest I have ever tried. They are perfect as is but for a different treat I added about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar and substituted garlic powder for the onion powder. Then, after baking I brushed on melted butter with garlic powder. Yum!!

These turned out great! I left out the onion powder and substituted 10 grain cereal for the potato flakes. Also set the oven at 375. They browned beautifully and tasted like something you would get at a restaurant - everyone loved them and I will definitely make them again.

Very sticky dough as written, but made it in the stand mixer so a little easier to clean up. I took a gamble and did not add extra flour.  It was very sticky to transfer to the muffin tin and I was afraid that I would deflate it too much, but all was fine. Delicious!

Very forgiving recipe. I made the recipe for 16. When adding the flour I got distracted and forgot the third cup. It didn't look right but since it was the first time I made it I figured I would stick to the recipe. After I cover and let sit for 20 minutes there was no way it was right so I stirred in the third cup and let rise again. Then soon this stringy mixture into the muffin tins. They were perfect. Nice crip bottoms and large popover type tops with a spongy interior which soaked up the herb butter I made to go with them delightfully. I will definitely be making these again.

Great dinner rolls--my family of 5 (3 sons!) ate 18 of them at dinner tonight.  I substituted garlic powder for the onion powder because that is what I had & it was tasty. After the first raising, I put my dough in a covered bowl in the refrigerator (I was gone for a few hours). When I got home, I put the dough in the muffin tins and then put them right into the oven--no time for the second raising and they still turned out delicious!

These rolls were a huge hit at our house. I was so happy to find something fast, yet homemade. I did use melted butter instead of vegetable oil and a small amount of garlic powder. These will be requested often!

These were delicious - I had my doubts as I am not the best bread maker :( - Only thing I did different was I used garlic instead of onion powder as I had none - Quick, easy and will be making these time and time again - Thanks

If you're in a BIG hurry, you won't go wrong with this recipe.  I wasn't in the mood for the onion flavor so omitted it.  It took less than 2 hours from mixing to the table.

I made these lovely little rolls tonight for dinner.  I am so impressed!  They went together in just a few minutes, rose nicely in 25 minutes, rose again for just 20 and baked up light, fluffy and beautifully browned!   The only thing I did differently was use only 2 tsp of yeast and proofed it with 1 tsp of honey before adding the rest of the ingredients.   The dough is quite moist and sticky, as it should be for nice light rolls, so I buttered the scoop I used to put the dough into the muffin tin and smoothed over the top with the back of a buttered spoon to make the surface smooth.  They were perfect!  I will definately make these again!  Thank you!.

Exceedingly easy.  I'm usually lazy and cheat by making my dough in the breadmaker, but I didn't with this--took 5 min.  I did proof the yeast, I guess just bc I can't get away from doing that.  I proofed it with the sugar and water, then mixed in the flour.  At first I didn't think I would need all the flour called for, but I did.  Perfect amount.  Bf did comment there was a bit too much onion flavor, but I might've had a heavy hand with the onion powder.  So easy that I can easily make it again and reduce the onion powder or put in minced onion and/or garlic.  Thanks!

Easy, delicious, and pleasing to the eye! I loved the ease of this recipe! As one reviewer pointed out, any who find this difficult must not be familiar with "normal" preparation of yeast breads. The only thing I did differently was I added a few shakes of garlic powder and a pinch of dried Greek oregano along with the onion powder. The family and I split two right out of the oven! I'm not much for using potato flakes in any fashion but I was wonderfully surprised at these results! And they photographed beautifully as well! Thank you SO MUCH Marian!

I really like this recipe.  It is quick as far as breads go and they turn out great!  We love them.  I double the recipe, sometimes triple; cut the cooking time down just a bit so they're not completely done and browned and freeze them.  Then when we want them with dinner I pull out enough for my family and pop them in a toaster oven to warm them up and completely cook them.  I leave the onion powder out, the first time I used it and didn't like it.  They're more like dinner rolls without it and I like to sneak them with jam.

These rolls are delicious! Changes I made: I used Smart Balance oil, garlic powder as others suggested. I also used flour until it was a dough consistency, so it wasn't something I "spooned" into the pan.  It took a little longer for them to rise because of this, but they were really delicious. I will definitely make again. Thanks!

We ate a few that night, but ended up throwing most of the rolls away.  They were extremely easy to make, but very dry and bland - I'd rather put more work into it and get a tastier bread.

I proofed the yeast with the warm water and sugar for ten minutes, the egg, melted butter (used in place of the vegetable oil, as I'm running low on vegetable oil until payday), and all the dry ingredients. I set it to rise in a greased bowl on my heating pad for an hour (this was really slow rising, it didn't double in a half hour), then plopped into greased muffin tins (about a heaping 1/4 cup for each roll?), covered them and set them to rise on my heating pad until they doubled. Right before baking, I lightly brushed them with a little melted butter. 400* for 12 minutes was just right. These were good--not my favorite roll but tasty nonetheless. It was easy, sure, but not any quicker than any other yeast roll. I think this would have been better with garlic powder instead of onion powder. Good roll, but the title is misleading, IMO. NOTE: Watch these in the oven, they do have quick minute or two where they could burn. I almost had that happen but I caught it just in time.

These rolls were excellent.  Easy and delicious.  The only change I made was to increase flour because I did not have potato flakes and I substituted wheat flour for a 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have to say that I was skeptical about this recipe, but I was mistaken! Very easy, very tasty. My family loved these dinner rolls. From the reviews, I thought they would turn out like a biscuit. They were light and fluffy. Dough is thinner than what I am used to, but do not let that discourage you. I doubled the recipe, worked fine. I made the dough a few hours before dinner, I let it rise for 20 min, then stuck in fridge. (it continued to raise in fridge). 30 min. before dinner, I stuck dough in muffin tins (sprayed with pam). Put in oven and poof, they came out beautiful. I will make these often.

These rolls were fantastic, quick and easy.  I did not have onion powder so I omitted the regular salt and used 1 3/4 tsp of onion salt.  They were light fluffy and very good.  A regular in my house when I don't have time to make the time consuming ones and maybe when I do!

Tried these tonight exactly as written and they were great.  I make rolls 3-4 times a week and have tried many recipes here and these are my faves so far.  Couldn't be easier.  Reminds me of sally lund bread.

I made these rolls last night to complement a stew. The worked nicely and I really like them. However, if you are making these rolls for the first time as I was, follow the advice of other bakers and exchange the onion powder for garlic powder instead. They're fine with the onion powder, it makes them slightly savory, but I really think they would have been sooo much better with garlic powder. I unfortunately am fresh out and could not make the exchange....

Definately quick! I was in a bind and didn't have time to wait the hours it takes for other rolls to rise. Fast and easy, I've made these several times and they always turn out  perfect everytime! I usually had plenty of unsalted sweet cream butter right when I take them out of the oven and they are amazing!!

AMAZING!!! Followed everything exactly but left out the onion powder. I saw many reviewers proofed the yeast first. I did not do this and it still came out perfect. The dough is sticky but just put a little flour on your hands when handling. I have made many bread recipes and this one really was QUICK and simple! Next time I make italian food I will try it with garlic powder and maybe some cheese on top. Perfect simple roll!

Yuk!  I don't change recipes the first time I make them.  Onion overpowered any yeast flavor.  They're easy to make, but...yuk!  No yeast flavor, texture OK, potao is no point because you're not going to save them.  Sorry...I hated this recipe.

Now THAT was some messy dough/batter.  Ugh, it was like working with hot, chewed bubble gum.  I wonder what I did wrong?  I added more and more flour, but didn't want to bake bricks, so I took a chance and made them anyways.  They were pretty darn tasty!  Was it worth the mess?  Jury's still out on that one.  I also found they didnt rise that much...maybe this recipe should have called for Quick Rising Yeast?  I noticed there was no step for activating the yeast bebfore mixing it in with the other ingredients, that's why I wonder about the yeast.  I omitted the onion powder too, but that was the only change I made...will probably make again, and I rated this recipe mostly on the results - some pretty tasty dinner rolls, all in all.

A bit more dense than a traditional risen roll, but that's to be expected. Still came out warm and soft, and tasted delightful with butter. For the ease and speed of the recipe, I could not possibly ask for more.

Great recipe!  For those who may be wondering, 2 1/4 t. active dry yeast = 1 packet.    Replace half of the AP flour with whole wheat for more fiber, and a change of pace.

PERFECT!!! So fast and easy and soft and chewy :). I think next time I'll add honey for a more sweet taste. They're so versatile.

Wow! I have spent the last few months trying every dinner roll recipe I could find looking for the perfect roll. I'm so relieved that my search is over. These rolls are perfect. I'm not sure what other reviewers did to their rolls to make them "biscuit-like" or "crusty" but mine turned out soft & pillowy just like I wanted. My family couldn't eat them fast enough. I used garlic powder instead of onion powder.

Very pleased with this recipe! As others suggested, I substituted garlic powder. I also replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup of oats to give the rolls more substance. Yum, yum! Will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing!

This is by far the easiest bread I have ever made, I learned how to make bread from my Grandmother, bread that took all day long, this was done by the time the rest of my meal was ready!  Excellent taste, consistency, and flavor!!  The Husband said that this was a keeper!!  I also added a pinch of dried onions on the tops of half of the rolls and yummy, thank you so much, now I can make delicious dinner rolls anytime!!!

These were very good but i think that 400 degrees was too hot. Next time i make them i am going to bake them at 350 and see how it works. i also used garlic instead of onion. it was really good. everybody at the dinner table thought they were the highlight of the meal.

My kids yelled,"OH MOM!!!!  These are so much better than the store!!!  I love these rolls because I just found out my baby daughter has milk allergies, this recipe is dairy free and delicious!!  They are just as tasty as the long awaited yeast dinner rolls, They really are done in an hour!  Most yeast rolls take about 4 hours!  I omitted the onion/garlic salt because I didn't think my kids would like it and they turned out GREAT!!!  Thank you for giving us some family friendly rolls for Thanksgiving and beyond.

Very good rolls.  I used some whole wheat flour as well as the white flour - about 3/4 white to 1/4 wheat.  Family loved them and they were so fast to do.  Nice to have yeast rolls in a hurry.

Easy and delicious! I loved the ease of this recipe! I was looking for an simple roll recipe I could give to my daughter who is not a cook. The only thing I did differently was I added a few shakes of garlic powder along with the onion powder. They were a sucess! Like someone else commented I'm not much for using potato flakes and I too was wonderfully surprised at these results! I did lower the temp  to 350 degrees and cooked for 25-30 minutes to avoid burning the tops that some complained about.

I will say i was a bit worried about this recipe, but I was very pleased how they turned out, they were crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.
They were very easy to make, but be very careful and watch them or they will burn, they only took 10 min.I like to bake them on a baking sheet, not in muffin cups.
This was the easiest bread I have ever made.
Thanks so much for the recipe.

Super easy to make with items on hand.  I only had herb potato flakes so these were herbed rolls.  I killed the yeast the second time I made them but the B'Friend still ate them up.  Easy recipe to try if you are afraid of yeast like me. :+)

These were awesome!  Quick and easy for me to make---and I'm not much of a bread baker. My husband, who is a superb breadmaker and always makes the bread in our house, gobbled these right up! Our kids loved them.  I did use a garlic mashed potato mix instead of plain potatoes and also still used the onion powder.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe . . . we will be making these often.

I loved this recipe.  It was truly easy and I had a great fluffly and light roll.  I liked that there was no shaping (which really cuts down on work) but the rolls were nicely rounded on top and browned just perfectly.  I omitted the onion powder because I didn't have any, and they were still very flavorful.  I would highly recommend!

This was a really good recipe.  I called for 2 1/4 cup of flour, but I could only fit in 2 cups. I wonder if the other 1/4 cup was for handling, because I did use it for that.  The recipe worked out beautifully.  The rolls were soft and when they came out of the oven I brushed them with butter.  Perfect addition to my meal and the family was so impressed with my effort.  They just don't have to know how easy they are.   I would not change a thing.

I love these! I always make them into cloverleaf rolls  by splitting dough into 36 balls, placing 3 balls into each cup of muffin tin, then drizzling a little bit of butter over them. I use about 2 or 3 tablespoons melted butter for the whole tray. I then cover and let rise for an hour or more before baking. When the rolls come out they are soft and yummy, they break apart easily, and they're already buttered!

fantasic roll.  Easy, took about 10 minutes prep, I just threw all the stuff in the bowl and mixed it up (used fast rise yeast) and let it do the work.  I used garlic powder instead of onion and used large muffin tins, so it just made 6, but that was perfect for us.  I had flavored mashed potato flakes an that worked too.  very good.. it will be a favorite at my house !

Tasty!  We omitted the onion powder and I'm glad we did, it let us be more versatile with spreads.  Very easy, just a little bit of waiting in between for the yeast.  Next time we'll double it, because they tasted so good the next morning for breakfast!

Delicious!  I do like to shape my rolls, so I pinched the bottoms together to make a smooth top.  I used half sugar and half honey and left out the onion powder.  I brushed the rolls with hot butter before baking.

Great recipe - I leave out the onion as others - the leftover rolls toasted in the AM with peanut butter aren't as tasty with the onion flavor!  :)  4/2012-UPDATE: I found "Quick Yeast Rolls" from this site - flavor is much better.  Recipe is easy to work with, they rise better for me and are more "bakery style" to me!

This is the best roll recipe I have found.  It's quick and easy.  These are the first rolls I've been able to make brown on top!!  Thank you for a great roll recipe that my family will treasure for years to come :)

I made these for Easter dinner and they were the best rolls i've ever had. I just started making my own bread and rolls and these were easy and quick. These are something that will be a regular in my home. The only thing i did that the recipe didn't call for was use an egg wash just before baking. It made them a little crispier on the outside but still light and fluffy on the inside! My husband and kids raved!!

I omitted the onion powder in order to serve this as a more versatile roll. Too bad there were no leftovers for breakfast. My kids at them all that night at Dinner. For anyone who is familiar with the "Throwed Rolls"  at Lamberts in Mo these are the closest I've ever found to the real thing, next time I'm gonna make sure to get molasses to serve with them.

Simply the best.  Super fast.  Easy to make (my 11-year old daughter makes them).  We have also used garlic powder (in place of onion pwdr) and really liked that.

This was an easy roll to make.  I loved how I could go on to cook other parts of the meal while these rose.  The dough does seem fool proof.  The dinner rolls had a great consistancy but they had no real flavor.  I will make these again but I will add more spice; like dried rosemary and cracked pepper; cheddar cheese and garlic; lemon and poppyseed.

Dipped in butter and put in casserole dish. I used garlic powder instead of onion powder. If I make these again, I'll omit the powder (garlic or onion) altogether. The dough was too gooey; I added another 1/2 cup flour to get to the right consistency.

I used garlic powder instead of onion powder like others suggested.  They came out nice and soft on the inside, but I think the taste was still a little off, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.

I made this to go with Shrimp Chowder from this site and they turned out wonderfully. I let the yeast sit in the warm water for about 10 minutes before continuing with the recipe. I doubled the recipe and got 26 rolls out of the dough. Baked for 14 minutes; will bake a little longer (2-3 minutes) next time. I used 1 tsp. garlic powder in place of the onion powder (picky eaters). Overall an easy and delicious recipe I'll be using over and over again. Thanks for posting.

Love this recipe for quick dinner rolls. I don't usually have mashed potato flakes on hand so I use oat bran instead. I also use 1/2 whole wheat flour to add some fiber. And I do without onion powder.

This was a fabulous recipe..I played with it just a hair.. I added 3/4 warm water then 1/4 ricotta Cheese. For the onion powder i mixed italian herbs/garlic powder and chili pepper. Also instead of making Dinner Rolls I made them the size of Buns .. After they cooled I took and froze them for my family. Good Job on this recipe!!

This recipe is GREAT! So easy and the rolls turned out great. I used naturaly bleached wheat flour and didn't find the dough all that difficult to work with as other reviews were saying. I made the dough earlier in the day and put it in the fridge untill dinner time. I do have to say I was surprized to see that the dough continued to rise in the fridge though. I cooked mine in a 350 oven for 12 min (I have a convection oven) and they were wonderfull!

My husband and I loved these rolls!  I made them and then put the dough in the refrigerator until I was ready to bake them.  Then I placed the dough in a muffin tin and let it rise until it was doubled in size (about 30 minutes) and baked them off.   I didn't add salt into the mix, instead I substituted 1 1/2 teaspoons onion SALT for the onion powder.  They were fantastic that way!   Will make again and again!!!

These were so great! I followed the directions exactly and they were wonderful; although, mine didnt rise to the top of the cups, they still turned out perfect. Made my house smell great too (i love the smell of yeast baking)! :)

I used this bread recipe as a bun for sloppy joe's. They turned out wonderful, and so quick! I was able to whip a batch up in under an hour.  next time I am going to add a little garlic powder in the mix as well.

very delicious and very easy. I substituted garlic powder for the onion powder and instead of using a muffin tin, I used a mini loaf tray. WONDERFUL! Just a suggestion on making them better when garlic mini loaves would be to sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top, and maybe even to use them as bread bowls for soups or stews!

We enjoyed these. I loved the concept of baking them in my muffin tin. I made these exactly as written with the exception of leaving out the onion powder as I wanted a dinner roll that went with what I was serving. The next time that I make these I will brush them with butter after I take them out of the oven. Good recipe, thanks for sharing. 09/02/19 Update: I made these again, leaving out the onion power, and cutting the sugar back to 1 T,  loved them!

I used this recipe as the dough to make runzas (bierocks) and it worked perfectly.  It is tastier and much less time consuming than the runza dough recipe I had been using.  I did the second rise in the bowl (since I wasn't putting it into muffin cups) and added some extra flour as I rolled it out.  Since some reviewers said the onion powder was overpowering, I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Excellent!

Delicious and simple.  I didn't have potato "flakes", as the instant potatoes I had was more like a powder (purchased from Costco), but it worked great.  I too, left out the onion powder as I wanted just a plain roll, but it is delicious.  I will make it with onion powder another time as I'm sure it will be great too!  Great reviews from guests as well.

The texture was super fluffy. I used quick rise yeast and they had no trouble rising at all. The dough was a little bland, though. I had even added garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, and some Parmesan cheese and they still didn't taste like much of anything. I guess they made a nice canvas for butter. I will definitely be adding more salt and more seasonings next time. They were really easy to make so I will be happy to give them another chance.

Has anyone ever made these not using a muffin tin? I'm thinking of just using a scooper and putting them on line to parchment paper and baking them. Any thoughts? Thanks

Very good rolls that were quick and easy to make.  I've never added the dry potato flakes to rolls before, but I'm going to have to try this in other bread recipes.

Awesome for as easy as it was. I didn't have anything except olive oil, so that's what I used, then decided that I might as well make it more Italian by going with garlic/ital. seasoning in place of the onion powder.

Moist, light tasting rolls. I subbed half of flour with white whole wheat, half the sugar with stevia, proofed the yeast as others suggested. Will make this again. Easy.

Have to give this 5 stars for the easiest rolls ever, even though I screwed up making them. I added 2 1/2 cups of flour by accident, thought my yeast was bad because it wasn't proofing, and put too much garlic powder in them, also dried onion, not powder. However they amazed me they are really good for such a speedy roll. My dough was not as sticky as other reviewers was (maybe because of the extra flour) and I was able to sort of roll them before I put them in the muffin tin. They also rose really well, and in the time indicated. Also, I only had bread flour so I don't know if that made a difference or not. For my oven 15 mins was right on. No burning at all. I have to remember what I did wrong next time so I can do it again, lol.

good and easy.  The muffin cup shape made us expect a different texture, so our mouths were surprised when the first bite was a nice roll texture.  Might try making them in balls next time, more work though.

Very good. In addition to the onion powder, I did add 1 tsp. of rosemary and 1/2 tsp. of dill. It's nice not to have to knead the dough. The texture was more like a heavier muffin than a light roll. I would make them again. It was a perfect compliment to the Round Steak Sauerbraten from this site.

Good, easy roll for saucy dishes.  I used garlic powder instead of onion powder.  The dough was pretty sticky but not a problem.  I accidentally let these rise the first time for over an hour and they still turned out fine.  I like the fact that this recipe does not require kneading!

These were delicious! I made these exactly as directed, except I doubled the recipe, and they were so good and very tasty! Although mine were done 5 minutes before the stated time, and ended up being a little too dark since I didn't watch them close enough. My fault, but they were still very good, and every single one was polished off in no time. I'm just going to check mine earlier next time, that's all, because there will be a next time, easily, thank you!

I had trouble with these rising, but I'm pretty much positive thats my fault-next time I'll measure out the yeast perfectly instead of just throwing in a pre-measured packet.  Other than that I wanted healthier/less elaborate rolls that would go better with my dinner so I replaced the potato flakes with oatmeal, subsituted the white sgr with brn, replaced the veg oil with applesauce, omitted the onion powder, and replaced one cup flour with wheat flour.  Despite my touble with these rising they turned out AMAZING.  I couldn't believe how well they turned out despite everything. They were sweeter than I expected and my guests left asking for more. Suprisingly light and very complimentary to any dinner dish-will become my go-to for dinner rolls!

I liked it because they were fast.  I also used quick rise yeast.  I used garlic powder vs onion and added dried parsley.  It wasn't bad- but probably would have been better for a sweet type roll...wonder how to change that.

These are not the best rolls ever but as far as a good but fast recipe it's great. I made them a few weeks ago and didn't follow directions, kept adding flour until they were more like reg. roll dough and my husband compared them to unleavened bread. (They really weren't that bad but weren't as soft as my reg. dinner rolls) Today I followed the recipe but reduced the onion powder to about 1/3 tsp since the onion flavor really didn't go well with our main dish. They were easy, light and yummy. Will definitely make again but won't through out the reg dinner roll recipe :-)

These were ok.  I like rolls a little more light and soft.  These are heavier and do have a different texture, but they're still good and great when you need something quick.  Unfortunately there were plenty left after dinner.  I tried one the next day and it was just bland.

This is the best and the simplest of bread rolls.  I increased the flour by 1/2 cup and they are perfect for clover rolls. I make them 2-3 times a week to have with dinner.  yummmmmmmy

So easy and delicious!  Everyone had more than one.  I could have had three but stopped myself at two:)  I used bread flour because I was out of all-purpose, so it took a little longer to rise in the second step, maybe 45 minutes.  I will definitely make these again!

These were okay.  The onion flavor was a little strong for me.  They were quick and easy, but they were more of a biscuit texture than a roll.  Nice in a pinch, but I probably won't make them again.

These were AWESOME.  I used garlic instant mashed, and will also use some extra minced garlic in it next time.  Everyone enjoyed them. I used an ice cream scoop to make sure they were all the same size. We'll be making these often!  It took exactly 15 minutes to bake. Great instructions.

For flavor I thought these rated a four but the ease of preparation earned them another star. The only changes I made to the recipe were to omit the onion powder. These were airy but they had a kinda weird texture...I'm assuming from the potato flakes. I let mine rise in the oven w/ the light on & they rose very high...then fell when I pulled them out of the oven to preheat it. ??? My hubby loved them & ate 4. Thanks Marian!

I really liked these rolls.  They were very easy to make, and it was great not to have to knead the dough or shape the rolls.  Next time I will probably do half onion powder and half garlic powder because it seemed to need some garlic flavor.  They do have a biscuit-y flavor/texture, but that seems to be the case with every quick yeast bread that doesn't get kneaded.

The rolls that saved Christmas! The relatives who were supposed to bring rolls to Christmas dinner forgot, so after seeing a room full of disappointment (rolls are a big deal at our table), I found this recipe and dug around my mom's pantry. She had all the ingredients on hand, and these bad boys were in the oven in exactly one hour. I doubled the recipe, and mom's tins yielded me with 21 rolls. These were a big hit! Recipe saved for the next time we need rolls fast!

Nice soft roll with a tender crumb. I made the dough into "knots", which makes for a prettier presentation.

These rolls were really good considering the amount of time they take! Will definitely make them again for those  times I dont have time for regular homemade yeast rolls. I substituted garlic powder for the onion powder, but next time I will omit that ingredient because the sugar gives it a sweetness that I don't care to taste garlic (or onion) with. Also, I needed a little more flour than called for and the dough was still tackier than most bread doughs. Oiled fingers helped with handling.

I've been making these for years. Love them. 

If you prefer to use a typical pan instead of the muffin pan, you can add flour after the first rise (just enough to be able to handle the dough). As long as you leave the dough "loose", they still turn out light and fluffy and yummy. 

(And the onion powder is optional, if you want the leftover rolls for breakfast.)

My family loved them, I added garlic in place of the onion because I was out of onion.  Did you know that onion and garlic inhibit the yeast, allowing to bread to maintain it's crumb even when it rises fast.  I also proofed the dough in the microwave, and it responded very well.

Turned out great but had me worried at first.  The dough did not rise and was very sticky.  It was my first time ever making rolls so may have been my fault.  I will definitely be making them again.

OK for a base recipe. However 3/4 tsp onion powder is way too much.  1/4 tsp is plenty. Let rise for way longer than 20-30 minutes. More like 3-4 hrs. It does make a fairly dense chewy roll but watch them closely they can overcook quickly.

Turned out nice. I think my oven is on the hot side. At 400, it turned a little more brown than I wanted next time will try 375.

I've made these many times. Super easy as far as rolls go, and people always compliment them. I usually leave out the onion powder because my son likes to eat them with jam. This is my go to roll recipe. Make a double batch.

I made these with garlic instead of onion powder but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Easy and tasty!  I tried this recipe because I didn't have enough time to make bread and  I'd make them again!

The texture is more of a biscuit texture. The flavor was good but I wasn't a fan of the texture. But they were super easy to make.

Sorry...these didn't work out for us.  They had a weird texture.  I omitted the onion powder and they were bland. They definitely were quick but that's about it.  My son who LOVES any and all rolls.  Took one bite and threw it away.

I don't know for sure what I did wrong, but these were heavy and were not light and flaky.  I wonder if my water was too hot.  The onion powder did not enhance the rolls at all.  I will try this recipe again, but will leave out the onion powder and will make sure my water is only lukewarm.

I've never made real rolls before and these worked out pretty well.  I only had garlic potato flakes to add which sort of overwhelmed the flavor of the roll but my husband ate 5 of them so he must have liked them.  I will make these again.
