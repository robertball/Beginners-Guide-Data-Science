I can't believe more people have not tried this wonderful slush! This same recipe I have made for at least 20 yrs. It is so refreshing on warm summer days and anyone who has had it, loves it! I shave off frozen mixture with a spoon and serve in a glass with just enough Sprite so that it is still slushy frozen. Mix and break up slush with spoon so Sprite is evenly distributed. Should be on the thick side. Gin keeps it from getting so frozen that you can't get it out, so don't leave it out. And yes, you can feel pretty darn good on these! Awesome! Thanks Johanne!

This was great!  Made it for a dinner party - everyone loved it.  I used Bacardi Limon Rum instead of Gin or Vodka.  Some people didn't know it had alcohol in it so beware and warn your guests!

This is a great alternative to the "usual".  We've had this recipe in our family for years - but with Amaretto instead of gin.  Try it!  You'll love it!

I've made this twice - the first time I brewed the tea too strong, which was a huge mistake.  The tea shouldn't be strong tea, although the recipe doesn't specify.  The second time I let it steep only about 3 minutes, and that was perfect.  I put in about 2 1/2 cups of gin, and it didn't seem strong at all.  Everyone at bunko loved it, even the woman who swore she didn't like gin.

We've made this recipe for years with 2 1/2 cups of rum, mixing it with Sprite to form a thick slush.  Great for hot summer days!

Great drink!!!  I served it at a Memorial Day party and everyone raved over it.  I also used Limon Rum and Sprite, as suggested by others.  I've already made it a second time!!! :)  I will always have a batch sitting in the freezer for a "ready to serve" drink available at all times!

This tastes like a DREAMSICLE or an orange push-up!  This was good, very sweet.  I thought the sprite made it too sweet.  Club Soda was better in it for that fizziness.  I did put in a cup of vodka ontop of the 2 cups of gin.  Everyone still asked if there was alcohol in it.  You really cannot taste the alcohol at all.  The biggest fan of this punch hates gin too!  Thanks for the recipe, it's printed and in my recipe drawer!

This was great and relatively easy to make.  I used 2 1/2 cups of gin, cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups and mixed with diet 7-Up.  Yummy on a hot day!

This was a very good recipe--my husband (who doesn't drink "girly" drinks) couldn't get enough of it.  I used frozen limeade concentrate instead of lemonade--it's all I had) and I used Smirnoff vanilla vodka instead of gin.  VERY GOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!

VERY refreshing! I made the substitution version using vodka and it was great! I tried it both using the lemon-lime soda and also using tonic instead. I must say I liked the tonic version better, not quite so sweet, but did enjoy both! Great for summer cook-outs and parties!

This recipe has to be frozen overnight. I did half the sugar and used 2 1/2 cups of vodka instead of gin. Very delicious! Very nice consistancy.

I made this for a family get-together at our home and it went over so big, that most people asked for the recipe. It is a keeper!  The only thing I changed was instead of using gin, I used vodka.

This slush was delicious!!!  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup because that was all I had and it turned out more than sweet enough.  I mix it with club soda or just eat with a spoon.

My only recommendation is to make 2 batches, because it was so good that 1 batch didn't last long enough.  Even my friends who swear they don't like Gin drank 2 glasses each.  Perfect summer drink for hanging out at the pool!

This is a great slush. I made a few minor changes. I used about 4 cups of the liquor, only 6 cups of water, and NO SUGAR. There is no need to add all of that sugar to a drink.

It is very good and I have made it many times.

This tastes awesome. Only thing I will change next time is to use less sugar. I found that when I added the lemon lime soda, it was over sweet, so with the recipe as is I use half lemon lime soda, and half club soda - then it's perfect on a hot summer day.

I made this for our 4th of July party  and it was a big hit. I substituted Vodka for the Gin and it was very yummy! When you add the soda, stir a little and you have a nice slushy drink. Next year I'm going to try freezing the mixture in ice cube trays for easier serving.

Now this stuff is good! I used way more gin than 2 cups, and also used Splenda instead of sugar. We topped it off with sparkling water - white grape, and kiwi/strawberry. Very refreshing. Thanks!

This is very good. I do agree with another reviewer that I would use more liquor-- 3-4 cups. You can't really taste the alcohol at all. Is sweet but very refreshing.

We made this just yesterday for the first time.  Boy, is it the yummiest!!  We had a get together with a bunch of our neighbors, and everyone just loved it.  It is so refreshing.  I am not one to like drinks that have a strong alcohol flavor.  I tend to go for the sweeter drinks, and this one is just perfect for me.  The alcohol does not overpower the drink, and the sweetness is just right.  You've got to try this drink!!!  It is now one of my favorites.

I love gin, but you don't often see it in sweet fruity summer drinks.  I was pleasently suprised by this recipe.  I took this to a 4th of July BBQ, and it was a hit.  I used 2 family size tea bags instead of 4 tea bags.  I also added 2.5 cups of gin instead of 2.  I used Sprite for the carbonated beverage.  I am making 3 batches of this for another party this weekend.

I love this recipe, I was so glad to find it here.  I lost mine, and came here to see if anyone had it.  I have served this at lots of parties and everyone loves it. Rum works best...

I added an extra cup of vodka for a little more kick.  It still didn't have a strong liquor flavor.  Try freezing for 2 days.  It was still a little watery after freezing overnight (and my freezer is at the proper temperature), but was perfect after 2 days. Everyone loved it!!

Great and simple recipe!  Didn't have a heavy "liquor" flavor, and was just perfect on a hot, humid Chicago summer day.  Will always keep a batch of this in the freezer!

I have made this for 30 plus years.... there is one key ingredient missing.   JELLO..... when you dissolve the sugar and the water you need to dissolve the large box of Strawberry (or any flavor) JELLO.

Have made this for years.  A couple of hints.  Use Green tea.  It does make a difference.  I mix with Diet Fresca (less calories).  Be sure your "Fresca" or soda of choice is very cold.  It keeps your slush, slushy and it will not melt as fast.

This is great. Put green food color for St Pattys day. Love that you add fizz soda.  Taste so good!

Great summer drink! I cut the sugar by a 1/2 c and used club soda and it was still a little too sweet. Next time I'm going to try cutting it back 1 c and using club soda. Even though it was a little too sweet, it went down quite nicely! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! I substituted the gin for tonic (since I'm not over 21, this is a plus), and it was fantastic! This is perfect for a hot, humid, Tennessee day that needs a little splash of fun. It is great for almost anything, from a pool party to a fourth of July fireworks show. This is definitely going into my recipe binder!

This is definitely a great refreshing drink to have on hand. I've made this since 2003 for a friends 4th of July party. It's a hit every time! And it's so easy to make.
