My family was hungry for chocolate chip cookies. They requested crispy and chewy. I found this recipe on my computer and made them. What rave reviews they received!! My husband that doesn't really like sweets that well took them to work and they all ranted and raved about these crispy chewy cookies. I will definitely be making these cookies again.

they were ok...the taste was nice but the rice cereal turned hard the next day and wasn't crispy any more. Hard lumps made the texture terrible...sorry. I really liked the idea of these cookies when i read the recipe but i won't make them again.

I agree with you others who said the dough is too crumbly. I also added water to it. I think next time I will reduce the amount of add-ins...2 c. of rice krispies is probably overdoing it. The dough is so delicious by itself -- the add-ins end up overpowering the cookie. I substituted some peanut butter chips for a portion of the chocolate chips and I used Cocoa Krispies instead of regular. And I added an extra splash of vanilla extract for good measure. I found the cocoa krispies got a LITTLE bit gummy in the cooking process. Did anyone else have this result?

I changed the proportions to only 1-1/4 cups of flour and 1 cup of cereal and my dough came out fine. But I don't think the addition of the cereal did a whole lot for me. I probably wouldn't make again.

I made quite a few changes because I don't have rice krispies. I put Reece Puffs instead for the cereal and only 2 small handfulls. Then i had some extra pecan peices to use up so i threw those in too. A little extra vanilla (about 1/2 tsp) added a bit of extra flavor. I kept one batch in for the suggested 12 mintues and left a seperate batch in for about 14 minutes to see which was better. I liked the 14 minute batch they are crispier (but that may not be what you like) All in all a good recipe!

Save the crispy rice cereal for Saturday morning cartoons. If you use them for these cookies you will be haunted by the ghost of Mr Kellogg for the rest of your days. The dough is way too crumbly.

This is a great recipe..my family loves them. I added about 1 tablespoon of water however since the mixture was a little crumbly and used miniature chocolate chips. These disappeared quickly at my house!

A little dry and crumbly. Its still pretty good especially with a glass of milk. But I dont think it needs the cereal or at least not as much as this recipe calls for.

Although this cookie had a great flavor it was hard to keep dough together to bake too crumbly.

These cookies were good. I had no problem with the dough. I did cut the amount of chocolate chips in half though. The amount called for was just too overpowering for us. The rice crispies did not turn out quite as crunchy as I thought they would.

Do NOT eat these while they are warm! Usually I love CC cookies right out of the oven but not these! They were terrible but once they cool off they crisp up and are pretty good. I would probably look for a better CC cookie recipe unless I really needed something crispy. They might be better with pecans or walnuts in them...

I doubled this recipe and used brown sugar cause i had no white sugar. Hmmm These cookies were interesting. They were hard to bake as other reviewers said very crumbly. I think maybe one cup of krispies is good enough. I am going to try it with only half what it calls for of the rice cereal next time and see if that makes a difference. If anyone has any other ideas to make it less crumbly please let us know lol I tried the water as well. These are good cookies but could be wayyyy better... PS ok i just added some more margarine and sugar and that made it less crumbly!!

This recipe was great! Exactly as described a chocolate chip cookie with a little added crunch. I did not have any trouble with the dough not sticking together and the only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white.

Mmmm... these were a fun change. Sometimes I feel like I get stuck in a cookie rut. I had cocoa crispies to use up so I put them instead of the plain rice crispies! YUM! They were all gone the next day we loved them! Thanks!

Not my favorite but still really good!! Hard to get the rice krispies to mix well into it but once you get it mixed its good!
