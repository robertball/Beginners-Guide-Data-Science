Yum!  This was excellent.  I loved all the flavors in it.  I messed up, bc I mixed all the ingredients together.  That means that the spices were more of a liquid, so they didn't stick as well.  I will be doing this recipe again soon.

UPDATE:  I did this again, and found that despite all the spices, it wasn't amazing.  When I did it correctly, I found that the spices caked on the potatoes.  I think that a reduction in the "spicy" spices, would allow the other ones to stand out.  Also, there is no salt in the recipe.

Nice lightly spicy recipe, but I agreed with reviewers that it needed salt (I added about 1/2 tsp. to the spices) and I probably will add some garlic powder ,too, next time.  I just lined my jelly roll pan with foil and sprayed that, for easy clean up. Will definitely make again. Thanks, for sharing.

This is the recipe that made me finally break down and register... (every time I go searching for a recipe online I find the perfect one here.)  This dish was wonderful but wished I'd added salt while tossing. I will next time. I cut them more like home fries and used a deep baking pan for about 6 servings and did the tossing right in the pan (a lot how I do a different roasted root veggies dish.) Came out great and was a big hit at our house! Yum!

Needs egg so the spices will stick better.  I was already committed to getting the spices on there, so I had to use extra olive oil to make it work.  Excellent flavor, and they went over very well at dinner.

was a nice taste but nothing incredible. 
i didnt use an egg, instead i just coated the wedges in a little oil then sprinkled the mixed spices on top and it stuck well and made it easier.

There was nothing exceptional or delicious about the spices on these potatoes.  They definitely needed salt, the flavor was flat.  And just on the random chance that someone with clear braces and/or "braces chains" reads this:  the turmeric will badly and permanently STAIN them.  (Ditto curry, fellow braces wearers).

Looked interesting, but I just didn't think there was enough flavor.  I cut my potatoes into small cubes and made them to accompany mexican omletes for a brunch.  I found the seasoning to be bland and not spicy at all.

This is delicious made with sweet potatoes, too.  The contrast of sweet to spicy is delish!

There is a LOT going on with these but we liked them. Mine started really browning up before they got extremely crisp but I think that was my fault because I scaled it way down since there is just the two of us and I must have used too much oil. Regardless of what happened there, I refuse to give this less than 5 stars because the flavor was excellent! Thanks for the great recipe!

I have a question about the egg whites used in this recipe. Are they beaten until just mixed or thoroughly until they have incorporated air?  Please clarify, as these sound really good and I am looking forward to making this recipe. Thanks, Rebecca

These potato wedges were really really good.  I followed the recipe exactly but I left my wedges in the oven a little longer so they could get more crispy.  They were served as a side dish with the "Pot Roast Dips" and "Mojito Fruit Salad," both recipes found on this site.

I omitted the turmeric, only because we're not huge on the flavor. It turns out I didn't need the egg whites, just using the olive oil was more than enough to stick the spices on the potato wedges. These were a huge hit with the family. The whole batch was gone in about fifteen minutes. I served them with Casa Dressing, which was a good pairing. Very good!

I was excited to try these with all of those great spices, but I was a little disappointed. I thought there was way too much cumin, in fact that is all I could taste in the finished product. If I try this recipe again, I would either cut way back on the cumin or omit it all together.

We LOVED these! I was afraid that the spices would be overpowering, but they were not at all, in fact, it was actually perfect. I didn't have hot paprika, so I just used regular. I also added 1/4 tsp. onion powder, 1/4 tsp. granulated garlic powder and about 3/4 tsp. salt. These were REALLY great and I'm already planning on when to make them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used russet potatoes because thats what I had - should of used red or yukon golds- would of been better suited for this.  Turned out ok - didn't realize I didn't have tumeric.  Had a nice touch of heat and we enjoyed them but probably won't make again.  We have other roast potato recipes we prefer.  Thanks for the recipe.

The eggs should be lightly beaten.. feel free to experiment as you wish.
If you are a vegan replace egg whites with flaxseeds.

To replace one egg:
1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds
3 tablespoons water (or other liquid)

Stir together until thick and gelatinous.

You can also use whole flaxseeds:

1 tablespoon whole flaxseeds
4 tablespoons water (or other liquid)

Process seeds in a blender to a fine meal, add liquid and blend well.

These were really good!  The egg technique is what caught my eye, and it worked great for keeping the spices on the potatoes and crisping up nicely.  The spices were good, not too hot, i increased the chili powder and added cayenne.  Great technique to play around with, add whatever spices you like.

I too wondered if the egg whites were stiffly beaten, or left clear/liquidy.
This sounds very tasty and I would like to make it.
