These cookies are fabulous!  Sinful is right!  I had misgivings due to the reviews saying they were too cakey, or not sweet enough, or too dry.  I almost passed them by and I am SO glad I didn't!  They're the best cookies I've ever eaten.  The texture is perfect - just cakey enough to add body and richness but still 100% gooey moist cookie, not cake or brownie.  Not dry at all! I added 1/4 cup brown sugar to my first batch and it was too sweet - the recipe is perfect as it stands.

My only change is to add 1/2 semi-sweet chips and 1/2 white chips for flavor and contrast.  These will be a Christmas tradition in our home!

These are the best cookies I have ever made! I noticed that if I left them cook for 8 minutes they were more cakelike, but if I left them bake for a minute or 2 longer they were more cookie-like. I also removed them right away from the pan. And to avoid crumbling, I used a small flat edged metal turner and quickly scooped them up. The batter didn't look right, (kind of runny looky) however, they turned out AWESOME!

This is a funny story.  Because I read the recipe wrong, I used cream cheese rather than sour cream.  And you know what?  They were delicious!  Soft and chewy.  Try it with cream cheese, also!

I had a completly different response to this recipe  They were awful. Did not bake properly. Did not settle just like mush. I have been baking extensivly since 3rd grade. My normal cookies I bake people want me to start a cookie business. THese were really bad Sorry Marsha.

My son, the chocolate chip cookie expert rated these a definite "keeper". I don't know how you get 24 cookies from this recipe. I used huge heaping rounded tblsp. and still ended up with almost 3 dozen.

My husband really likes these cookies, especially the next day, when they are still chewy. I also enjoyed them, but they stuck to the baking sheets.

They weren't awful but just below average. I didn't care for the cake like cookie. I expected it to be better. It would be great if it was like the Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies by Debbi Borsick on this site. Now that is an awesome chocolate chip cookie.

I would have given this recipe 3 stars because although they have a great flavour they are a little too cakey for my liking but I gave them 4 stars because my kids love them!

I have used this recipe for years and love it!  It is the choc-oholic's dream! A brownie textured cookie, this dessert will charm every party goer!  For Christmas, try putting in mint chocolate chips for a more seasonal flavor!

These cookies were GREAT!! I used unsweetened cocoa & oil instead of squares. Guide is on pkg. Eliminated about 1/2 the sour cream & used 1/2 mini dark choc chips & 1/2 Andes Dark Chocolate & Mint pieces. Talk about a chocloatey-minty cookie. They were a hit at our Xmas Party!!

This is "the chocolate chip cookie" recipe for me! I have tried most of the top rated ones, but this one is the winner. I followed the recipe, with exception of the unsweetened chocolate because I didn't have any on hand. This is more cakey and soft which is the type of cookie I love. I sprayed the cookie sheet each time with cooking spray and I baked on a dark non-stick pan. For some reason, a lighter metal pan would not bake the cookie properly. My husband is extremely picky and he loved them.

Wonderful cookie that everyone I try them on loves.  They cooked fine for me since I hate crunchy cookies (which aren't fun to eat).

These were ok...maybe I did something wrong? The only thing that I may have did differently is use cocoa instead of squares of choc. I found the cookies to taste alright but a little too floury...maybe more butter would have helped.?? On the plus side they made 2 shy of three doz.

My boyfriend is so picky when it comes to the texture of his cookies, he likes them chewy and soft, not crunchy and he loved this recipe!! I skipped the double boiler part and they turned out great! If your a soft cookie fan, this is perfect!

I used cream cheese instead of sour cream because that's all I had in the house. I added a few sprinkles of cinnamon into the flour and it really gave it a nice taste! However, the cookie itself was very cake-like. I tried avoiding it by cooking them a few minutes longer so they were golden brown but they were still cakey and got very hard overnight. It might be smoother with the sour cream, I'm not sure, but I probably won't be making these again :(

Not sweet enough, in my opinion. Cakey and light, the flavor is good but I wouldn't say this is a sinful cookie. Maybe an increase in sugar and adding coffee might make this richer.

This cookie looked like it was going to be good as I mixed the dough. But was disappointed. For starters I can taste the flour (so if anyone cares to try reduce the flour to 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups) it's a little bit too gooey to my liking, and as some others have already suggested it has a cake like texture to it. I even tried baking it for 2-3 mins more than the suggested time. They are not bad cookies, they are just not perfect to my liking. So I might just leave it in the office kitchen under the help yourself sign. Sorry, but I will likely not be using this recipe again.

I would have given 3 stars, but my husband would have given 5, so we averaged it out to 4. This was a very cakelike cookie, without being dry. I made one batch to be a plain choco chip cookie, without the added chocolate in the dough. I would add more vanilla next time if I made them that way again. I made a second batch using the chocolate (Ghirardelli) and subing PB chips for chocolate. They were ok... but the dough is not very chocolatey, even though I doubled the amount of chocolate used. It is more of a light hint.

Very good but more like miniature cakes than cookies. Also, this recipe makes way more than 2 dozen cookies so keep that in mind.

Excellent cookie.  Rich and cakey, the sour cream makes them nice and soft (make sure to store them in an air-tight container).  I had a hard time not eating the dough!  These disappeared in record time at work and my husband and son were upset that I didn't leave them more!  Guess I'll be making more!  Thanks for sharing!

This was a really easy cookie recipe.  I used the microwave to melt the butter and chocolate, which reduced cooking time even more.  Yes, these are very cake-like cookies, but that'e one of the things I liked about these because they're so different.  The whole family loved them, including my 4 and 2 year old daughters.  I will definitely make them again, and have plenty of cold milk in the fridge!

VERY chocolaty recipe!  It was probably too rich because I could only eat one then retire.  But then again, it's probably good that I couldn't eat too many and get a stomach ache!  Very yummy, everyone loved them.

These are delicious! I love cakey, soft cookies, and these fit the bill.... almost like cupcake tops. :) They were a smidge less sweet than I'd like, but that would be easily fixed by using semi-sweet chocolate. I added a teaspoon of instant espresso powder, and chopped pecans. I'll definitely be making these again!

I got good reactions at work, but not spectacular ones. The cookies weren't as chocolatey as I thought they would be, but my colleagues thought they were fine. However, I must've not baked them long enough because they were a little too soft/moist. But overall these were good and I will hang on to the recipe in case I want to make them again.

I thought these cookies were heavenly!  They are cake-like, so if that is not what you are looking for don't make them.  If you are looking for a good soft cookie, these are it!!

YUMMY!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  They're just what my hubby and I were looking for.  Very chocolaty and soft with a great texture.  Not an overly-sweet cookie, just perfect.  I'll definitely make these again (he's already begging me for more!).

I did quite a bit of modifications, making it a bit healthy.  Cut down the sugar to just 1 cup, added 2 tbsp of ground flaxseed, and used Ener-g egg replacers instead.  The cookies turned out moist.  And so far, this was the quickest and easiest cleanup I've had to do (hate baking for this reason).

Well, now that I've read other reviews I don't feel so bad! As a matter of fact, I thought I had done something wrong, but all in all, they were pretty good...if you like "cake chocolate chip cookies" ...I thought they were a lot like little cakes too.  :-)

This is now my husband's absolute favorite cookie!  I doubled the chocolate squares so it was a deep, dark chocolate appearance, and reduced the baking powder by half so that the cookie was more chewy than caky.  They also travel well, as I send 2 dozen to my son serving in Iraq, sealed in tupperware.  After 3 weeks in the mail, he said they were still soft and chewy and his buddies request more asap!

These are seriously the best cookies I've ever made! All my friends request them for every party.  When I meet new people, I'm always introduced as "This is Amy, she makes these AMAZING cookies!"
I always beat the sugar and eggs together for at least 5 minutes to get it really well beat. I bake them for about 7 minutes so they're just barely done and a little gooey in the middle and once they come out I scrape them off to reduce the amount of time it takes to clean the pan.
They're incredible fresh out of the oven.
MAKE THIS RECIPE!

I gave this recipe 3 stars even though I do not plan on making it again.  It tastes good (very cakey) but it is not a good cookie-jar cookie.  What others say is true, it is like a cross between a cookie and a brownie - not necessarily a bad thing but these seemed to take on the brownie softness, retaining the stickiness and slight limpness of a brownie.  Even after completely cool, they were still not very firm and perky and stuck to each other when I tried to stack them in the cookie-jar.  Again, they are good tasting but they are not going to be pretty as we make our way down the pile in the jar since they are sure to have cookie bits stuck to the slightly sticky tops and be limply falling onto the napkin after the first bite.

I did not put any sour cream as it was hard to find in the supermarkets around my area. The cookies came out quite flat. The colour was a horrible dung-like-brown and it the top was very cracked. Although I found the chocolaty taste alright, it was too sweet even tough I had already reduced the sugar. I wouldn't try it again.

These cookies turned out really nice.  Although I only used half the amount of Hershey's unsweetened chocolate, because I didn't get what the recipe called for beforehand, they still turned out good, you could probably get away with only using half the amount of chocolate instead of the full amount.  Both my son and I liked them, but my husband said they were a bit dry, oh well you can't please everyone.

My son had to take cookies for his whole kindergarten class so I tried this recipe for a little something different than the regular chocolate chip. When I picked him up from school the kids from his class ran up to me to rave about these cookies. And they were right! These cookies stayed soft and it was me who couldn't keep my hands out of the cookie jar!

To describe these cookies as "asolutely sinful" was a sin in itself.  These cookies were more cake-like than gooey and chewy.  They were not very sweet.  If you like a semi-sweet cookie that is soft but not messy this is the cookie for you.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Wonderful and easy to make cookie. Yes the dough is very moist but holds it's shape well. I use silpat silicone baking sheets. Nine minutes was PERFECT. 

Do NOT over bake.

These cookies looked so weird when me and my friends brought them out of the the oven. They smelled delicious. They were SO easy to take off the pan. Our cookies were slightly dry but still good! They are the most delicious cookies we ever made! Whoever said that these cookies are bad, CAN'T COOK! These cookies rocked! They are perfect with just a glass of milk!

If I wanted cake I would make cake. We wanted chewy decadent cookies, what we got was a cake with crust on the bottom.

These cookies were awesome,so soft and chewy. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup sugar in the raw, also I used nestle quik chocolate milk mix instead of unsweetened chocolate. I made these super quick late at night for some friends, needless to say everyone loves me even more.

These are remarkably good.  The sour cream adds just enough milky softness and a little hint of bite to cut the sweet.

5 stars- quick & easy, good & chocolatey.  They are kind of cake-like, but I don't consider that a bad quality.  I had no problem getting them off my cookie sheets after about 1 minute.  I will keep this one.

These were FANTASTIC!!! Don't be afraid of the gooey dough - they will be fine! Be prepared for a very soft cookie packed full of chocolate goodness! I was surprised how soft they were inside - much like cake make sure you let them cool before removing from cookie sheet!! 
A KEEPER!!!

A great cookie, very soft and a good way to use up sour cream!  I added 4 broken Skor chocolate bars instead of the chips.  It was good but I will try chocolate chips next time.

These cookies were excellent. If you are looking for more ofa cake-like cookie, than this is the recipe for you. Also, I didn't have the chocolate bar to add,but it still came out perfect. A winner for sure!

I made them for my classmates and they all said they were absolutely delicious. I added about a teaspoon of coffee to the butter/bittersweet chocolate mixture and thought that it rounded out the chocolate flavor really well.

We loved these cookies.  I would definitely recommend greasing the cookie sheets with cooking spray first...they tend to stick a little.  Instead of the unsweetened chocolate I used 1/4 c. (1-oz.) of a 12-oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I used the remaining chips in the batter.  This is how I put it together: I melted the butter with 1/4 c. chocolate chips in the microwave for 1 minute; using fork mix it till chocolate chips melt completely and mixture is smooth. With a mixer, beat sugar, eggs and vanilla then add butter mixture; mix well.  Add flour, soda, powder and salt; mix till blended then add sour cream and mix.  Add remaining chocolate chips and mix.  I baked for 10 minutes. At my house half of the cookies are gone before they even have time to cool completely.  Still warm they had a slightly crispy outside, once cooled completely they were soft in and out.  Thanks for the recipe it is a keeper!

This recipe was great.  My grandmother made all the same cookies for Christmas for as long as I could remember and everyone loved them.  One Christmas I made these for her and she loved them so much she asked for the recipe.    They aren't like normal chocolate chip cookies they are softer but delicious.

the dough that this recipe generates is more than slightly wet, i thought i had totally messed it up, but its actually supposed to be that way. the shorter amount of time you cook them for the more cake-like they are. the longer you cook them the more cookie like they are. I made these for a friend and he absolutely loved them ! they also stayed superfresh for a whole week.

The batter looks more like a brownie batter and is too runny to make a "round" tablespoon, even with a cookie scoop. Even when cooled this "cookie" is way to soft for my liking. Will not bake these again!

I followed the recipe exactly, but my cookies were much darker (more chocolately) than the cookies in the picture. And because of the unsweetened chocolate, they weren't very sweet. It all depends on what you like, though!

I made these cookies with my six-year-old daughter on a snowy day! It was a fun and indulgent treat to make, but the cookies came out very 'cakey'. The sweet, rich taste was wonderful, but I prefer a cookie that's a little chewy and crunchy.

We were disappointed with this recipe. It does have a lot of potential though. I especially liked how the sour cream blended to create subtle complexities in the taste. The results did turn out cake-like as most of the reviewers said -- could this be due to the amount of baking powder and soda used? The cookies were so soft  and ended up sticking to each other in the end. Also, the recipe calls for a lot of chocolate chips (i used only a cup and the cookies still turned out too sweet). We prefer a deeper chocolatey taste. So far, the Mrs. Field's recipe remains my favorite. Might try to revise this recipe in the future to see what works best.

Oh my goodness. These were addictive. I used mini semisweet chocolate chips instead of the bittersweet chocolate. I cut the baking soda and replaced the sour cream with fat free sour cream. And I used margarine instead of butter. The outcome was a delicious fluffy, yet rich, cookie.

I made these cookies for my boyfriend and we both agree - they weren't very good. Very cakey, and the sour cream made for a very strange taste. I'd look for something a little less experimental if you want a good chocolate cookie recipe.

i loved this recipe! i read the reviews and was worried it might be too chocolatey so i only used 2 blocks of unsweetened chocolate instead of 2 and a half. it was definitely a brownie/cake-like cookie as the others described which is totally what i wanted... if you like your cookies that way you should try this :)

I have always preferred a cake like chocolate cookie but gave up finding a recipe until I came across this recipe.  It's absolutely PERFECT.  Big and fluffly and not too sweet.  Because I wasn't in the mood for a lot of chocolate I omitted the melted unsweetened chocolate.  I doubled the recipe due to the size of my family.  I replaced have of the butter with Crisco.  This helps to keep the cookies moist and soft and retain their shape.  I also replaced half the white sugar with brown sugar.  Again, the moisture in brown sugar helps to keep the cookies soft.  I beat the butter and Crisco until light and fluffy then slowly added the sugars then added the eggs and vanilla.  Last step was to add the flour alternating with the sour cream.  Next time I'll try it with the unsweetened chocolate.  Awesome recipe.  It's my new go to recipe for chocolate chip cookies  Thanks so much Emma for sharing your recipe.

I tried a version of this recipe - didn't put in the extra chocolate and made them with chocolate and peanut butter chips.  Seriously, the best cookie I've ever made.  Light, soft and fluffy, like cake cookies.  Sweet but not sugary cookies.  Delicious!!

These cookies were great! I left out the baking soda, but it was only a small detail.

The recipe was enough for me to make 36. However, since the cookies were a very light color, I kept thinking they weren't ready yet and ended up burning the first 9 cookies.

The rest were really good though. Even my parents thought they were great.

These are delicious!  I leave out the chocolate chips b/c for me, they are too chocolatey but most people love them.  They are cakey (versus chewy) though, so just be forewarned

These are great cookies, my children call them the brownie cookies. I found to make them a bit sweeter I used half semi-sweet chocolate with the unsweetened chocolate squares and it works better to mix them by hand, using a mixer adds too much air and they become more cake like,but other than that I would definitely recommend this recipe.

Cookies came out very well. I did not change anything as far as ingredients and they came out fine. I sprayed some Pam on the cookie sheet. I also noticed most of the time I like my cookies on the "short" side as in "gooier" but 8 mins was not enough I ended up cooking them for more like 11. Taste amazing, but I think the instructions should be tweaked; thank you.

For a chocolate chip cooking I felt the taste was not diverse enough. More like a brownie with chocolate chips in it.

These cookies are very moist and tasty! but the reason i only gave it 3 stars is because they were a little too cake like for me and i would recomend using semi-sweet chocolate istead of unsweetened. o and they also didnt look very good.

We loved these Marsha! I made regular chocolate chip cookies in addition to these and what I loved was that the texture seemed to be a cross between a cookie and a brownie. I really liked the "cakey" texture as it was different from your traditional cookie. I guess the sour cream must have something to do with it. Thanks!

There cookies are soft, but that is their only good quality. They don't settle as they cook, they are not sweet, they are bland and they are too cakey. I thought from all of the 5 stars and good reviews these would be great, but the family won't eat them and I am a little embarrassed to take them to work. Obviously people do like them, but I don't see why. I rarely write reviews but for all the trouble of getting sour cream and unsweetened choc. I thought I should let people know this recipe isn't as good as it seems. sorry

This recipe makes a good, soft, double-chocolate cookie, which I will probably make again.  However, the title "absolutely sinful" is a little lofty for these cookies.  They're just "good".

My three teens an my husband liked the great chocolate flavor but not the soft texture.  They really are delicious but are more like a brownie than a cookie.

These cookies were fantastic!  I've shared the recipe with co-workers and friends and everyone loves them.  Since I didn't have any squares of chocolate, I substituted with about 5 tablespoons of cocoa. They were soft and delicious!

I have been looking for a really good Chocolate-chocolate chip cookie recipe that is SOFT.  I hate hard cookies but these were perfect both warm out of the oven and later when cooled!

Very good batch of cookies, light and soft, and very quick to make.  Try semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips for variety, or even peanut butter chips.  Well done!

Delightfull little puffs of chocolatey goodness!I did not have unsweetened baking chocolate on hand so I used 2/3 cup of cocoa powder instead. I screwed up and used 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 1/4 cup it called for and still yummy.  This will definately be my "go to" chocolate chip cookie recipie.

Really good and brilliant.  Everyone keeps asking what I put in it.  Just make sure that you put in the right amounts of dry ingredients, otherwise it may be too runny.  I used regular milk chocolate rather unsweetened, which was better, and actually used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup with 3 TB of white sugar instead.

I altered it a bit but I thought they turned out pretty good. I decided to use more cream cheese than sour cream because I absoluetly loathe sour cream...but I definately love the taste. I would reccomend doing this for anyone with a plain, boring cookie dough. Like maybe someone with sugar cookies who ran out of vanilla.

These cookies were awesome!!!! The first time I made them they were completely gone after the 1st day! Really thick and chocolatey and you will definetly need a glass of milk beside you. You should not eat more than 2 cookies at a time because if you do you will get a stomach ache. (I've been there before!)

This cookie was really soft and stuck together with other cookies.  I'm not sure if I just didn't bake them enough or what, but I think they could've been better.  Even if they did taste like a good mouthful of chocolate.

This is a WONDERFUL chocolate/chocolate chip recipe for more cake-like cookies!  They are the best I have ever had! (Don't tell Mom!)I used semi-sweet chips in place of the unsweetened chocolate.  It makes a super rich cookie!

Maybe a little less sugar (190/200 gr), because sugar burns other ingredients flavour...

My boyfriend was begging me to make the cookies all night. I finally did and after all the trouble he doesn't like them!! And neither do I. They are not "cookie" like, yet very cakey and too much choc.  I followed the recipe exactly, so I don't know what could have went wrong? Maybe I should have reduced the amount of choc. chips and not have put in the bars of unsweetened choc. However, it seems as though alot of people do like them, so maybe mine just didn't turn out well. I do notice that alot of recipes call for 2 eggs, but an oatmeal cookie recipe called for 3 and that made all the difference in the texture. This recipe might call for 3 instead of 2 then.

This is a GREAT recipe:). They did end up having a brownie like texture, but that just makes them all the more indulgent. They came out perfectly the first time, although I left them to cool for a bit longer than instructed. I also baked them on aluminum foil - made them much easier to remove:)! Chill the cookie dough for fifteen to thirty minutes for best results.

Absolutely excellent! Definitely a cookie for chocolate lovers and those that like cake-like cookies. Almost a brownie. Next time (and there will be a next!) I will add some chopped walnuts.

Easy to make, but the pan does require some greasing . . . nice tasting.  Texture is cakey . . . nothing super special though.

I was looking for a cakey type cookie so I really like this recipe. They're easy to make and come out nice, I used a Silpat too so had no problems with them sticking to the cookie sheet. Great recipe, my husband loves them so I will be making them again. Although I am still on the hunt for a more fudgey/cakey cookie recipe.

My family LOVED these cookies.  The sour cream makes them moist.  Be careful not to overbake as they can easily become dry.  I may try substituting 1 Cup of peanut butter chips for 1 Cup of the choc. chips next time for something different.  Thanks for this recipe!

These cookies were a HUGE hit with my family!  The are a great change from the ordinary chocolate chip recipes.  Next time, I will try them with either mint chips or peanut butter chips!  Also, I used parchment paper on my cookie sheets...the never stuck!  Thanks for sharing the recipe Marsha!

This recipe was a great success when my 12 year old  daughter made it, very very tasty and very chocolatey. The only problem was taking the cookies off the paper, they stuck to the paper!

I thought they turned out ok, but my family and friends seem to really like them.  The recipe made a lot more than it said it would.  It made 36 large cookies, rather than 24.  I made a couple of the cookies using only about 3/4 a tablespoon of dough each, and they were better than the big ones.  They could have been made even smaller.  They were not as chocolatey as they sound.

Yum!!!!! My husband requested a chocolate cookies with chocolate chips and this was the first one I tried and it's great! The only trouble I had was that even though I let them cool for at least 5 minutes on the cookie sheet, some of them broke as I tried to take them off. Normally I wouldn't care, but I wanted some of them to look nice because we were going to take them to visitors to our church. I discovered after the 2nd sheet that rather than slowly and gently trying to get my spatula under them and ease them off the sheet, one quick and firm push of the spatula usually got them off the sheet without breaking. It's really ok that some of them broke, though, because those are the ones we got to eat!!!!

VERY chocolatey!  I only had about 1/2 cup of sour cream, so I added a bit of milk as well.  They really turned out well.  I undercooked the first batch a bit :( but the last batch was fully cooked and the middle of the cookie still stayed soft!  IMO they're a bit too rich to make all the time, but I will most likely make them again.  :)  My husband LOVED them, but my 2-year-old was done after about 1/2 a cookie.  It was probably too rich!

These were very cakey...not very cookie like at all. The flavor was good, not great. I used a mix of chocolate chunks and mini chips. The kids said they liked them, but two days later there are quite a few left...

I thankfully read the part in the recipe that said to wait 5 minutes on cookie sheet after baking and before setting on wire rack, not one broke, then I shared the cookies with husband, kids and co-workers; all said the same thing; "Best chocolate chip cookies they ever tasted": thank you so much for sharing your recipe I will use it again!

I was looking for a chocolate chip cookie recipe that would result in a soft, cake-like texture.  This certainly filled the bill.  The consistency was exactly what I was looking for.  I did omit the unsweetened chocolate.  I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I think it could have used even a bit more brown sugar but overall the taste was good and husband loved!!

Just came out of the oven! They are like mini Brownie cookies. Not the typical crispy cookie but you won't here this brownie lover complain. I used M&Ms instead of chips Oh My YUM! They did stick a little to the pan but i fixed that with a little Pam! Making these again soon! Oh, and the batter...finger lickin good!

This was a little cakey for my liking and I thought the chocolate taste was a little flat.  Perhaps using semi-sweet baking chocolate would help.

I misread the recipe and only added half the amount of unsweetened chocolate.  Cookies still turned out really good.  Soft and chewy.  Angela

The cookies were pretty good.  My students enjoyed them but I thought they were a bit floury.

Try using the Hershey Cinnamon chips in this recipe.  My high school age son makes them for every possible event at school and there are never enough.

These taste like a chocolate brownie with chocolate chips in them.  They are good but not a favorite.  I think they would be good with a butterscotch chip frosting.
