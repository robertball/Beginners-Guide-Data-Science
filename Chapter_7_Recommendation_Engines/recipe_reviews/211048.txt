I love homemade alfredo sauce, but don't always have the time. I don't think jarred alfredo sauce tastes like homemade but I don't mind the taste of jarred and my kids prefer it. This was a super easy recipe to make after a long day at work.

Im just now learning to cook (and relizing I love it). I love this meal, my mom made this for me all the time. However,I was not pleased with this recipe! The sauce was not very good! I will make my own next time!I breaded my chicken that was the best part!
