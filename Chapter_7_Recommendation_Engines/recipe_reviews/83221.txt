This recipe turned out okay for me at first. After making it I thought the lemon over powered the mint and cilantro so I strained it in cheesecloth and let about 3 tablespoons of liquid out, replaced it with a little water and added a little sugar to taste, blended it in the chopper again. After doing this, I looked up other mint chutney recipes and they called for sugar. Maybe the tamarind juice would have been better, but I didn't have any.  The end result was good, so I would suggest adding the lemon juice to taste.

Very tasty, but I used rice vinegar instead of water, which added another dimension of flavor.

I was very excited to find this recipe and I followed it exactly. It tasted like pureed onion. Because the reviews are so good, I will definitely make this again. I'm wondering if there's a certain type of onion that needs to be used with this recipe.

Excellent, simple recipe, with loads of good fresh chlorophyll and flavor.  This recipe makes too much for us, though, so I halve the ingredients in this recipe and it's just right for two of us to have with a meal.  (It doesn't store particularly well, so best to make it fresh and eat it all up.)  :)  We love it spicy, but when we eat it with another very spicy dish we leave out the chiles to offer some balance to the meal.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I added about a teaspoon of honey, and a pinch of kosher salt, and that really brightened up all the flavors.  Thanks for the recipe peep!

i love mint chutney, and this was delicious! i used it to eat with noni afghani (from this site), which is a little bland in itself. the mint chutney perked it right up, and it was one of the best i've had! i didn't need any water for some reason, the consistency was right all on it's own. the chile i had was kind of big, so it was a bit spicy - otherwise, perfect!

Very good! I'd like mine spicier so next time I'll add more chilies.  Mine turned out a bit too salty for my taste so next time I'll add salt to taste after running everything else through the food processor.

This is absolutely delicious.  Tamarind isn't something you can get anywhere near where I live so I used a tbsp of (store-bought) tamarind chutney.  This got raves at the party I took it to.  I served it with samosas made with phyllo.  YUM YUM

Try using just 3/4 cup mint and one jalapeno (with the seeds if you like more heat). -- Then, mix in a about 1/2 cup plain, full fat yogurt.  Delicious on all kinds of stuff!.

I've spent quite a bit of time in India and a dear friend taught me how to make hers. -- Once you try it, you find things to dip it in!

I thought this recipe did not come out very good.  I took advice of the previous recipe and cut the onion in half and it still tasted like a bunch of ground up herbs.  The onion is too overpowering, I think there are better mint chutney recipes out there.

STRONG!!!!  Actually, I probably just put way too much mint in it, and I may or may not have used a jalapeno instead of a chile, so that would be the explanation.  My advice, then, is to substitute extra mint for the cilantro and a jalapeno for the chile if you want something that will blow your tastebuds to mintland (which is actually kind of nice this time of year), and not to do that if you aren't interested in the mint-coma.  WOW.

This is a great recipe. I don't have a food processer, just finely chopped up everything - it was a little chunky but I'm fine with chunky. We eat it with our naan bread and Indian dishes (coconut tomato curry type dishes are the best with this chutney) but also good with crackers and cream cheese, pita bread and hummus or tortilla chips.

Very refreshing. Goes great with samosas. I will be making this again and again, and even started growing a mint plant just for this.

I just made this and I have to say, it's one of the best mint chutneys I have ever eaten. I subbed out lime for the tamarind and added two cloves of garlic because I'm like that, but I digress, this will be my goto mint chutney recipe from now on!

I have tried many Mint Chutney recipes, trying to find the one closest to my favorite Indian place that is now 1500 miles away!  This one is great.  I the only change I made was to use less onion.  I found the onion flavor to be a bit overwhelming using an entire onion. Not a fan of raw onion flavor.  Half the onion was just right.

To the above recipe add half a tea spoon of sugar and a small piece of ginger. You could also add half a coconut grated and grind them all together....yummy...

I used yogurt instead of water and excluded onion and lemon/tamarind juice. I find it good with fritters and fried spring rolls.

I made this with lemon juice and pickled jalapeno because I didn't have any fresh green chili. The result was perfect and exactly as I had hoped. I often buy Aki's brand mint chutney but my store was out this week and my garden happens to be overrun with mint and cilantro so I thought I would give this recipe a try. This turned out even better than the store bought. Fresh flavour with lots of spice. My husband and I ate lots and even my young children had a few drops on their food. I will be making this all summer.

This was delicious! I looked at several recipes and I added some things,  I know its annoying to read people's modifications but I think it made it better.  I added 1/2 t of powdered ginger & 1/2 t of cumin.  I only used half an onion.  It was  watery so next time I will add the water by tablespoon as needed.  We ate it with naan and the kids used rice crackers.  Sooooo good, nutritious and its such a pretty green!!

I'm not sure I like this but will experiment with different foods and update if I like it.  I cut recipe in half and used lime juice with a little stevia to sub for tamarind juice.  I love all the ingredients that go into this and was disappointed when I ate it over plain chicken.  Maybe that's not what it is for but might taste better with a Thai dish or Middle Eastern fare.  Thanks, Peep.

This came out very bitter.  And the onion was over-powering.  It was completely inedible.

I LOVE mint chutney and always ask for extra whenever I go out for Indian food. I just had to try making at at home. This recipe is a great starter and that you can customize. I used lime juice instead of lemon - I think lime goes better with cilantro than lemon. I also added 6 oz of nonfat yogurt to help the flavors meld, and about 2 tbsp of vegetable broth (water seemed a little plain to me). I added 1 tbsp of Sriracha instead of the green pepper, and three cloves of garlic. Flavorful, delicious and the perfect match for crock pot chana masala!
