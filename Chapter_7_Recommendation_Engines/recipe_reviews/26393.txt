I made a lower-fat version with "light" vanilla soy milk, non-fat sour cream and fat free half and half.  I also doubled the berries.  It was really wonderful and supercreamy.  I didn't miss the fat at all!

I was looking for a recipe to replicate the one I had on a Carnival cruise several years ago and THIS IS IT!  I've made this recipe many, many times and I love it!  I usually add a little more sugar than the recipe calls for.  If I'm making it for a special occasion, I'll use whole milk and regular sour cream.  If I'm making it just for me, I'll use skim milk and low-fat sour cream.  It still tastes just as good!

Absolutely wow!!!!! I cannot believe people did not like this. I have been back into the soup turine five times since making this one and a half hours ago. My kids have each had two servings and this was because they couldn't wait until dinner. I decided to add ground cinnamon because it took the flavors to another level (I have a great strawberry bread recipe that has a lot of cinnamon in it and I was basing my decision to add on that recipe). Anyhow, the cinnamon adds a nice bit of color as well and doesn't make it as pink. Try this recipe and fall in love with it. It makes such an ample amount. I did go ahead an increase the sugar as well but did it to taste.

I have always wanted to try a cold fruit soup, buit never had the occasion.  I made this today for a women's luncheon and everyone polished off their bowls and gave great compliments.  I did not add sugar, as the frozen strawberries I bought had added sugar.  It was perfect.  I'm going to try this again only with peaches!

This was very good. I used half & half instead of the heavy cream, & used light sour cream. The strawberries I bought were unsweetened & I had to add half a cup of sugar instead of only 2 T. For the people who said there wasn't enough sugar, they most likely got unsweeted strawberries like I did. The store didn't have sweetened. No one else mentioned this but all of it didn't fit in the blender. I put it all in & after the strawberries crused, it overflowed. I had to blend the rest in 2 batches. I cut up some fresh strawberries to put in the soup & topped it with a little whipped cream. The flavors really develop if you let it chill overnight. It was a nice dessert on a hot summer night.

This was a hit at a tea luncheon I had this past Saturday.  I made it low fat and no one knew it.  I doubled the berries, used fat free half and half instead of the milk and heavy cream and used low fat sourcream.  I did use the sugar and I chopped some strawberries for the soup. I also garnished with strawberry slices on top.

I had some chilled Strawberry Soup at a tea last year, and was so surprised how good it was. I was delighted to find this recipe on Allrecipes. I altered the recipe a little. I did use the cup of half and half but used 1 cup of sour cream instead of the 1/2 cup it called for, I did not add the milk, but instead added 1/2 cup of white wine, and I increased the sugar to just a bit over 1/3 of a cup. I'm attending a tea in September and cannot wait to bring this to the event. Thanks for the recipe!

I increased this recipe for 18 to serve a Kiwanis luncheon.  They all loved it.  I think next time I will add a little more milk at the last minute because I made it the day before and it was a little thick, but great! I'm going to try it with peaches.

I doubled the recipe and and used fresh strawberries insterad of frozen.  I had to add extra Splenda probably because the fresh berries don't have added sweetners like frozen.  Too chill quickly, I put in the freezer, and served to family.  All 7 adults loved it paired with mexican entree.

I don't know if I'd call it soup. It was nice, but I had the urge to stick a straw in it and drink it as a milkshake. I had some left over and poured it into popsicle tubes as a summertime treat.

I like the idea of this soup, but the sour cream taste was way too dominant.  It's all I could taste.  If I try another cold fruit soup, I'll omit the sour cream altogether.  I would probably double up on the fruit as well, since this didn't taste as fruity as I hoped it would.

Very YUMMY!  I did use a lot of extra sugar b/c the strawberries I used were not sweetened.  FYI, it took about 4 cups of whole strawberries to make the 2 cups of pureed strawberries the recipe calls for.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  This is one of my new favorites!

This is wonderful. I noticed a few comments about a weak strawberry flavor and thought I'd note that it needs to be 2 liquid cups of strawberries, maybe that's why it seemed short on them. I followed the recipe exactly, added a little extra sugar to taste and it is superb. Thank you so much.

Made this for a retreat, where the heat index was upwards of 100-degrees.  People loved it -- cold, contained real fruit, and tasty without being sugary or syrupy.  Chilled it to just-this-side-of-frozen--mmmm.  Going to make more for myself this week as soon as I can get the ingredients.  :-)

I thought this was just okay, not nearly as good as a strawberry soup recipe I used to make (but have since lost! Gah!). I added a bit of vanilla but I think the strawberry to milk ratio is a bit off; more fruit, less liquid for me next time.

I searched for this recipe 6 years ago after going on a Carnival cruise for my 25th anniversary. I've been making it every year since for my nephew's birthday. Living in Maine, June is fresh strawberry season and his birthday is in June. It's always a huge hit. First time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. After that I've modify it sometimes to be low fat - nobody ever knows the difference.

I loved this soup. I didn't have to heat the stove and that was a plus. I used fresh strawberries, skim milk, half and half and lemon yogurt - because that's what I had on hand. It was delicous. I put a dallup of yogurt on top for a garnish and swirled it with a spoon. It looked pretty enough to serve to guests. I'll make this recipe again, that's for sure.

I thought this was close to Carnival's recipe, but I did tweak it to suit my taste.  I used 4c thawed unsweetend strawberries, 2c milk, 1 1/2c heavy cream, 3/4c sour cream and 1/2c sugar. My family is going to love this. Thanks for sharing it!

Wow, very good! Everyone liked it, after they got over the idea of cold fruit soup! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because next time I will add more strawberries!

I used frozen raspberries instead (which meant slightly more sugar).  The soup has a good flavor, but I couldn't help but feel like I was eating melted ice cream!  My personal preference would be for something a wee bit less rich. Nevertheless, I bet most will just adore this easy-to-make treat.

Very yummy but the consistency was like water even after it set overnight.  I followed others suggestions to add more sugar and it came out perfect.  The only thing is that my husband tossed the spoon and drank his bowl like a caveman.  Thanks

Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.  My 11-yr.-old son ate 5 bowls one night on Carnival cruise.  I'm so happy to have a recipe and look forward to trying it with peaches and other fruits.

I was looking for this recipe and was excited it was like the one I had on a Cruise.  This was really easy to make and I made it for a party and people loved it.  However, I made one change to the recipe.  I used heavy whipping cream and didn' use any milk at all.  When I was making it & before I added the milk, it was creamy & milky enough and I didn't want to dilute the very wonderful strawberry flavor.

I made extra just in case and it was all gone quickly.  I served it on a hot day as a first course to bbq and everyone loved it.  It was the perfect amount of sweetness for a soup.  Use a blender that is sure to blend everything so that the soup is smooth.

I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS.  EVEN AFTER ADDING SEVERAL TABLESPOONS OF SUGAR, IT STILL WAS NOT SWEET ENOUGH.  OUT OF DESPERATION, SINCE I WAS SERVING IT TO COMPANY, I FOLDING A LITTLE COOL WHIP INTO IT.  IT ENDED UP TASTING LIKE A BOWL OF MELTED ICE CREAM.  ALSO, I DON'T THINK IT HAD NEARLY ENOUGH OF A STRAWBERRY TASTE.

Served as a first course, everyone finished it all! I used fat free sour cream and reg whip cream and frozen (unsweetened) strawberries. It still sounds fattening but it was a hit. I'm going to try fat free cream next time.

Great recipe! I tried the lower-fat version (the one with yogurt) which we really liked, and this one is delicious too. I think we'll serve this milk/cream/sour cream version when we have guests and the lower-fat version for regular use. This would be a perfect summer soup with bread and a crispy salad.

The flavor was a little different than I was expecting but I liked it, not too sweet.  I’m looking for something that is a little unique and refreshing for spring/summer entertaining.   I served the soup in depression glass punch cups which was perfect.

This is OK. It's more like a watered-down smoothie, rather than a fruit soup. I've never taken a Carnival Cruise, so, perhaps ,for the folks who have, this evokes happy food memories.

I used 2 packets of Splenda to sweeten this instead of sugar. Also used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. Overall, taste was good. However, I feel like I'd need to work with this recipe again to see if I could get the fat down-- 20g per serving seems really high to me! Assuming most of that is coming from the heavy cream, I'd try to cut the portion of that next time.

I added ground nutmeg & cinnamon and more sugar than what the recipe called for and the flavor was fantastic. I believe it was even better than the strawberry bisque that I had (and loved) on a cruise. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious and refreshing, even though I had to low-carb it by using Splenda and Carb Countdown instead of sugar and milk, respectively.  Will definitely make again.  Yum!

I love this recipie! After the first time I made it, I tried it with a medley of fruits, including blackberries and blueberries. I also subsituted half and half for heavy cream and added more fruit than called for. To make the soup a little bit more creamy and light, I added light whipped cream in the last seconds of blending. It turned out wonderful!

This soup was OK.  I thought it needed more flavor, more strawberries and sugar would help.  I made it using light cream and low fat sour cream, my guests seemed to enjoy it, and all of their cups came back empty, so I am giving it a 4 instead of a 3.

I've had the Carnival Cruise version and this one didn't quite make it.  It was too creamy for me.  I could probably try again with more strawberries and sugar, but don't really want to.  Most of my family ate it, but wasn't overly impressed.

This recipe is fantastic and is a delightful treat for the whole family. The only problem is that this recipe does not add enough sugar. I know this sounds abd is ridiculously fattening but you need to add AT LEAST a cup and a half of sugar to be sweet enough. Adding whipped cream doesn't work and only weakens the strawberry taste. Only use it as a topping if you must. Otherwise, this is a great recipe and delicous treat.

I've never tried fruit soup before but needed to use up some strawberries before they went bad and I thought this recipe was pretty good. My fiance thought it was weird-tasting but me and the kids liked it (they thought it tasted like Go-Gurt).

I liked this recipe!  It was very easy to make, and not very expensive either.  
I think it presents more as a drink, than a soup - especially served in the cups.  I  think next time, I will serve it in bowls and perhaps add some mint leaves for garnish.
Should definitely be served with a heavier meal, as it is such a light dessert.

I thought it tasted best right after it was made.  It lost some of it's strawberry flavor by the next day.  SO liked it was but it did taste like gogurt/smoothies/melted ice cream.  As other reviewers suggested I used 3 c unsweetened strawberries and upped the sugar to 1/2 c.  I subbed vanilla yogurt for the sour cream because that's what I had on hand and added the cinnamon after tasting. The colder it is the better it tastes IMO.

What a lovely treat this is! Served it at a tea party I had, it is so easy and delicious. I made Holland boterkoek from this sight also and used the little left over soup I had to generously drizzle over it the next day. It is a almond butter type cookie/cake. The flavor from this soup was sooo good on the boterkoek!! If you make this for a tea service you should try them together (its best if the boterkoek is a tad warm) Thank you for sharing this:-)

This soup was good and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I didn't LOVE it, but would make it for company if I wanted a light side dish like with a ham casserole.  It was just a little runny so next time I will add less milk and a few more strawberries.  Also, I could really taste the sour cream so next time I will decrease that a bit too.

Not a huge fan...it was okay but tasted too much dairy taste and not enough strawberry taste.  the one i had on royal carribean cruise line was much much better.

Used 2 10oz bags of frozen organic strawberries and upped the sugar to 3T. These were the only changes. Next time I will use half and half instead of cream as the fat was a little too much. However, it was fantastic! My daughter said that we had to add it to our family recipe book because it was the best soup she's ever had (and she loves soup). I served it with cinnamon sugar pita chips which were wonderful crushed slightly and put on top as a garnish. Fantastic!!!  Will definitely make this again and again. . .

It had a good flavor so I liked that but like another person said,it was really like melted strawberry ice cream. Maybe I'll try it on that cruise and find out for myself what that one is like.

This recipe was OK and that's about it. I had a Chilled Strawberry soup on a cruise once and it was absolutley awesome. I wanted to try something similar but this one fell short. I gave it 3 stars and that was being generous.

My husband really liked it. I added a lot of fresh chopped strawberries and make sure it is very chilled. I put it in the freezer for a bit.

This was really good, but I thought it was pretty much a strawberry smoothie/milk shake.  I'm going to freeze the rest in popsicle forms and I think it will be absolutely delicious.
