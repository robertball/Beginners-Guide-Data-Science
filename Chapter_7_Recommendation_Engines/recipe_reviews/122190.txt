I've done this with sliced boiled potatoes, and added 1/2 cup shredded carrot and 1 cup frozen peas (to add vegetables to the dish). Potatoes in the bottom, and potatoes on top and there it went in the oven, bubbling and browning the top. Just delicious, thank you so much for sharing this idea - it's so difficult to find creative choices when cooking with canned tuna! Will definitely make this again!

This was a good recipe! Just right for when you don't want to make a big casserole. I did add more seasonings (garlic, peppers, celery, and dill). I threw in a few broccoli florets and topped with grated cheddar cheese. This is the kind of recipe I like - you can change it up a bit each time to make it a little different :^).  The other nice perk was that it doesn't contain any pasta or rice, so lower in carbohydrates. Thanks!

This recipe was really easy and good however I did change a couple of things: I added a dash of garlic salt and twice as much pepper. I used ritz crackers instead of the potatoe chips and it was awesome! The ritz held the crunch unlike the potatoe chips. I also sprinkled with medium cheddar cheese 10 mins before it was done, just what it needed!

This was ok but not great. Way too much onion - that was practically all there was. If I made it again I would cut down the onion. I feel like it is missing something but I'm not sure what

This is really good! This reminds me of tuna helper but much better and healthier. I did it a bit different though. I did the onions and milk as the directions stated then added 1/4 cup of chopped green and red bell peppers from the garden, a carrot, and a stalk of celery. I didn't have any potato chips so I substituted with cornflakes and french fried onions. I mixed in the stated amount of tuna and pepper,then baked it in a small dish for 20 minutes. 

I didn't have an 8oz baking dish so mine was 8x4 baking dish. It was too big and had a lot of space around the edges, but it didn't hurt anything. 

It turned out creamy and delicious. I'd like to try it with the original ingredients sometime.

This was very good. I substituted smoked salmon for the tuna and added a little cheese on top. I used baked honey mustard potato chips and it a little tangy sweetness. Thanks.

Taste quite good, but I'm not a big fan. Maybe cook it just for once a while

yummy, easy and quick to prepare. The potato chips on the top give it the crunchy touch!
