I think this is a novel variation on cornbread--which is why I tried it, but I was disappointed in the flavor. I like cornbread with spicy foods to temper the spice so there was a little to much heat in here without enough sweet to balance it out. Great texture though. I used vegetable shortening for frying--keeps it vegetarian-friendly.

I toned down the creole seasoning a bit and the results were excellent.

I wanted to give this three stars because it was so much trouble to keep the patties from crumbling apart.  They just completely fell apart as I was placing them on the plate.  However, I love the flavor of this cornbread patty and I will definitely keep the recipe to play with later.  I might try some different types of corn meal, maybe add a bit of flour, and egg or something to see if it will hold together better.

My grandmother made this cornbread all the time and everyone loved it.  We always have it for New Years.  My husband would love to have it every day.  We fry it in bacon grease.  We eat it as regular bread and don't add sugar to it.  The more water you add and the thinner you make it the crispier it is.

Tried this recipe because I was looking for a hush puppy type cornbread to serve with fish.

Glad I made a couple test patties. They were  like little bricks. Added 2 tsp baking powder and about 1/2 tsp salt. Remaining patties were lighter and fluffier.

These are Awesome. They're so quick and simple to make. but, if they get cold they sorta get a weird texture, so keep these babies nice and warm!
