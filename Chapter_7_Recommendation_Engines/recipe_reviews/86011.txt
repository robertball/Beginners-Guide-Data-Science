I had to rate this lower.....because of issues.. Seeing how these are easy to assemble and yet easy to make. The flavor was there....it just lacks easiness to eat for my kids. The sauce in the quesadillas was the down fall for my kids. The quesadillas very very messy for small hands and adult hands too when trying to cut them into 4ths, the sauce being hot squeezed out very where. And the quesadillas barely stayed together. And my kids look like they were playing in finger paint when they were done. I would make these again without the sauce and use the sauce on the side to dip the quesadillas in....so much easier and less of a mess.

Loved this! Made 3 large pizza-dillas for a party tonight and they were fabulous! One was a cheese pizza, a marinara pizza, and a mushroom pizza! They were so great and quick to make! I made all 3 in 30 mins. Just put the finished ones in the oven to keep warm while I made the others. I cooked them in a pan on the stove top so it got nice and crispy, plus I heated up a separate pan to press onto the top of the tortilla as a make-shift panini press.

The children in our daycare center tried this as a cooking activity and absolutely loved it.  We folded one tortilla over and made like a taco - I would not suggest that (the cheese and pepperoni melted out) Overall it was delicious !

These were pretty good considering it's a pizza on tortilla. No one should expect it to taste like an authentic pizza either. I was in a hurry and threw this together. We even used Vegan variations with dairy-free cheese. This is a quick, tasty little snack. Thanks for the recipe ;^)

I made this with a group of elementary school kids and everyone loved it! Since we had so many of them in the oven at one time, they weren't able to get crispy, but they were still good.

I enjoyed this quite a bit.  We did Mozzarella and diced ham for a quick lunch.  I made a homemade pasta/pizza sauce for dipping.  The kids didn't understand it though compared to the original quasadilla so we need to keep serving them to get the kids opinions as they felt betrayed by the promise of pizza this time around.

The girls loved these for dinner tonight! I did not add the marinara , but I did serve it on the side for dipping and they liked that.  Those kid sized tortillas w/ the decals sound fun, but I've never seen them around...Thanks for sharing. :)
