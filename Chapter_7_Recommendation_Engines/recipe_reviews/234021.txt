So close to mine that I had to try this soup. It is very good, I added ground chicken meatballs, cause we like some meat in soup. I used grated goat cheese(lactose intolerant). Very nice flavor, no leftovers. Thank you weelbe for this tasty soup..

Woo-we - this is a great dish!  Knowing from the ingredients that we would like it, I made a double batch.  After 3 stores, trying to find something called Romano beans, I googled it and found out that a flat Italian green bean could be subbed for the Romano beans.  I could not find them in a can, but I did in the frozen section.  I still would like to find the real thing and make this again.  It was very filling and delicious on a cold, snowy, April day.  It was my first time for using ditalini pasta and I bought my first block of fresh Parmigiano Reggiano cheese to grate on the top before serving.  weeble, this is a delicious recipe, that I will for sure be making again.

This was nothing like I have ever had in regard to pasta fagioli soup. The flavor was so good. Subbed turkey bacon and added basil instead of parsley. Wow Weeble this was good.

We really enjoyed this flavourful comforting soup.   Followed the recipe with the exception of omitting the chili pepper.  Next time I will make sure to have some on hand for this dish although it was perfectly delicious without it.  I grated some fresh parmesan on top before serving… Big thumbs up.

Fantastico! I've had this recipe in my rb since before it was even kitchen approved. I don't know why it took so long for me to make but it did not disappoint! I turned it into pasta e ceci because I had so many cans of chick peas in my pantry. This is an easy to prepare recipe with great flavours. Thanks weeble!

Thanks Weeble for the recipe.  I made this as pasta e ceci (pasta and chickpeas) because I didn't have any other beans on hand.  This is a traditional "primo" at most every Italian's house.  After I made this, the aroma reminded me of when you walk into any house in Sicily you smell the aroma of pasta e fagioli at some point, especially in the Spring when beans are used fresh. I remember when we'd sit around the table shucking and tossing them in the pot!  Thanks a bunch.

I had two issues with this. 1. I had a hard time getting the bacon to crisp while cooking with the onions. I finally pulled the bacon out and sautéed it.  2. I'm not sure how pasta e Fagioli is supposed to taste but this tasted a lot like bean and bacon soup. It was very filling and not a bad just not my taste.

We enjoyed this soup! A tasty and fast dinner. I omitted the bacon but used bacon fat to saute the onion, and I added carrots and celery as well. I used vegetable stock for the chicken stock.  I added some fresh oregano I had as well.

This is a wonderful soup, and comes together quickly and easily.  I used the Roman beans (found them in the Goya section) as per the recipe, and made everything else as written.  The only thing I changed was to stir some fresh spinach into the finished soup until it wilted.  Fantastic---served with garlic bread this is a perfect meal for a cold / damp weeknight!  Thanks!!

Delicious flavor. Broth wasn't as thick as I thought it would be, but it still was delicious with the crusty bread

Very tasty and satisfying soup. I made it as written except for the Romano cheese, which I didn't have, so I used a bit of grated gouda. It tasted even better when reheated for lunch the next day. Thanks for sharing!

This was okay but I thought it needed something more.  I added minced garlic, and oregano.

I certainly will make this again and again. This reminded me of the dish I had growing up in an Italian family, minus the bacon,  but I made it exactly as written.  It is so good and so filling. Loved it!!
