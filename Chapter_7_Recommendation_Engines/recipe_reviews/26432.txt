Good recipe...just a few notes.  For "traditional" stock, use poultry seasoning and bay leaves instead of dill.  Also, I suggest removing the fat from the chicken first.  It's advisable to bring the chicken to a boil first in order to remove the scum (impurities) from the top of the pot.  You should remove as much scum as possible then add the vegetables.  This makes for a clearer stock.  I also add coarsly chopped celery leaves as they add a lot of flavour.  You can also add chopped parsley.  I cook up a big pot and freeze 2 cup portions for later use in cream soups, chowders and gravies.  You'll just need to add more salt after it defrosts.

I've never thought about adding dill to my stock - I'll have to try that some time.  Just a note: it is not necessary to peel and/or chop your vegetables before adding them.  Just wash them good and throw 'em in!  (You're going to toss them in the end anyway.)  You don't even have to peel your onion (the skin darkens the stock nicely).  You can add any/all vegetables that are languishing in the vegetable bin to this stock.  I freeze my stock in ice cube trays, then pop them out and put them in freezer bags.  You use just a little or a lot that way and there's no waste.  Thanks for posting this Leah.

This made great chicken stock and was pleased with the over all result but the dill added a "mystery" flavor that I didn't care for.  Next time I will leave out the dill.Okay...I have to add on to my review.  If you are looking for a soup that will kick a cold than this is the recipe...DILL and all...I boosted mine today with a some fresh garlic since we all have the coughs - this soup does the trick when you feel sick!!!

Pretty bland.  Not a fan of the dill,  it gave it a funny flavour.  However, I did use dried dill weed.  My kids normally love chicken soup.  But neither one would eat this.

Leah, you saved the day. I am an newlywed and my husband had his first cold as a married man. Fortuantely I was able to make some "Jewish Penecillin" and now he's cured. He said my (your) chicken soup was better than his mothers and calls it my "Four Star Chicken Soup!"

Leah, this soup brings back many wonderful memories of family and holiday gatherings.  It is very similar to my mother's except for the Dill - which adds a nice touch.  I will be making this for the Holidays tonight with both noodles and matzah balls added, as is our family tradition.
Thank you again for such a great recipe.

Add a peeled parsnip split lengthwise to soup pot. This give a gardeny taste.  Discard after cooking with all other veggies.

The real deal.  Chicken soup the way my grandma and mom made it, and the way I've just started to make it myself.

I was looking for an easy recipe, this recipe fits the bill.  I wanted low carb, check.  I thought the soup is bland.  I read the other reviews and they are all helpful and true.  Next time I will add a little salt, boil the chicken first ( I did remove as much skin as possible before so my broth was pretty clear).  I won't spend so much time chopping putting things in whole or chopping  less was a good idea I read.  I used less water and used a can of chicken broth low sodium.  I did not change anything else.  Overall, the recipe is simple but lacks flavor to me.  I am not sure if my taste buds are ruined by salty can soup but I still like the recipe.  I think it gives my beginner status room to try some other things like different seasoning. l try this again.

I loved this soup so much.  It was the first time I ever made chicken noodle soup.  Very easy recipe.  I didn't have any dill so I used basil.  I even made it again since then.

So easy and quick, inexpensive too! I save chicken parts when I trim a chicken, just for soup! I did use dill seed and it tastes wonderful, makes the house smell homey on a cold day... I did add peppercorns since its easier to strain and I have an abundance.
