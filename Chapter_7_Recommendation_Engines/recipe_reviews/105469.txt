My family loves this pie!  Instead of the the lemon extract, I add extra lemon juice (juice of two lemons plus the zest of one).  It's a great substitute for my mom's old fashion lemon chiffon that had lots of sugar and eggs.

Delightful.  Used low fat evaporated milk, put in wine glasses and topped with Lite Cool Whip.  Made a fabulous Phase I South Beach Diet dessert which my guests loved.

Made this for my diabetic father in law (using a graham cracker crust made with splenda for baking).  The amn doesn't eat much and every time I make this he has 2 pieces!

I am a diabetic. This is the best tasting recipe I have ever had. My whole family loves this pie and they can't tell it takes Splenda. I hope to see more recipes like this one that is tasty on this site.
