Absolutely love this recipe...a very satisfying breakfast...holds you over until dinner ! One change I made was I preheated the oven to 450 degrees F and omitted the chipotle peppers.

This recipe was great! Very tasty with refried beans and everything! One thing I would change next time is just crack the egg right on the tostada and refried beans. I cooked mine beforehand as instructed and they came out with the yolks nearly fully cooked and I like mine runny. To each their own though! Also, I just bought some fancy-ish salsa from Walmart and spooned it one the tostadas after they were done baking. Still good! Another thing, I actually just bought corn tortillas instead of tostadas and put a little butter on the bottom of them then baked them. All of the tostadas at Walmart looked like they were already broken but with this method they still came out flavorful and crunchy!

Great recipe! I omitted the side of black beans As I felt the refried beans took care of business. I will definitely make this again

Being a hot summer day, I heated the tortillas in a cast iron skillet then added the refried beans and cheese then topped with fried egg and salsa. Worked fine!

I followed this recipe exactly. I just wish I’d had more people over to eat this recipe. It was A LOT of food but we definitely won’t have to worry about breakfast for the next couple of days. Saved!

So easy and so delicious. I have been wanting huevos rancheros since I visited a friend in Albuquerque about a year ago, and these hit the spot!

Made this for my husband this morning; he liked them. I am a whimp when it comes to spicy food therefore I seeded the peppers that were in adobo sauce, used my favorite salsa verde and they were just right for my whimpy tastebuds. Would I make them again......absolutely.

If you bake at 500 F for 10 minutes, they will be burned to a crisp. Bake at 350 for 5 minutes and check on them.

I forgot the black beans and the peppers, but the recipe was still very tasty. I will add black beans next time. the only thing I changed was I baked the tostadas for only 4 minutes. I'm pretty sure they would have burned otherwise. The cheese was completely melted at 3 minutes at 500 degrees. Next time I will use 400 degrees for a bit longer.

This came out great. I couldn’t find Cilantro at the local store so not sure if that would have made any difference. Also I partially cooked the eggs on the stovetop as I was concerned the eggs would be over cooked. This recipe got a thumbs up from my family.

Fabulous - Spicy- but really really good.  Followed the recipe - excluded Cilantro as no one my house really likes it.  
As others indicated, the Black Beans are not necessary the dish is filling itself without them and I would fry my eggs for maybe a one less minute as they were a bit more cooked than I like.
All in all, great breakfast and easy to serve to a large group at once.

Holy guacamole this is spicy! And I like spicy! I added more salsa to the chipotle mixture and added sliced avocados on the top. Also made my own tostadas. Good recipe. Will make again but use less Chipotle’s. Thank you!

Fantastic!! The hubs loves sausage so added cooked hot jimmy dean sausage to beans also lowered temp to 465 as we like our egg yolks runny - then followed recipe to the tee. Huge hit for Father's day breakfast - and so filling!!!

Pretty great recipe. I'm only a fan of salsa if I buy it from authentic mexican markets. I don't like any of the name brand salsa stuff so if you're like me, I suggest replacing the salsa with soy chorizo. It was very good made that way.

A fantastic base recipe for the huevos rancheros!   I omitted the side of black beans, I think the refried were enough beans for me :)  YUM!
