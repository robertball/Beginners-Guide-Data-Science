I absolutely love to try different recipes and especially ones that come from mothers. :)  This recipe is to die for!  I'll never make my hot wings the same!  Thank you!

My family really liked this, although I had to improvise a little.  I used 1tsp of ground tumeric and 1 1/2 tbs ground red pepper.  I also started it on the grill, grilled it for about 20 minutes, then ran out of propane, and moved it to the oven, covered in foil at 450 for about 20 min.  I also did some chicken breasts with the wings, and they were really good.  I served it with a rice dish I do and a tossed green salad.  I was thinking about adding some vinegar or wine to the marinade next time to add a little zing.

I modified this recipe slightly to marinade chicken thighs and it turned out wonderful. Of course, they took a bit longer to cook, but they were worth the wait. I left out the sugar because of personal tastes and replaced it with about a tablespoon of tomato juice. Also added some extra pepper. The chicken was really juicy and tender.

The flavor is a nice change from the traditional wings.  I was afraid I would make the marinade too spicy and only used one red pepper (double the recipe).  Not spicy at all, will use 2 peppers next time.

These were awesome.  They're our new favorite chicken wing style.  The baking leaves them the perfect tenderness.  Everyone, even the kids, loved these!

Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe! The non-recipe thing always stops me from trying out different dishes. I used 1/2 tsp ground turmeric and 1/2 a medium onion for the shallot. Wonderful, wonderful. Thank you!
UPDATED: I made it and the kids like it too! I didn't put the chili pepper so it's not spicy. This dish is full of flavor.  I have to tell you that I'm Indonesian and now I know how to make this. Thanks :)

I loved these wings so much I couldn't stop eating them! I put the garlic, shallot, and turmeric root in the food processor along with a red jalapeño (this was the only red chile pepper that the store had). Once everything was  finely chopped, I added the rest of the ingredients and marinated for an hour. 

I baked the wings according to the recipe, except I put them under the broiler for a minutes at the end to achieve a nice golden brown color. Next time I think I'd add 1/4 tsp more of brown sugar for a sweeter flavor and I'd marinate for longer than an hour. My wings were not spicy at all but that may be because of the type of pepper I used. Thank you for this recipe!

I used chicken thighs and cooked it a few minutes longer. I couldn't find a fresh  red chili pepper, so I used a green jalapeno instead. It was awesome! You might want to wear gloves wile preparing the turmeric root, as it will stain your hands. I will make again!

I just received a mortal and pestle as a gift, and found this recipe to try it out.  I had to sub tumeric powder for root. I was worried that the wings would be too spicy for my family, but they were quite mild with the pepper seeds left out. Simple recipe that was fun to make!

This was delicious and I needed a use for fresh turmeric so it was perfect. I didn't think there was enough marinade but I stuck it all in a ziplock bag with the chicken and squished it a bit and after it sat in the fridge for a bit it was perfect.

I think the marinade was alright.  The flavor was pretty mild overall and baking them makes it seem like you are eating roasted chicken instead of fried chicken, which is how I prefer my wings.  Perhaps I could have broiled them.

I made this recipe tonight and everyone loved it.  I had to substitute a couple of things, and it still turned out great!  I used scallions instead of a shallot and crushed red pepper in place of the pepper it called for.  I was in a hurry, so the chicken did not get to marinate but for a few minutes.  I started it out in a pan on the stove and then put it in the oven for just a few minutes.  It was tender and wonderfully flavorful.  I will definitely make this recipe again!
