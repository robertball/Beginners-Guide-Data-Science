Use Egg Beaters instead of raw eggs.  They are a safe alternative.

Excellent flavor. Fudge-like texture. I had twice as much chocolate mixture as I did crumb mixture. The crumbs just fell off the bottem making them very messy. I think the recipe should be a chocolate layer, then a crumb layer, then another chocolate layer. That way the crumbs wouldn't fall all over when trying to eat.
