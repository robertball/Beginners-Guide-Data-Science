Did recipe as written except removed the condensed milk, it was fantastic without, and used some frozen shredded potatoes (only had one whole potato). Used leftover white fish of sorts, and made for a great meal out of something I hate eating (leftover fish...yuk).  Everyone (1 yr old, 2 yr old, 13 yr. old, 35 yr olds) liked it. 

No where in this recipe was there sweetness to it....joshcoctions used sweetened condensed milk...bet you never do that again.

I found this awesome and easy and I live in Glosta!! I keep seeing comments w/ condensed milk...It's evaporated milk. Big difference..Maybe that's why it was "cloyingly sweet" joshcocations! Add a cornstarch/water mixture if you want it thicker!

Yummy! Just made this and it was tasty!!! The only things I enhanced was, added celery...you gotta have celery in soup, garlic powder, and a sprinkle of smoked paprika on top when serving. Husband made some roasted garlic croutons which added a delicious flavor. It's a keeper and really simple to prepare.

This was good. I followed the suggestion of one other person and added a little cream and left out the milk. I did use the condensed milk.   My husband cleaned his bowl, and that's always the key to whether I will make it again.  A lot of times something I think is great gets a so-so reaction from him.

Great soup! Was in a hurry so I used precooked bacon and 3 cups diced frozen potatoes. I also used chicken stock in place of the water and added 2 Tbsp flour to pot after onions were soft to help thicken. Is it possible Joshcoctions may have used sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated??? Our chowder wasn't sweet and I know I always have to read the label to make sure I'm grabbing the right one! :)

So good! I did add a pinch os Old Bay, used only half the bacon and salt, and omitted the pat of butter. I do like my chowder thickened, but realize that others like this thinner version. If you are in the thick camp, mix 6 tablespoons of flour and 1/2 cup of h

I also added celery with the onions, can of corn with the red potatoes and sprinkled with paprika before serving.  DELICIOUS!!!   Served with garlic bread.  I cannot wait until tomorrow.  I bet the leftovers are going to be divine with a bag of  Ceasar salad I plan to pick up tomorrow morning.

I had some leftover fish and wanted to make something creamy with it and this hit the spot. A few changes-- instead of evaporated milk and milk, I used a can of reduced fat cream of celery and reduced fat cream of mushroom soup and then one cup of 2% milk. I also added garlic powder and a bag of frozen corn. I had freshly-caught steelhead, which is not a white fish but it still tasted great in this soup. Was delicious with a crusty bread and my husband had two helpings. Will definitely make this again!

Pretty good as is. I drained about 2/3 of the bacon grease before adding leeks instead of onions. It was still plenty rich. I think I would add some corn to it to make heartier.

I made this exactly as written and it was cloyingly sweet.  I ended up straining all the broth and tried making it again without the evaporated milk. It made slightly better but was still inedible.
