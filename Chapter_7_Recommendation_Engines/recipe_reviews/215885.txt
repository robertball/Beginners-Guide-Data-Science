Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as it's written. The only thing is i'll probably double the Tomato/Basil sauce next time. Oh, and I used Bertoli since that's our favorite brand around here. Just a few extra notes...check the eggplant constantly when on the skillet because they burn easily. Also, this took me a lot longer than 15 minutes to prep. Otherwise, awesome recipe!

One complaint.  Prep time of 15minutes is rediculous...clser to one hour. Otherwise meal is great.  I used Italian bread crumbs plus Italian seasoning.  I also added fresh basel to the Classico sauce.
