Combine this recipe with this more traditional one http://www.grouprecipes.com/38465/shakshuka.html  and woo hooo. You wont be able to stop making it... If you have access to a middle eastern grocery store sprinkling with Za'atar spice mix really makes it so tasty... Or you can make your own as well... This recipe is awesome on its own but you should try the more traditional way sometime just for fun!

I am a big fan of shakshuka but like this recipe, I like to improvise on just about any recipe I read.  Just some options for you all... I make it a few ways but my favorite is made by using 28oz can of fire roasted tomatoes w green chilies.  I add baby Bella mushrooms, heads of asparagus and onions to the sauce along with garlic, cumin and spicy paprika.  I have even used okra in place of asparagus if you want to go another route.  If I am unhappy with spice level I will add some chipotle to give it some kick or throw some dried chilies into the mix. Salt and pepper to taste. Add parsley on top and enjoy.

This is a variation of a very old Italian dish my Grandmother made. Of course, she used left over pasta sauce from Sundays dinner & served it with crunchy italian bread toast!

I thought this was very good - a nice change of pace breakfast dish that works exceptionally well for those "breakfast for dinner" days! I cut down to two servings, using a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  The paprika, which I normally don't like, added a nice background flavor.  Only other change was to add a teeny pinch of sugar to the tomatoes to cut the acidity.  I liked this a lot and will make again! Thanks, Lisa!

Just made this dish for the second time this morning.  It is awesome...my husband and I love it.  I used one can of stewed/seasoned tomatoes (oregano, celery, basil) and one can of diced tomatoes (no salt or seasoning added).  This provided just the right amount af seasoning for us.

This was very good. If you like eggs with salsa you'll like this dish. I served mine with flour tortillas as I didn't have time to make pita bread. I had trouble getting the egg to cook on top though and finally had to cover the pan after more than five minutes of cooking and the whites on top were still transparent. I didn't have whole tomatoes so I used chunky crushed tomatoes. I diced up my onion and peppers very small as I prefer them that way. I will definitely make this again, it was very very good. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, what a great dish!

I made this for dinner last night. It was very simple and tasty but not as spicy as I would have liked.  I did use regular jalapenos since I couldn't find pickled.  I will make again and play around with some spices.

This is a beautiful dish, but In the video, she is cooking this dish in a cast iron skillet. That is a no-no!  Acidic foods like tomatoes can react with the metal in a cast-iron skillet and absorb iron molecules from the pan. The greater the acidity of the food and the longer you cook it, the more iron is transferred to the food.

Pretty good with a slice of toast, since we didn't have pita or tortilla. Also didn't have paprika or cumin, so I basically did the following...sauteed garlic, onion, and 1 jalapeno in olive oil, then stirred in a 14-oz can of fire-roasted tomatoes with some cayenne and garlic powder, a handful of cherry tomatoes, and 5 pieces of pickled jalapeno diced. After sauteing a while, it got dry, so I added a dash of tomato sauce and maybe 1/4-1/2 cup of chicken stock. After about 15 minutes total, I cracked 4 eggs into a small bowl and slid them in, then covered and cooked for 2-3 minutes more. The yolks were runny and it was perfect. I spooned them onto a plate and topped with crumbled feta.

I made Shakshuka for 12 people last night in less then an hour. This recipe is indeed easy and fast. 

When I went to the grocey store though I couldn't find pickeld Jalapeno peppers. Not having time to do something with lives Jalapeno, I add crushed red pepper and double the garlic to increase the spice level.

This is pretty good! I actually skipped the veg. oil and I only had tomato sauce, so I used that instead. I also didn't have pita bread, but I had some Cheesy Italian Bread (from this site) and I put the whole thing over that. It was easy to convert to a single serving, and I felt like I had a tasty, fairly low-fat meal.

Healthy, home-made and delicious! Excellent substitute for your regular breakfast menu. Also this dish can be served for lunch or dinner. For all those who like Indian cuisine, you can add a pinch or two of 'garam masala' for more flavour.

This was great!  I used a frozen pepper and onion mix, which made it super-easy!  Like the video suggests, I used the fire-roasted tomatoes.  I also added a teaspoon of cumin.  I didn't have feta, so I added some shredded cheddar just a few minutes before it was done.  It had a great smoky taste, and tasted delicious with some toasted French bread.  I love this easy, economical meal!  We will be having it again.

I tried this dish, using crushed tomatoes because that's what I had.  It was still great.  Didn't have pita bread, so I made garlic bread.  Delicious!

I made this yesterday morning for breakfast.  It took a little bit longer to make then our normal Sunday morning breakfast, but it was a nice change.  I had all the ingredients in my pantry.  The only change to the recipe was the addition of salt and pepper.   Served it with a pita bread.  Thanks for sharing.  It is always fun to try new things.

First time ever making shakshuka. Very good base recipe. I used what I had in the house - diced Cajun tomatoes, half an onion... added cumin, both spicy and smoked paprika, turmeric and chili powder. We had some garlic naan bread in the freezer and it was fantastic with the naan! I will be making this again and again.

This is a solid recipe, but mine came out too sour/acidic. I think it was all down to the can of tomatoes I used. I will make this again with a different brand or with sweeter fresh tomatoes when they come out. I still enjoyed it and it looks and smells great. Thank you.

This turned out fantastic! I changed this recipe quite a bit, hence the 4 stars.  To the sauce I added salt and pepper, cumin, a splash of red wine and a pinch of sugar.  While the sauce was simmering, I browned up some chorizo and added it to the sauce while it simmered. Also I steamed some chopped asparagus and chopped kale, then added it to the sauce at the end along with some feta. The eggs didn't cook very well, next time I will fry then separately and add it afterwards. But wow! This turned out amazing! My husband was thoroughly impressed and he doesn't normally have a very adventurous palate. I think this recipe is a good starting point, but needs some additions to make it exceptional.

this was very good, but the eggs took awhile to set. ended up putting a lid on to speed them up. Next time I will just do the eggs separate. Did use the tomatoes with basil and garlic per other suggestions.
