I made as directed and my fudge didn't completely set up.   Even after freezing it was gooey (but excellent).   I'm pretty sure that I didn't boil the full 5 minutes as directed in the recipe, so my advice to everyone is to follow the recipe as written and make sure you boil for 5 minutes!

I made half a batch of these and took them to teachers, and they scarfed them down with many compliments.  They are really tasty!  I used the Reynolds no stick foil on the bottom of an 8x8 pan and followed the recipe.  When you are ready to pour the cooked mixture over the graham cracker crust, you need to have everything else ready for the topping because it gets set quite quickly.  Now I will be making a full batch using gluten-free crackers, and I'm sure these will be gone as quickly as the ones I made today.  Be sure to add these to your Christmas cookie platter!  You'll get compliments galore!  Thanks, Hershey's Kitchens!

Fantastic bars! Were a total hit with coworkers! The only thing I would do differently is use mini chocolate chips on top vs. regular size. The chunks were a little too big for the soft bars. Other than that, the recipe is PERFECT!

Everyone loved these! I made these for Christmas and they were a hit - most of my family has celiac so I used gluten free graham crackers. The fudge was kind of gummy as I was spreading it on the graham cracker crust , was worried the texture would be off after it set but it was fine. These are very rich, I served small pieces. Definitely would make this again!

I plan to make these, but only with some brand of dark chocolate. I never use milk chocolate if I can use dark instead-which is always!

Very quick to put together. Hubby was a fan. Pretty sweet. If I make again I would consider leaving the chocolate chips off the top and including toasted pecans.

So easy to make and has the wow factor! I didn't put the chocolate chips on top, just the toffee bits. However I think some toasted pecans or walnuts on top would be perfect. Thanks Hershey's!

Will be making my second batch of these tonight.  I did two things a little different, one was when the topping chips were melting, I spread them around so as not to lose any toffee bits!  My favorite part! The other was I used dark chocolate for both chips. Can cut these into much smaller pieces than 24.

Made this for my sister when she was in town.  It tasted so great and was very easy to make.  I would recommend this for the fudge lovers out there.  It was so good.  It is worth reading the recipe over thoroughly before making this and having the toppings measured out into a bowl before you are ready to pour because you will want to get the toppings on as soon as possible after pouring into your pan.
