We loved it! The only substitution was a little finely minced white onion instead of scallions. I do agree that the dressing does need time to develop its flavour.

'Not my first broccoli salad, but first with curry & pepper.  'Didn't care for it.  No specific reason.  Just didn't grab me.  'Liked the idea of dried crans in there.

Great flavour twist on a potluck favourite!!  Could not bring myself to add the cayenne pepper and for me, hot enough with the madras curry powder I used.  Garnish with a few cranberries and walnuts. : ) 4.5 stars!
