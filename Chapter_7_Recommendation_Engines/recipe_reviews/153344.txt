Very cute!  I made these for my son's preschool class & decorated them with umbrellas, teddy grahams (with icing bathing suits), and kix cereal decorated to look like beach balls.  Easy and fun for kids.

I made these yesterday for a luau birthday party for my cousin (well more for the kids at the party). The kids loved them because they are so cute but the adults ended up eating most of them before the kids got to them. I used juju fish and sour worms. I also made some with chocolate pudding. Next time I think I may use some blue food coloring in the vanilla pudding to make the pudding blue so it looks like water!! So cute!!

Made these for my two kids to take to school for their birthday treats. Their teachers said that they were a huge hit with all of the kids.  Made sure that they were refrigerated until it was treat time. The kids really enjoyed the little umbrellas and I found little tye-dyed gummi bears instead of the worms. Loved this recipe!

YUMMY, QUICK AND EASY!  Living at the shore, I was looking for a dessert that would carry a seashore theme.  These sand cups were the answer.  They were very tasty and easy to make.  I used Swedish Fish Aquarium Life candy to decorate.  Thank you Jell-o for sharing your recipe!

This was a great dessert!  I had my teenage daughter make them for my sister's bridal shower and they were a hit!  My sister lives in Florida so the beach theme was perfect.  
So easy to make and such a great conversation piece.
