I made this recipe for a Christmas dinner with my family. Not only did *I* think it was marvelous, more importantly, everyone else raved as well. I increased the garlic and lemon juice and didnt have any bay leaves so I just left them out. It was so moist, so tender, and so flavorful. I set it to marinate at 10 a.m. and put it on to cook at 6 p.m. the same day. I can only imagine how wonderful it would have been if I would have waited longer to cook. 
Will try this on other cuts of pork!! Thanks!!

I used the basic receipe and did a 48 hour marinade. Then I cooked the whole bonless pork loin on my offset firebox slow cooker. It took approx. 8 to 9 hrs. I used an electronic meat thermometer and when the pork reached 156 degrees I called it done. It was the most moist roast I have ever tasted. I sliced it thin and served it on good rolls with fresh horseradish. (Five Stars)

It took less than 10 minutes to put the marinade together.... the aroma was 
wonderful.  After 24 hours I roasted the pork tenderloin and it was so tender 
you could cut it with a fork.  My dinner party of 6 raved about the pork.  Since 
there was no additional instructions for a gravy, I used the same kind of wine 
that I roasted the pork in and made a sauce with scallops as a side dish which 
my guests could use as gravy for their pork if they wanted..... but truthfully no 
sauce (gravy) was necessary... it was just so tender!

I made this recipe following all the instructions and everyone raved about it. I wouldn't recommend marinating it for any longer than it states in the recipe.  I might even suggest not marinating longer than 4 hours.

I changed this recipe slightly, I used apple jusice instead of wine, and I was only able to marinate for about 2 hours. But I batsed the roast with the marinade as it cooked, and it came out delicious!

Excellent!  I used white wine vinegar, which was suggested by others.  My husband said several times during the meal how good this was.  Will make this again.

This was very good.  The onions absorb the wine flavor and the sauce and onions (marinade) are really good over mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again.  Oh, I made the whole roast in a crock pot and cooked it in the marinade.  Came out really tender.

We used a whole tenderloin (about 9 pounds), so I used a whole bottle of wine and doubled the rest of the recipe.  I added a good handful of chopped fresh parsley & a little fresh basil along with  some rosemary, marjoram and celery salt.  We slow cooked this on the grill.  This was the hit of the party and has been requested (more like DEMANDED) for the next party.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I let this marinate for two days and it was as tough as beef jerky.  The cut of meat was excellent so I do not know where it went wrong.  It was also not nearly as flavorful as it smelled.  The smell was incredibly enticing but the end product was dull in flavor.  Certainly not able to cut with a fork alone as some reviewers claim!  Needs definite rejiggering!

I made this in the slow cooker, without marinading it beforehand, and it turned out great.  Very flavorful.  I modified the recipe slightly based on what I had:  I used only half an onion; 4 bay leaves; 2 cloves of garlic; no thyme and instead used 1/8 t. dill weed; only 1 1/2 T. olive oil; and added about six carrots, cut in large pieces.  I used Pinot Grigio as my wine.  My three-year-old ate everything on his plate.

This recipe was OK.  I allowed it to marinate for two days and while it was very tender, I didn't find it as flavorable as we had hoped.  Most likely will not use again.

There wasn't much flavor for all the work.  Brining usually gives me more flavor and makes it moister.  It's not bad, just not great either.  Might try it for beef roast though.

This recipe was awesome.  What I did was cooked the loin in the marinade in my slow cooker on low for 8 hours.  I pulled the pork and served it on buns with barbecue sauce, onions, and pickles on the side??YUM

Before putting It in the roasting pan, I patted the roast dry and rubbed it with some Dijon Mustard and oil.  It made a lovely crust.  Everyone raved about how tender it was.  This is a keeper for sure.

This was really good, I normally find roast pork very dry, but I  marinated this overnight, and it was so juicy, and what a wonderful flavor, I will definitely make this again.

Although this marinade was very easy, the end result was just ok, not great, not a lot of flavor except from the garlic placed in the slits. I will not use this recipe again.

I didn't use thyme but used everything else. The broth made into a sour gravy but went okay with the pork. Unfortunately, marinating the pork for 24 hours, it was still dry and tasteless. Won't make it again.

I am a garlic lover.  However,   I think the garlic  over powered the pork  I do cook with  wine,  but  maybe  red  would make a difference I will not again.  Did not tasted like pork!

I made this for my daughter's birthday party in July. It was delicious.  I didn't change a thing.  The pork was very moist. Every one loved it so much that we had none left for leftovers.
