My husband thinks this recipe deserves 5 stars.  I did not follow the recipe exactly, though.  I made it gluten-free, for one, using BRM GF all-purpose flour.  And I did not use milk and instant coffee granules.  Instead I used a cup of strong cold coffee.  And I replaced the cinnamon (which me and my baby cannot have) with allspice and nutmeg. This recipe was just what I was looking for, and I was happy to find it!

I made these exactly as written and they turned out well.  Good taste and nice presentation.  Next time I will increase the amount of coffee granules and will absolutely keep the topping on for that coffee-shop look.  After reading the reviews all I can say to beginning bakers is to try any recipe as written first as your jumping off point.  If something does not turn out to your liking then make subsitutions or what have you the second time around.

Absolutely fantastic as is! I hate to see people change half the ingredients and leave their comments here, it doesn't help people gauge the recipe very well. As it turns out, I don't think this recipe needs anything changed. I could only see adding a smidge more coffee if you like a really strong coffee taste. 

I didn't have enough in the way of muffin pans, so I had to condense down to only 12 muffins, but they turned out excellent!. The first thing I thought was "wow, they look just as good if not better than the store bought ones!"

Fabulous recipe!

I made it with out the topping, the recipe was yummy but i excluded the topping because of the calories i knew it would be. I counted all the calories up & it was 2730/12 muffins = 228 per muffin with out the topping! Yummy but not that great if your a calorie counter.

I made this muffin recipe with a friend this weekend. It came out really good. Instead of the instant coffee, we used a capppuccino  dry mix instead. Also, the muffins came out a little burnt at the bottom. So, next time I make these (and there will be a next time!), I'll keep a closer look on the time they are in the oven. All in all, a great recipe. The choco chips in the muffins were a big hit.

Excellent!!!  I got rave reviews!  I only changed one thing. I haved the slour on the topping and added a teaspoon of instant granules to the topping as well.  Mmmm...

Great base recipe.  I just use a little less butter, a little more coffee, and skipped the topping (didn't crumble well for me) and used butter cream frosting instead.  Either way, very good and flavorful treat.

THESE WERE DELICIOUS! i will deffinitley make them again and again. there just soo good. First time i mad them i didn't have the instant coffee or the chocolate chips on hand, so i imply made them with just cinnamon and they stillame out sooo good. I made some mini muffins fo my in-laws and my parents, and thy were a huge hit. also my husband a "not-such-a-muffin-guy" loved them. After getting some coffee and chocolate chps i made them again and they came out even better. i have to say i didnt really like the chocolate chips in the mini muffins because they kind of killed the cappacion taste, so probably next time i'll avoid the chocolate chips.

Really good...made exactly as is...esp good if you nuke it in the microwave for 15-20 seconds and serve w/butter! Good for breakfast, but tastes more like dessert!

Really nice, a mix between sweet and savory.... I followed the recipe except for using 1c flour and 1c bisquick mix, adding 2T cocoa instead of chocolate chips and did 3T of instant coffee.  (skipped the topping). Very tasty and a huge hit. It's going in the perma recipe file!!!

Excellent muffins.  Not a strong coffee flavor.  I added oatmeal since the batter was a bit too runny.

These are really good and so simple to make.  I used canola oil instead of melted butter and skipped the topping to avoid the extra calories.  Next time I will make them without chocolate chips so I can taste more of the coffee flavor.

Really good, very easy!
My own personal opinion, I could have gone without the chocolate chips. I think next time I will try cinnamon chips instead!

These had a nice flavor. The only change I made was that I used freshly ground espresso. The texture was the problem for me as they were very dry and didn't hold up beyond the. Day that they were made.

So delicious! Aside from adding an extra tsp of coffee granules as other reviewers suggested, I followed the recipe exactly. I might try with raisins instead of chocolate chips next time for a "breakfast" type muffin.

These came out very good.  I substituted 1/4 cup canola oil for the butter and they came out very nice and light.  Delicious!

Hubby says these were most excellent! Could use 3/4 chips; it was pretty jammed with them. I made 12 muffins (must fill more next time; they didn't rise a lot), 12 minis, and an extra ramekin. I used a full Tbs of coffee granules, and it could stand up to 4 tsp. Baked up with a nice crust on them. Delicious!

I really did a bad job on these! I over mixed and over cooked them, but everyone went nuts over them! I would recomend adding the chips with the liquids to avoid over-mixing, also watch them closely, the time was a little long. I will add more coffee next time, and not add as much cinnamon, but that is a personal preferance. As is, my kids loved them, but they are more a dessert, not breakfast. Try them!!

EXCELLENT! Used white and brown splenda in place of the sugars.  Did not use the crumb topping.  Made the cappuccino spread from razzle dazzle recipes:  4 oz chunked cream cheese, 1 T splenda, 1/2 t instant coffee granules, 1/2 t vanilla, 1/4 c mini choc chips--process in blender--thinned with milk or cream.

These are scrumptious!  I have tried them with the coffee granules and with instant cappucino powder.  Both are wonderful, but the cappucino powder is my favorite.  I love the streusel as well, but these muffins are so good, the streusel is not necessary .  YUM!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent flavor!  I made a couple of modifications after reading reviews: 1/4 cup sugar & 1/4 cup brown sugar, I used skim milk, & I used 1/4 cup nonfat yogurt & 1/4 canola oil, a few handsful of choc chips (I didn't measure). I baked it in a loaf pan 350 for 55 minutes & used 1/2 of the topping. Delicious! I made it for breakfast but not sure if it will make it until the morning with my boys around:)

As it is, I found this to be very disappointing.  I was expecting a wonderful cappucino flavour and the chocolate chips and topping completely overwhelmed that.  I have made this again omitting the chocolate chips, increasing the amount of coffee granules to 2 TBS (I want it to taste like a Cappucino), and just sprinkling sugar on top to allow that coffee flavour to come through.  Yum.

These are amazing! I even forgot the baking powder but got rave reviews from my boyfriend. I had no instant coffee on hand so I used a cappuccino mix and had great results. I will make this recipe many times again.

I did lighten these up just a touch, so I didn't feel AS guilty that my boys had chocolate for breakfast. I used whole wheat white flour, cut both sugars down to a quarter cup, I used lowfat buttermilk, 1/4 cup plain nonfat yogurt for half the butter, and I cut the chocolate chips down by half. These turned out well though next time, I might cut back on the cinnamon, add a little more instant coffee and I'd use vegetable oil instead of butter.

These muffins are easy to make and delicious. With four grown men living in my house they were gone in less than eight hours. That's how I know they were good. The perfect breakfast muffin they taste like french toast and coffee...How can you go wrong?

At first I wasn't sure if I'd like these since I only bake things that I know are great.. the coffee flavor was really strong in the batter, but the chocolate chips DEFINITELY made it the perfect sweetness and the topping melts right on into the top. I'm really excited that I chose this recipe for a brunch I'm going to tomorrow- they'll be a hit. Keep a glass of milk handy:)  One thing I think may have made a difference was I used Starbucks' VIA, as that's all the instant coffee I had in the house and didn't want to buy a whole thing for 1 recipe- the coffee is certainly strong, but that's fine by me:) Also, I got 12 full muffins and 6 minis out of this.

I love coffee and was so excited about these muffins, but they lack the coffee flavor I was hoping.  I even doubled the amount of coffee it called for, with not a whole lot of noticable taste.  I did change a few of the porpotions, and they had a wonderful texture.  I added 1/4 tsp salt more, 1 extra egg, and 1/4 tsp baking soda.  I am so glad I halved the amount of cinnamon.  The chocolate chips really do take away from the flavor, I would drizzle some chocolate on top if you want it.  I also cut back the flour on the topping.  My daughter loved these, i thought they were okay.

Made this into a 9 x 5 loaf for 45 minutes. I had to use 1 cup of white sugar instead of brown. Would have been better with the brown. I increased the coffee to 3 tablespoons. Replaced 1/2 the butter with applesauce. Added two tablespoons of ground flax. And replaced egg with 2 egg whites. Great coffee flavor comes through with the three tablespoons of coffee.

Delicious!! I used Egg Beaters in place of the egg and substituted canola oil for the butter. You have to melt the butter anyway, so why not make it healthier by using canola oil. We do not use chocolate chips in our home due to the cocoa butter, so I used 2 Tbsp. of cocoa powder in its' place. Also took some to work and everyone loved them.

Really good and a snap to whip up.  I did increase instant coffee to 1T, 1t, and changed liquid to 1/4 cup coffee (prepared) with 3/4 cup milk.  Also used some coffee extract that I had instead of vanilla.

These really were delightful muffins.  I did make a few changes.  As some reviews were saying these did not have enough coffee flavor I used coffee extract in place of the vanilla.  I was in a rush so did not make the topping, what I used was just perfect.  Trader Joes sell a Sugar, Chocolate and Coffee Bean Grinder (I just adore this product) so I  grinded a large amount over each muffin before baking.  Totally perfect and loved by everyone.  I will make these always with these changes.

5 stars all the way!! I didn't have any brown sugar so I substituted with 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 and 1/2 tbl.molasses in the muffin batter. For the brown sugar in the topping I substituted with 1/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 tbl. molasses. I also only had medium sized eggs so I used 1 and 1/2. Definately a favorite and soooo moist!! The whole family liked it, even those who can't stand coffee. Thanks Leslie for sharing!!!

I gave it 4 stars because my daughters approved of the final product. It was good but did not have the coffee flavor I wanted. I used  using instant Medaglia d'Oro instant espresso powder, half of mini chocolate chips and topped it with Trader Joes sugar/chocolate/coffee bean grinder. Next time, I will double the coffee amount.

The batter smelt really yummy although I was disappointed with the final product....a bit heavy and not a lot of flavour (and I used 2 tablespoons of coffee).  I probably only had 1/4 cup chocolate shavings and chips, but I'm not sure...something is missing.

Yummy recipe! did half and half mini choc chips and regular choc chips. Should have put slightly less chocolate since I did this, because it was a little too much chocolate for me personally. Still a big hit. Will definitely be making this again and again.

These were good, but they were way to sweet for my taste(and that's saying alot). I cut the topping out, but the chocolate chips made them more like cupcakes. Rename them cappucino cupcakes and they'll be five stars.

These are delicious. I've made them a number of times and they are always a huge hit. I just upped the amount of instant coffee granules to a tablespoon, just because I love the taste, not because it was lacking in any way. Thank you for a great recipe!

I loved these muffins and I'm not a coffee drinker! I made the recipe exactly as written. The topping was a little difficult to work with... hands on seemed to be the best approach. While baking, the topping melted right into the top of the muffin. 
When I make these again, I may add more chocolate chips (since I'm a chocolate lover) and a tad more cinnamon. 
Delicious!!

So good!!! I made this into a quick bread and cooked it in a loaf pan at 350 degrees for 55 minutes.  It was a hit!  You only need half the amount of topping to make it this way.

I didn't try the topping, but I could see how it would perfect this recipe! I doubled the quantities & used 1tsp cappuccino dry mix and 1 tsp coffee granules. I didn't have the chocolate chips on hand, so I eliminated them- think that was a wise choice & I'm a chocolate fan. Everything else I did exact! Nice taste & smell.

I made these a couple years ago exactly as the recipe suggested, but never made them again. They were easy and tasty enough-- just nothing special. Basically a dressed up chocolate chip muffin, although the topping was a nice touch.

These muffins were delicious! I made them without the milk (as I am both lactose intolerant and a college student), and replaced the instant coffee and the milk with actually brewing a very dark cup of coffee. It turned out incredibly well. I also had to add a little more flour to thicken up the batter. Overall, amazing recipe.

Pretty good! They could have been a bit more moist. I added more instant coffee, cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the recipe, and left out the topping.

Followed the recipe with only one variation: i used 1/2 c. of liquid french vanilla creamer and 1/2 c. milk. Next time I will mix the chocolate chips in with the dry ingredients so they don't sink and i will cut the amount of chocolate chips in 1/2. Good starter recipe, with a few tweaks it will be perfect.

I loved these even though I HATE coffee. Next time I would double the recipe but not the topping because the recipe only made 18 large muffins (which were a BIG hit!!) and there was lots of topping left over. Also, I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg along with 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the muffins. I would recommend this recipe!!!! I'm sure you will LOVE them!!!

Awesome awesome awesome!! I used Irish Cream instant coffee granules (here comes the list of substitutions), 3/4 cups brown sugar, 1/4 cup organic cane sugar, cornstarch instead of the egg, water instead of the milk. BUT very good. If I had the eggs and milk I would have used them, but such a great idea to use the instant coffee!! I will absolutely make these again!

With the title "Cappuccino Muffins" I was expecting more of a coffee flavor. Following the reviews of others, I increased the coffee to 3 teaspoons, and dissolved it in the milk before adding, which I would recommend to others. To save calories, I opted for a dusting of brown sugar on top instead of the streusel. UPDATE: my husband liked them so much, he requested another batch. Made with whole wheat flour and applesauce - couldn't tell the difference. YUM.

Very Good! I made only a couple of alterations. I added already made coffee to the wet ingredients instead of using instant coffee in the dry. Also, I melted the chocolate chips and stirred it in at the end.

Moist, delightful muffin.  I think next time I will add a bit more instant coffee to give it a little more cappuccino flavor, and you could cut down on the butter a bit.  But it is great just the way it is, too.

These were a huge hit at a Sunday School brunch that I went to.  In fact, by the time I went to get one, they were all gone!  Luckily, I had saved a few at home.  The only change that I made was slightly increasing the amount of coffee that it called for as recommended by other reviewers.

Yummy muffins that can be even better with some minor modifications mentioned in other feedback.  First, definitely need at least 5 teaspoons of coffee granules; I also added some to the topping.  Secondly, using canola oil is a great idea instead of using butter. I used chocolate chunks in mine and the topping is not-to-be-missed.  Will make again and again!

Absolutely delicious! The taste and texture were perfect. I doubled the amount of instant coffee granules, using 4 teaspoons instead of 2. I did that because I live in a house full of coffee lovers. Great recipe. :)

These muffins are amazing! Everywhere I take them, they are a hit. Even those who don't like the taste of coffee love these muffins. The only thing I added was some large crystal sugar sprinkles for a perfect finish.

Really enjoyed them.  I increased the amount of coffee to 5 tsp and the vanilla to 2 tsp.  Other than that followed the recipe.  Plan on making them again and again.

I made these muffins and they were okay but not amazing. I would much rather have chocolate chip muffin than these. (and I love coffee!) Once they cooled off they became kind of hard. But the topping did make it better.

Very good recipe, subtle flavoring. I wanted a more robust flavoring, however, so I added another tablespoon of instant coffee, and another teaspoon of cinnamon. At the end, it was too liquid-y, so I added another cup of flour. I also liked the touch of the chocolate chips.  I topped the muffins with a cinnamon sugar mixture, and some brickled toffee bits. In the end, I had light muffins with a large crown with a bit of crunch on the top.  I find that this modification has a bit more pizazz, and isn't exactly for a kid's treat, but more of an 'end of the night wind-down from a long day' kind of treat - espescially if you add a few more chocolate chips, and a bit more instant coffee. ;)  Overall, spectacularly done.

These are scrumptious, moist, and delicious!  Exactly what a muffin should be. I made a single batch and they disappeared so fast I had to make a double batch the next day. This is now my family's favorite muffin. The only tweak to the recipe I made was to use olive oil instead of melted butter to cut calories a bit.  They still turned out great.

Very tasty. I have a square muffin pan which makes larger than standard but smaller than jumbo muffins so I got 11 from this recipe. Very quick and easy recipe to make. I used one tube of Starbucks Via micro-ground since it's the only instant coffee I had and regular semi-sweet chocolate chips not the mini.  I think it would be even better with the mini chips.  I will be making these again.

These were a huge hit with my family!  I actually left out the instant coffee grounds because I didn't have any on hand, but they still had a great flavor that goes great with milk or a morning cup of coffee.  Thank you for sharing!

I followed this recipe exactly except for the topping and chocolate chips. As another reviewer suggested, I subbed 2 tbsp cocoa powder for the chips and just did a powdered sugar dust on top. The batter looked a little dry to me before I spooned it into the cups so I added just a splash more milk. I baked them in silicone cups and had no problems.    The texture of the muffins was nice and tender but the flavor left a little to be desired. The coffee flavor is more of an aftertaste so I'm going to use another tsp of the instant granules next time. I love that the muffins aren't too sweet and are great for breakfast. If I were to eat them as a dessert I might incorporate some chocolate syrup into the mix and a slight drizzle on top.

These are delicious! I'm always happy to find novel recipes that I can find all of the ingredients for in Korea. I would have rated 5 stars but my first batch completely fell apart. And I don't mean figuratively. The crumbled pieces gave me an excuse to save some muffin for myself at home ;) but I had to switch to using cupcake liners. I greased my muffin tin real well so idk what happened.

OMG!!! Can these get any better??? Am not a fan of coffe drinks in general, but any coffee cake/ candy amazes me.. I love its aroma. However, next time i'll half the amount of chocochips, coz i don't want the taste of chocolate to overtake the taste of coffee. A definite definite keeper! wooooow!

They were good, but would be better if the coffee granules were dissolved in the milk before adding to the flour mixture.  They were very moist.  I may try buttermilk instead of milk next time, just for fun.

Yes, these are very tasty! They went over well at Bible study this morning! Next time I think I will try dry cappuccino mix instead of instant coffee like one reviewer mentioned- I think I would like the taste even better. I only needed to bake them for 21 minutes. Although I was impressed with the muffin, I wasn't overly impressed with the topping. These would be good with a different crumble topping or icing drizzle. Overall- great recipe!

These are very moist and delicious! I made them in hopes of having them for Christmas Eve...I don't think they will last that long. I didn't put the struesel on top only because I din't want to mess with it...they have so much going on inside that it really didn't need it. Great recipe and definitely going in my "keeper" file!

This was soooo easy, and the muffins were soooo good.  I made these for a faculty meeting at my children's school, now they are asking me to make more for next time.  The few I had left over didn't last the night.  Will make again soon.

Really delicious. I made these for a family reunion and got rave reviews. These freeze exceptionally well, stay moist and keep their shape. I used regular chocolate chips too and they are just as good. I will be making these again.
