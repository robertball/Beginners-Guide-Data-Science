Great dip recipe! I cut it in half and instead of shredded cheddar cheese I used Velveeta which gave it a smooth creamy taste. All you have to do is pop it in the microwave and stir it occasionally. I also tossed in a bit of grated Parmesan for a little flair. This stuff is oh so good. I served it with "Easy Beer Bread Mix" from this site - a definite keeper!

I love this recipe!!! I have made it on many occasions with a few alterations and people devour it! I am always asked for the recipe and people beg me to make it for parties. I usually add more beer and garlic and since this thins the consistency I'll throw in a handful of shredded Romano cheese to thicken it back up. Blue cheese is also a great add-in for a twist on the taste. IF you have any leftovers (if I don't use a bread bowl I can sometimes scrape some up) try adding a couple of spoonfuls to mashed potatoes for a new side dish. Absolutely delicious!

Although I'm sure this makes for a great appetizer this went great with our chili dinner!! I used a loaf of french bread (buttered and broiled for a few min to make "crusty" bread). Also I could tell this was going to make ALOT so I reduced the cream cheese to (1) 8oz pkg used 8oz velveeta instead of cheddar (keeping it creamy) and no garlic powder. If you melt in the microwave and stir every minute until heated through and melted it turns out great and clean-up is minimal (and you can dip RIGHT from the bowl). Also prevents burning or any other possible disasters. I still have a little leftover so I guess I'll have to get more bread!!

This was wonderful! I took this to a party and there were absolutely none leftover! I made a couple of changes to it though. I added quite a bit more garlic and some Italian seasoning and instead of just mixing it all together I melted it all together. Everyone loved it and I will definitly make this again.

This recipe was very easy. I just dumped all the ingredients in my food processor and "pulsed" until it was the right consistancy. I added quite a bit more garlic than what was called for and a dash of "Italian seasoning" - it turned out fantastic. I also used a "beer bread" recipe from Allrecipes submitted by Jodi Regan for my serving loaf--easy! I love it.

This is delicious!! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added green onion and italian seasonings. I LOVED the taste but didn't like the consistency. (Too stiff for a bread bowl and the cheddar cheese made it too lumpy. GREAT as a dip for pretzels though!!) So - again - I followed another reviewer's suggestion to melt the ingredients. PERFECT! I put it in a cheddar/garlic bread bowl and it got rave reviews. Thanks for sharing!

Very easy to make!! Didn't have enough kick so I added a generous amount of cayenne pepper along with some Texas Pete. Made it excellent!! To make a little creamier add extra beer after taking out of the fridge and before serving.

I've been making this for years but I add 1 pkg. ranch dressing mix and 3 chopped scallions/green onions. It's best if it stands overnight and is really good with big sourdough pretzels.

I really liked this recipe...but my husband said it was only good...hence the 4 star rating. I am an avid garlic lover but my husband said that there was just too much of a garlic taste. I tried a second time and took another reviewer's advice and used velvetta instead of cheddar...turned out much better. I will make again...but will have to reduce the garlic a bit. Thanks for posting.

I like this recipe as a base; however being a fan of The Melting Pot's cheese fondue I alter this dip to taste like the restaurant's version. To the cheese I add a tablespoon or two of Worcestshire sauce and a teaspoon of mustard powder. I then microwave the mixture until melted and pour it into a bread bowl before serving. Voila -- Melting Pot fondue taste in a fantastic dip that everyone loves at parties!

I followed the suggestions about using velveeta adding green onions and microwaving. Took to a party with onion bagel pieces. No one said anything but it was all gone and it wasn't that big of a party. I loved it.

This was a big hit at my 4th of July annual barbecue. Everyone asked for the recipe. I did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and I melted the ingredients in the microwave. I melted them on high power stirring after one minute until it reached the desired consistency. Be careful not to overcook!

I didn't want such a large amount so I cut in half and served in a bowl. I recommend using 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 pepper jack. The pepper jack adds a really nice bite without being too spicy. Lowfat cream cheese does not hurt the flavor at all. I would also double the amount of garlic powder called for. I added some chopped olives for a little color and it was a nice addition. Served with tortilla chips. I heard someone at our party say that it was "addicting" and the bowl was empty very quickly.

I love this recipe with Corona. I'm a sucker for both corona and cheese anyway so this recipe works for me. There is a beer cheese recipe that my family makes with the jarred "old english" cheese and when I made it it made me sick. This recipe did not make me sick and it tasted beautifully as is with no additions or changes. Just a side note this cheese is a lot better once it's been refrigerated for a few hours. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic and easy! Served this for New Year's Eve with crackers. Just put it into a bowl with a small knife and watched it disappear! I used dark beer with this recipe but I wouldn't hesitate to use light beer either.

I made this for my husband with guinness (his favorite). I scaled this down quite a bit but used enough beer to get it to the consistancy I wanted I didn't measure it. I also sprinkled some paprika on top for color. I'm giving this four stars based on what my husband thought of it (I didn't try any I'm pregnant and don't really care for beer anyways)... he said the first few bites were weird but it grew on him and he thought it was good. I don't know if its something he'd ask me to make again but he did eat it all in one sitting!

This has become one of my favorite appetizers and I always get rave reviews. The first time I made it it was too thick to use with bread so ever since I've started to serve in a bowl with pretzels on the side. That works really well.

I used Blue Moon and the flavor of the beer was overpowering to me. I added more cream cheese and some seasonings to mellow it out. It was a hit at the party and got better after it set for awhile. I think it would have been even better hot. I would use a lighter beer next time.

Great dip cold or hot. Just bake until gooey if you are in the mood for a warm dip. Either way it has gotten raves.

Try it warm! I was looking for something to serve with beer bread and thought Why not beer cheese? It turned out to be a wonderful fondue at the party! Try it with Carrots Granny Smith apples any veggie really! Everyone was dipping anything they could find in it because it was so good!

I did mine a little different.....omitted the cream cheese and did the rest of the ingredients in the microwave. I've also tried it using a double boiler (a little more work). Yummy. Tastes just like an appetizer from my favorite "fondue" restaurant.

Good base but really needed more seasoning. Be careful what type of beer you use also. Bitter beer wouldn't do well. I added more garlic powder plus some onion powder. It was not bad but I'll keep working on it.

great taste but next time i'll use whipped cream cheese to hopefully creative a smoother/softer texture. The pretzels and crackers kept breaking in it because it was so thick.

This was ok. Not the awesome 5 star recipe I was expecting. My wife and 3 children did not think it tasted good. Imagine cream cheese and cheddar blended with a touch of garlic and beer. Bottled jalapeño cheese is much better.

I brought this dip to a food day at work and it got rave reviews. Several people even asked for the recipe. I microwaved the dip as several other reviews suggested and it turned out great. Without microwaving it it was kind of lumpy but after it turned out nice and creamy. I served with beer bread but would be equally delicious on pita chips or crackers.

This is simple yet addicting. It's missing something though... maybe some italian seasoning? I'd cut the garlic back a bit too (and I love garlic). Served it with Tostitos Scoops and pretzels. Thanks!

I used velveeta instead of cheddar cheese because it blends better. Serve this Beer Cheese Dip with the Buttery Soft Pretzels from this site--but for the pretzel recipe instead of disolving the yeast in water use the same BEER (warm) that you used for the dip! The combination of flavors in the beer dip and the beer pretzels can't be beat!! I've never seen an appetizer vanish quicker!!

So good! I used a little extra beer and garlic and some Cajun seasoning. Had to rehydrate with more beer and reheat a few times over the course of the night but it was just as good after doing so. Will totally make again! UPDATE: This was also really good with Monterey Jack cheese instead of cheddar and onion powder and a little white pepper instead of garlic.

I have tried this recipe and found that if you add a package of dry ranch dressing mix to it and chopped green onions it becomes very flavorful. Let the dip sit overnight and the flavors really come out and makes it quite tasty!

Good dip - I take it to many parties. I would like to find a way to make it smoother though. The taste is great and I've passed this recipe on to friend's who have asked for the recipe. It's so easy - and tastes great!

Great recipe to go along with beer bread but I think the key is to melt in the microwave after combined I think I would hate it if it wasn t.

This recipe always gets rave reviews when I make it for parties. I do add more beer than the 1/2 cup and more garlic powder. Also I cook and crumble up bacon to add to it along with chopped green onion. I also serve it warm in a bread bowl with bread and pretzels to dip in it. It's the best beer cheese dip ever and extremely easy to make!

Honestly didn't like this at all. Threw it away after a party and realized it had been passed over. It was lumpy and nasty looking and smelling. The taste was far from appealing. I gave it two stars because I used a darker beer and that may have caused some issues but certainly not all. Sorry:(
