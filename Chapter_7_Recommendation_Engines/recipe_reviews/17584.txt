Wonderful!  I used fat free cream cheese, Splenda, fat free Cool hip and sugar free cherry pie filling.  By my calculations I cut the calories per slice in half (400 to 202 per).  It came out beautifully and tasted wonderful!

This is so tasty, and it's a very versatile recipe...but I did make some minor changes. I used powdered sugar- it incorporates into the filling better. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp of lemon extract and 1/2 tsp of orange extract to give the filling more flavor.

I have been looking for a recipe like this. I used to make the one with condensed milk and lemon juice. This one sets up nicely, tastes better, and is ready in a few minutes. I will be bringing it to potlucks from now on and serving it at family dinners. The best easy dessert I have made in a long time. My family loves it!

This is super simple and tastes great. You really can't mess this one up! I used blueberry pie filling. I reserved about a half a cup of the cream mix to pipe decorations on top of the berries.

This was an awesome and easy dessert!!  I showed this to my hubby and he's like, what?!?!?  no chocolate!!  So I promptly changed it to a oreo chocolate crust and added fresh stawberries and blueberries to the top.  I then drizzled chocolate fruit dipping sauce over the top.  It was divine!!  I love it the traditional way, but this variation will please anyone!!  Thanks for sharing, Snowpoet!

The best I've tried of its type. True, it's not exactly what you could call a cheesecake, so "Cheese Pie" is appropriate. This recipe sets up much more predictably than the one made with sweetened, condensed milk and lemon juice. The texture is light and creamy when served cold - tends to get a little loose as it comes closer to room temperature. As a consequence, it may be frozen, and when allowed to thaw for a few minutes, can be cut and served that way. To give the cheese layer a little more interest, I added about 1/4 tsp lemon extract, plus a dash each of maple and almond extracts. These complemented the cherries perfectly. A+ for a simple recipe that tastes luscious and takes only minutes to throw together.

So easy!  Very good!  Can be piped into mini pie or tart shells as well and topped with an almost endless variety of toppings (graham cracker crumbs, different pie fillings, chocolate shavings, caramel syrup, cupcake sprinkles, chopped nuts, candies, etc.)

I'm amazed that something so simple can taste so good. My mother thought it was custard & couldn't believe it was no-bake cheesecake. Instead of cherry topping, I used strawberry topping made with cornstarch, sugar, & strawberries. And I used a chocolate crumb crust.

I love this pie. It's quick, easy, and delicious, and there are endless variations (I've made cherry, strawberry, and chocolate so far). Everyone I've made it for loves it, you really can't go wrong with this one :)

What a wonderful and easy recipe.  I made three pies, cherry, blueberry & chocolate for family Christmas and they got rave reviews.  For the chocolate, I used chocolate cool whip and chocolate graham cracker crumb pie shells. Wonderful!!  This pie is a staple now!!

Excellent, easy, and a big hit.  So much better than the other cherry cheesecake pie and cherry cheese pie recipes that are all over this site..and often are the same recipe...Stick with this one!  I used cherries on some, blueberries on the some, and lemon pie filling on the rest..Also used the mini graham cracker crusts..so I had several individual servings....it made for a colorful, unique presentation.  A Thanksgiving Hit!!

thank you, thank you for this recipe. I made this way back in the 60's but made it w/ dream whip and cream cheese. My son LOVES anything cherry and I have wanted to make this again for him, but didn't think that they even made dream whip anymore. I have thinking of subing w/ cool whip, but just haven't tried it. This has given me courage! I'm sure it will be wonderful. Again thank you.

SOOO Easy!  I've done it with many different fruits and it is always tasty.  On Easter Sunday I discovered I didn't have enough sugar in the house so I substituted marshmallow cream.  It worked very well - still set up and cut like a dream.  I used twice what the sugar measurement was.  Might have been a little sweet but helped to completely fill the pie crust.  YUM.

I have been making this for years.  I add a teaspoon of lemon juice and a teaspoon of vanilla to the mixture.  

A really good variation is to add crushed up oreo cookies or crushed up chocolate chip cookies.  My father-in-law requests this every holiday.

I ran out of sugar, so I used a bit of granulated sugar and powdered sugar and it was great.  I also used a regular pie crust which I baked and that was a treat.

Great pie,  i've been making this for years with  little changes.. I use powdered ( confectioners) sugar instead of regular sugar and add a teas of almond extract.  I also use a pecan crust instead of graham cracker crust.  I always get raves.

I love this recipe!  It's the way my mom used to make it, instead of the sweetened condensed milk, and is so much easier and quicker to make.  Love it!  I used light cream cheese and light whipped topping and it tasted great.  Nice and fluffy light.  Yum!

This is one of my favorite dessert recipes ever! My mother used to make it; the only difference is she used Dream Whip instead of frozen whipped topping. It is a little lighter and I like the texture a bit better. Sometimes I make a double recipe and put cherries on half and blueberries on the other half!

You can really make this any variety of ways and make it both lighter and low carb. For low carbers, just make a Atkins nut crust and use Splenda instead of sugar and a sugar free or light cherry pie filling. For people watching their sugars/weight, it's just as good using reduced fat cream cheese, light or "free" whipped topping and light cherry pie filling. I've had it many ways and it's really good every single time.

yum.  I think next time I would like to add 1 more bar of cream cheese to the mix just to make it thicker.

This pie was awesome! I made my own graham cracker crust. I took it to a get together and people were fighting over the last piece! I am adding it to my holiday pie list!

My boys aren't crazy about cherries, so I substituted a chocolate graham cracker pie crust and folded crushed oreo cookies into the filling. It was SO easy and the kids loved it...a definate keeper!

Made this with my 13 year old daughter.  We used an oreo cookie crust for one of the pies and graham cracker for the other, it was wonderful.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  Easiest thing I ever made.

Delicious. Have made several times. The filling is always more than the pie crust can handle, though.

The pie was "ok". Nothing to write home about.  I would cut back on the cool whip some as it overpowered the cream cheese a bit.  Im wondering if it is made with real whipped cream if it would taste better?

My son made this for a boy scout dessert bar and it was a hit.  We used low-fat cream cheese and lite cool whip.  I thought it was a little too sweet, so I made it again and added a tablespoon or two of lime juice - much better!  Gave it just the right about of tang to balance the sweetness.  This will come out whenever we need a quick and easy dessert!

I make a similar Cheese Pie except you use dream whip instead of cool whip. I find it smoother. I use blueberry or cherry pie filling depending on what I'm craving.  This is my Husband's favorite dessert. He asks for it every birthday. If you like cheese cake but find it heavy try this recipe- you live it!

I made this exactly as written.  It was quick and easy and would be something that I would think you could take to a potluck.   Not much trouble at all.  However, as written, it seems to lack a bit of flavour to me.  I am not sure that the cherries on top really even had much flavour.  I think the basic recipe is good though, and I will make my own version of it one of these days using fresh whole ingredients (real whipping cream, fresh fruit, etc).  The basic idea of this recipe is good ~ very refreshing.

FANTASTIC!  Not only is it quick and easy, but it tastes so good!  I made only a few changes, I made my own graham cracker crust.  It's a simple way to make it a big more homemade.  I also added about a tsp of vanilla and almond extract to the cherries before putting them on the pie.  I highly recommend the almond extract, it adds a wonderful flavor and an extra layer of flavor. I also used the French Vanilla whipped topping.  Delicious, thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is so easy!  I used 1/3 fat cream cheese, light whipped topping, and mini graham cracker crusts for individual servings, topped with thawed frozen strawberries in light syrup.  We really enjoyed it, thanks!

This has a great sweet but not-too-sweet taste and very nice flavor.  It is gulped down at any party I take it to.  You can easily use low-fat products to ease up on the calories.

My aunt makes this every year at Thanksgiving, and it is the first thing gone. I thought she spent hours making it, and when she gave me the recipe I was shocked!  It is a family favorite, we call it "cherry delight". It is my all-time favorite dessert, so much creamier than cheesecake, and so easy!

This is the easiest and best tasting no-bake cheesecake recipe I have found.  My family loves cheesecakes, but I sometimes don't have time to make one, this one works great.  Not that no-bake is any comparison for a good cheesecake, but when you are running short on time, this is really good.

When asked to bring dessert to a Suppers 8 dinner at church, I came to Allrecipes for help as dessert is not really what I do best.  This Pie was so terrific, so easy, so successful, so tasty and so beautiful, it will probably become my trademark!

Have made this recipe for years.  The last time I made it I forgot to add the sugar and no one noticed.  I use 2 packages of cream cheese to 1 carton of CoolWhip.  I also add toasted, sliced almonds to the graham cracker crust before adding the CoolWhip/cream cheese mixture.  I usually use a can of cherries to which I have added almond extract.  Quick, easy and light.  A family favorite.

this came out so easy and tasty! I wanted to make it more low-sugar, so used 1/4 cup Splenda in place of regular sugar; also used Reddi Wip instead of the tub stuff, which only needed about half a can (just kind of eyeballed to the right consistency); then added some cinnamon, clove and ginger to my "no sugar added" cherry pie filling. came out just right consistency and very tasty,  my hubby even requested it again and again! Real simple easy winner!

This was wonderful. So easy to make, light and delicious, and  not too sweet. I would have given it 5 stars but I slightly altered the recipe by adding some almond extract to the cherries.

This is a light, fluffy cheesecake filling that is Delish!  I did substitute Splenda for the sugar in the recipe.  No one would notice that substitution if you didn't mention it.  This lovely pie would make a great Valentine's Day dessert...or Washington's Birthday!  Have fun in the kitchen and enjoy your dessert!

It's OK... It's not WONDERFUL but it's OK for a no bake. It's not bad. It's fast to make. If i ever need a recipe for a fast pie i'll probably make this again.

Followed some advice from other reviews before I made it, and used powdered sugar instead of granulated and only used 1 1/2 cups of cool whip and it turned out great and was easy to make.

This was pretty good. More like 3 1/2 stars really. I used a shortbread crust, used confectioners sugar and added a tsp vanilla. My kids loved it but I felt like I was eating cherry pie filling on top of whipped cream. I would make it again but I think I'll either increase the cream cheese or decrease the whipped cream.

I love this pie. It's so easy to make! I always have my little ones make it with me, because it's that easy! Something to throw together quickly & taste even better. Only thing in the recipe that I changed was that, I used powered sugar vs. regular sugar. It blends better. This is a family favorite in my household.

It didn't have enough of the "cheese-cake" type flavor that I expected. In fact it was just kind of sweet but boring.  I will try it again, but I'm going to cut the whipped topping and add a little extra cream cheese and see if that works to make this pie awesome.

Easy, inexpensive, little clean up time.
Changes to make in the future: homemade whipped cream instead of Cool Whip. Also cut 2 C to 1.5-1.75C. The texture and taste will be better. Blueberry pie topping and add lemon juice to filling. Also, homemade graham crust.

I make this DESSERT all the time !
It is great for a I'VE GOTTA BRING SOMETHING recipe. My family loves it too.
I use ready made pie crust. I usually use Graham Cracker but recently I tried a Short Bread crust... IT'S GOOD! 
I'm thinking of trying a different fruit,just to switch things up.
Make this YUMMY PIE DESSERT

My new assistant says she loves working for me partly because she never learned to cook and I teach her.  We each got two pounds of fresh cherries last week and I had her make two of these pies.  Of course, we always sample.  One bite and we exchanged a look that said, "Decadent nirvana!"  You should have seen her face when I handed her the second pie to take home for dessert.  This is a winner and so easy!  And she's making two more and wowing her family with her new-found "cooking" skills.  I only made one tiny change.  Our cherries were monster sour so I added some sweetener to those.  And remembered just in time, to check for seeds and stems!  Thank you for this elegant recipe!

SO easy and so good.  I've made this for years with confectioner's (powdered) sugar and a mixed berry topping (2 cups frozen mixed berries, 1/2 cup sugar and 2 Tbl cornstarch cooked about five min until thick and then cooled completely) but I love all the ideas and variations listed in the reviews.  The best part is you can always have the ingredients on hand. If you don't have two hours to cool it completely, an hour (or even a week lol) in the freeze works too.

I'm not usually a fan of "no bake" desserts but didn't want to put the oven on in July. I had saved this recipe a long time ago so after reading the good reviews, I decided to try it and I'm so glad I did!  Delicious and easy and my company loved it.  I made it exactly as the recipe reads.  I used  12 individual tarts  in place of the 9-inch pie and used cherry topping.  Very pretty and very scrumptious! Next time I may cut  back Cool Whip to 10 to 12 oz. not 16 as it does overpower cream cheese.  May try confectionary sugar, as suggested in other review, in place of regular sugar.   Will make again.....even in January!

I used homemade whipped cream, made with almond and vanilla extract, instead of the whipped topping. I ended up having about 1 cup of cheese filling that didn't fit into the pan, but it was so tasty that I have no doubt we'll eat it!  The lightness of this pie with the crunchiness of a homemade crust was the perfect dessert!  I will definitely make again and with different pie fillings.

Very nice and will make again.  Added 4oz of sour cream as others suggested. That really helped it taste like a true cheesecake.  Next time I may up the cream cheese to 12 oz.  Couldn't hurt because the taste is really good.  The pic looks like a regular crust not a graham cracker crust?

Yummmmmm!  I was a little worried at first b/c the white sugar make the filling pretty grainy, but after refrigerating a while, the sugar dissolved and it was awesome, and couldn't be easier.  But if you're gonna be serving this right away, you might want to use powdered sugar instead.

I've made this different ways, but it's never come out with a good texture...it's always a little too mushy. Maybe more cream cheese or less whipped topping would help. Also, makes a little more than can comfortably fit into a regular pie crust so use a big one.

Thank you for the recipe.  I used to make this a lot but when I moved three years ago, lost the recipe.  I knew it called for more than the cream cheese and whipped topping, but couldn't remember what.  It was the sugar.  Another great topping is strawberries mixed with glaze.  YUM!!

This is a five star recipe considering effort and amount of ingredients. Although I'm very satisfied with the result, it's a bit too creamy for me. Next time, I'll probably reduce the amount of whipping cream, whipped heavy cream, and add more cream cheese instead. Those of you who prefer  creamy texture, it's perfect.

Awesome!  Friends really liked it.  I used a chocolate oreo crust and then crushed one on top.  Agree that it is a cheese pie (not cheesecake). Great recipe.

This pie is so easy and so delicious! My husband loves the box mix no-bake cheesecake but I hate making stuff out of a box. I am so glad I found this recipe because it is so much better and just as easy to make.

So simple, yet very cool and creamy.  Just what I was looking for!  I didn't have cherry pie filling so I just put a dollop of strawberry jam on each piece, YUMMM!

Wonderful recipe!! I did not change anything except for using fat free cream cheese, fat free whipped cream, splenda, and lite cherry pie topping.  This is a great pie to make in the summer...no oven!! Tastes so delicious and light! It has now become a family favorite!! Great for any occasion.

Fluffier than I anticipated - thought it would set up a little more but it tasted great.  Thought the whole can of cherries would over power the filling but it was just right.  An easy family weeknight dessert.  (With requests for more for breakfast the next morning.)

This pie is great with strawberry topping as well as blueberry or cherry.  It is almost the same as a pie my grandmother used to make called "Dream pie".

A simple, tasty substitute for cheesecake. My husband said the only was to improve this recipe is to cut larger slices. Enough said.

i LOVE easy pies and this is one of them!  I made it exactly as directed. I would push my mother out of the way to get the last slice because it really is just that good.

What I like so much about this pie is that you can dress it up or down. As is, it's fine, if you're not looking for a super sweet pie you can cut the sugar in half. I sometimes just want something to appease my sweet tooth. I have made this pie with pineapple filling on top which I think I like better than the cherries. This is a fun recipe to play with.
