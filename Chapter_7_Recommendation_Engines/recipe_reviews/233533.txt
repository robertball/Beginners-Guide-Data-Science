This made A LOT! I was shocked. It was my first time making tabbouleh and I wasn't sure what to expect. It is a lovely fresh tasting salad. A couple of holes in the recipe though that I had to fill in. Like the cucumbers. I wasn't sure what kind I was supposed to use. I ended up with an extra large garden cucumber and peeled and seeded it. Not sure if I was supposed to or not. Same with the tomato. There seemed to be an awful lot of juice coming out with the seeds included so I used one with seeds and one without. When it says 2 bunches, I guess it would be a different outcome if you had small bunches as opposed to large. I had really huge bunches so I only used one. I wished the measurement was in cups because I am such a tabbouleh newbie. Regardless, hubby and I enjoyed it and was happy to use all of my CSA veggies. We did a cheers to Maurice with dinner. Thanks for sharing your dad's recipe Charlie. I will make it again. My pic will be included in Sept 2013 Faceless Frenzy. :)

Good! Would recommend using less salt and then increasing the amount per your taste. The two bunches of green onions called for also seems a little excessive to me--I'd start with 1/2 cup (finely chopped) and then add more if you like onions. :)

I have tried several taboullah recipes and this one has inspired me more than the others. I say that because nearly every recipe I have tried includes the same basic ingredients. I think it is a matter of getting the right balance to suit the individual taste. The key for me was the inclusion of garlic and not too much olive oil. Also getting the right amount of parsley and mint is key. I did not have the green onions but I am sure they would be excellent. So I would encourage anyone to try this recipe and find the right balance between ingredients. I think I have found what I am looking for.

Wonderful! I am not an onion person, so I left out the green onions, and it was just to my liking. Used lime juice since I didnâ€™t have lemons, and it was still really good.

very tasty!  I didn't use fresh parsley because it was pretty bad looking at the market.  It was still very good.

I break some of the "rules" when it comes to food, so i will say that i also used it as the "rice" component for my curried chicken.  :)  It was excellent.  Nothing better than fusing middle eastern cuisine with caribbean.  :)

Loved it. Used only one bunch of green onions, and only one Valdalia onion, that was all I had! Still tasted delicious. Lots and Lots of fresh veggies.
