This recipe was OK.  I guess I was expecting something similar to the "Treasure Ship" restaraunt's recipe (Panama City, FL) and was greatly disappointed.   It was too runny to be considered a dip.  If you make this recipe, consider cutting back on the amount of Italian dressing that is in the recipe.

This was good.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and cut back on the italian dressing (about half).  I also added some grated parmesan cheese (spaghetti cheese) which helped to thicken the dip.  It also added some cheesy flavor!!!

I was very surprised how much I liked this recipe.  I am not a big fan of Tuna but it's great.

This was very good. It was'nt something I kept going back to for more and more which might be good for some.Since I did'nt have any tuna I added chopped spam instead.Very satifying.

This is a great recipie, but I found it to be watery. I added a 13 cup flour and extra can of tuna and this was wonderful and just the right texture.

This dip is much more sophisticated than you'd think and was a great hit at my gathering.

this dip is just okay. i think to say nobody could guess there is tuna in it is a bit false. you can definitely taste the tuna. not a dip i would make often unless someone requested a tuna dip.

Very disappointing.  I found it quite bland and unappetizing.

Smokey flavor was overpowering.  Very liquidy.  Could not serve to
guests or to family.  Expensive mistake.

I'm looking for a CRABBY TOMS copy cat recipe but this wasn't it. Too much cream cheese and needs more smokey flavor.

I did not care for this recipe. This was more like soup.  It was way too smoky.

Used good italian dressing... seems a bit over flavored with the dressing. Made it with smoked fresh halibut. The halibut had good texture and was moist.
