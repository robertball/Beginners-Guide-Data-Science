I didn't have grape jelly, so I used some blackberry-blueberry sauce and it was fantastic!  Hubby and I both love the fruity hint it gave the meat.  Sssooooooo easy and good enough to impress friends or company.

I subbed wild berry jam for the grape- didn't have any. Sliced it thinly once cooked, then threw it back into the slow cooker to absorb the juices & keep warm.  A little sweet for my taste but the family devoured it with grunts of pleasure so 5 stars it is!
