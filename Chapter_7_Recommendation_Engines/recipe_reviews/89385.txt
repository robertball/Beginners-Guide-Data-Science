Wow... I was actually nervous to try this But I had so many seeds this year that I figured "Why Not?" My whole family LOVED this recipe! My only complaint was not knowing how much salt or cinnamon to use... I had about 2 cups of seeds and I put them on a cookie sheet w/ foil. I didn't use any cooking spray. I sprinkled the enitre amount of seeds with cinnamon and I  tried to cover most of the seeds. I was scared about the salt so I sprinkled about a tbs. of sugar over the seeds and than I lightly sprinkled the seeds w/ the salt (probably about a tsp of salt), than I cooked it for 10 mins, took it out.. stirred it around in the cookie sheet and put another heavy coating of cinnamon and this time added more salt than I did last time (probably more like a tbs) and I put it back in the oven for 20 more mins. I was surprised at how well the salt and cinnamon tasted w/ the seeds. I'm definatly making these from now on! Thanks Alison!

When I submitted this recipe I said I sprinkled the salt and cinnamon on librally and amounts were not given so FYI I usually sprinkle a healthy dose of cinnamon and sea salt all over the seeds.  Hope this helps clarify a tad.  If you don't get too much cinnamon add more if you put too much...add less it is all to taste.  A smidge of sugar is also a nice addition.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was a great idea to build upon to your own tastes.  I personally was not crazy about the original recipe.  I took into account what some other review had said about adding extra cinnamon, so I had done that.  I wanted to add sugar, but was concerned about them sticking together as on review said, so I sprinkled about 1/2 cup of sugar on them immediately after coming out of the oven and stirred quickly until cooled.  Perfect!  Sweet and cinnamon seeds.  I also wouldn't do without the salt, but the original flavor was not for me.

I like pumpkin seeds, but I don't like the worsteshire (or however you spell it) sauce.  I was looking around and found this one!  I was afraid that the simplicity of the recipe was going to make it not very good, along with the distinct flavor of cinnamon.  ...but when we tried it, MAN it was good!  The cinnamon is not too overpowering and the salt is a good balance for the flavor.  They are PERFECT!  ...at least for me.

I'd recommend them to anyone wanting to do something with pumpkin seeds.

This was different but tasty.  I boiled the seeds for 5 minutes, strained them, then added the salt and cinnamon.  There's no need for cooking spray as long as you use aluminum foil and stir every 5 or some minutes.

MMMMM.... Munching on these as I type, and boy, are they good!  Had a small pumpkin, so only about a cup and a half of seeds, so I just followed the 2 to 1 salt/cinnamon ratio.  I drizzled a touch of oil directly onto mostly dry seeds, then tossed with salt, cinnamon, and just a tiny sprinkle of Splenda.  Roasted per recipe, stirring every 5 minutes, and added the salt and cinnamon again after the first stir (no more Splenda).  These are fantastic.  Not sure if I would have liked them without the tiny touch of sweet, and will try both ways when I have more seeds.  As it is, definitely a keeper.  I had no problems with the seeds sticking to the foil during baking.

These were pretty good.  They were really easy to make compared to the other recipes for pumpkin seeds that I had looked up.  My children and husband had never tried these before and they really liked them.  I'm sure that I will be making them again.  I think I will change up the spices for a little more flare.  I am from Maryland and some Old Bay sounds really good with this.

This was my very first time trying to make pumpkin seeds so I followed this to the letter except adding a little more cinnamon which the writer said was okay.  I gave this one star because that was the lowest they offered.  I followed everything to this recipe and they came out completely burnt and inedible.  They were gross.  Afterward I went back to other recipes and they said to only cook them for like 10 mintues max.  My daughter was really upset because she was so excited.    Whoever should decide to make this recipe I would cut the time down considerably or just plain skip it.

perfect. i'm currently on a limited diet, but wanted a sweet munch.  i used a little olive oil and agave nectar, lots of cinnamon and little less than the recommended salt.  about a cup of raw pumpkin seeds and roasted for about 30 min. the cinnamon is a wonderful compliment to the pumpkin seeds and smelled amazing in the oven! i may end up doing some more tweaking, but thank you so much for the idea.

These seeds turned out great. I did boil the seeds for about 6 minutes, then drained them, they seemed not to be so chewy. Love the cinnamon and salt flavor.

I've never eaten pumpkin seeds, let alone cooked them, so I was pretty excited at how simple this recipe. It really is up to the individual how much cinnamon and salt you use. I sprinkled cinnamon quite liberally, and used sea salt. Cooked them for 20 mins, stirring twice. A healthy snack!

Instead of vegetable oil cooking spray, I mixed with 1 1/2 tablespoon of melted margarine.  I baked it for one hour with turning over the seeds from time to time.  Yummy!

I had two cups pumpkin seeds so I half the salt and left the same amount of cinnamon for the flavor.  I don't know if thats what happen.  But ended up tasting like burnt popcorn. Very disappointed.

Delicious and addicting. The cinnamon enhances the toasty flavor.  Try it with some cayenne too!

These were very good!  I kept thinking I should sprinkle a little sugar on them, but after a couple handfuls I got to liking the salty/cinnamon combination.  Kind of reminds me that I always go for the sweet stuff, but I need to "retrain" my taste buds!

This was the first time I have ever toasted pumpkin seeds...this was a nice, easy and very tasty way to do it.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will probably go heavier on all the seasonings (including sugar) next time. Thanks!

Great combination of salt & cinnamon!  I thought there should be equal amounts of salt and cinnamon.  Really yummy!

I tried it with Butternut squash seeds and they spent no more than 20 total minutes in the oven since they're smaller. Also, I didn't have enough seeds so I just tried twice as much salt as cinnamon, and added a pinch of pumpkin spice.  I didn't end up using all of the spice, so I tossed the rest of at the very end.  Delicious, not very sweet and easy to eat.  I recommend the salt-cinnamon mix mixed into melted butter as well and tossed over popcorn (I've done that since I was little, so I was glad I found I could utilize the seeds similarly.  .

I love this!  I was a bit hesitant about the cinnamon and salt combo but after reading the reviews I was convinced to try it.  I took someones advice and doubled the cinnamon and salt and sprinkled a small amount of sugar over the seeds.

My friend & I teach together in a preschool classroom. I showed her this recipe & we decided to try this but we used Cinnamon/Sugar & Salt.  What a hit! Out of 30 children 28 of them gobbled it right up & asked for more! Now the parents are requesting this recipe!

We liked this recipe a lot. Our pumpkin gave us probably 2 cups of seeds but we still used the original measurements for the salt (1 tsp) and cinnamon (1/2 tsp). I didn't wash my seeds (I don't see the point, and as long as they're freshly out of the pumpkin and still damp, seasonings will stick to the seeds without using oil). I just dumped them all onto a cookie tray, sprinkled the salt and cinnamon over them, and then mixed it all up until the seeds looked fairly evenly coated. Then I spread the seeds out and roasted as per the directions. They did stick a little bit to the tray, but were very easy to scrape off.

It would never have occurred to me to try using cinnamon without sugar until I came across this recipe, but we really liked the flavor; salty-spiced without being overly sweet. I'd definitely make them this way again.

My son was very excited to try these after carving our Halloween pumpkins, but I have to admit to being a little disappointed in the flavor.  The cinnamon didn't stand out as much as I'd hoped. Maybe a little more salt - or maybe even some sugar - would have helped?

Based on other reviews here is what I did to modify the recipe because I do not like to mess around with things while they're in the oven/baking process.  I used enough Olive Oil in a bowl just enough to coat the seeds.  For this batch I worked with 2 cups.  To that I added 1/2 tsp of salt, 2 tbsp of sugar and 2 tsp of cinnamon.  Turn/flip seeds occasionally through the baking process.  Depending on how wet the seeds are will determine how long they need to bake, each oven will change the baking time too.  And, how done you like your seeds will determine how long you need to bake them.  I personally do not like crunchy/burnt seeds.  I think coating your seeds ahead of time with the sugar / cinnamon will make things a lot easier.  Decided to cook this at a cooler temp - lowered down to 300 - so as not to burn the seeds - took a little longer but no one here likes the seeds burnt/crispy.  Flavor was mild and no hint of the salt so if you're looking for that increase the salt, but otherwise turned out great.  Thanks for posting the recipe.  Definitely one that the kids will love!

Good potential but as instructed in this recipe it's not very flavorful at all.  The cinnamon flavor was very subtle.  I would have liked a stronger cinn flavor.  Next time I will double the cinn and maybe add nutmeg and cloves too (or a pumpkin spice).  Not terrible though.

I have never had pumpkin seeds before so I figured I'd give it a whirl this year.  So the kids and I made these.  I personally thought they were just okay and probably won't eat them (I just think I'm not a pumpkin seed fan is all) but my kids LOVED them!!!  I gave this recipe 4 stars!!  Thanks!!

I have such fond memories of roasted pumpkin seeds from years of jack-o-lantern carving.  This recipe was a nice twist on an old favorite.  I didn't measure the amounts of salt, cinnamon, or sugar (added when removed form the oven), but I did sprinkle all liberally, and I did apply a second coating after 5 minutes as suggested.  They turned out great!  Now I have two favorite ways to roast pumpkin seeds:  the traditional way with just salt, and this new way with cinnamon, salt and sugar.

I had never roasted pumpkin seeds before. Not knowing what to expect, these had a nutty taste to them which was good. I just wish they weren't so 'slivery' (like eating the shell of a sunflower seed.) Maybe if they were soft we'd have liked them more because the flavor was good. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought it was a wonderful idea adding the cinnamon, gave the seeds a special smething extra! I added a scant amount of sugar as well which was lovely.

These were a great change from the norm. I pretty much guessed at the cinnamon and salt combo and I added some pumpkin pie spice to it as well. Later into the cooking I added some sugar, which of course made the seeds stick to the cookie sheet. They taste great!

I'm not sure if it's just personal taste or if I did something wrong, but  I really did not care for the combination of cinnamon & salt at all.  I ended up adding some sugar to the seeds in a bowl, and spraying them with an oil-sprayer while stirring frantically in an attempt to get the sugar to stick and change the flavor.  To me, it was just an awful combo of bitter + salty, rather than the divine spicy + salty flavor other reviewers raved about.  My husband felt the same way.  My kids seemed to really like them, though...maybe b/c they helped make them.

Not bad. I didn't use the oil, just some tin foil, they did stick a little but wasn't hard to scrape off. I also soaked the seeds in water over night before baking. The only cinnamon I had was cinnamon and sugar combined but was good anyway. Next time I will use more!
I did put a lot of salt 'cause my husbands a salt freak. 
They came outta the oven 5 minutes ago and they're gone already!

Maybe my husband and I put the wrong proportions of salt and cinnamon on the seeds but it just did not taste good.  We added extra salt and cinnamon to the recipe, cooked it for the allotted amount of time and they just tasted burnt with no flavor.  Sugar didn't even help it.  Sorry...just not good!!

This is a wonderful treat!  I really liked the two flavors together.  I think I'll add some sugar next time to try it out.

Not so good, sorry.  Next year I'll just stick with the normal salted version.   I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

Not bad. I tried adding sugar, and they are pretty good, but it made them stick together as the sugar carmelized. I think I prefer the savory or plain recipes better, maybe I will try with no suger next time.

I was disappointed with the taste of these seeds. The cinnamon flavor didn't stand out as much as I would have liked. I also had thought about adding sugar as well, that is if I make this recipe again.

These seeds tasted good, i just didn't think they tasted that different from regular pumpkin seeds. i didn't have four cups of seeds, but still used the amount of cinnamon and salt the original recipe called for, but really couldn't taste the cinnamon that much. one thing i did do was spray the seeds with a little butter flavor cooking spray to try to get as much of the seasoning to stick as possible.

Super easy but my seeds were small and so half of them burned before 10 minutes had passed. Nonetheless the un-burned ones were pretty tasty.
