This is the only chili recipe I will make now.  I do make some changes which I think makes it even better.  Instead of using 4 cans of stewed tomatoes, I use 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/ green chilis.  This makes the chili spicy.  If you don't like much spice, but want some spice, try 3 cans of stewed tomatoes and 1 can of the diced tomatoes w/green chilis. I think it's Del Monte that makes the diced tomatoes w/green chilis.  I also add more beans and more chili powder.  I keep twirking the recipe until I get what I like.  I'm going to be making this for a chili cook-off really soon, so I'm hoping everyone likes it as much as my family does!

Our family loved this recipe...even the kids.  Rather than plain chili powder, I used The Spice Hunter brand's "Chili Powder Blend" which has cocoa powder, cumin, cinnamon and cloves, among other things.  I really think that added a great flavor. I also used S&W brand Mexican seasoned stewed tomatoes.  Delicious! One more thing,...I added my kidney beans in with the tomatoes rather than waiting an hour and it turned out fine.

Super easy to make and turned out great!  I used a crock pot on low for about 4 hours.

This is a good starter. I did tweak & I added 2 can's of Bush's Chili beans & 1 can of Ranch style beans, instead of 4 cans of stewed tomatoes, I used 2 cans & added 1 can of Ro-tel (mild) We like our chili thick & not soupy.

*I've made this Chili again tonight and I have to say it's a favorite because it makes for easy, tasty, creative changes.
Hot Green Chili Powder (Hatch Chili's) as a substitute for Chili Powder.  Additonal toss in options, corn meal to thicken, cocoa for flavor and richness, black beans, white beans, chili beans in place of or in addition to red kidney beans adds more color and flavor.
I've used fresh onion, dried onion and no onion.  Oh, and instead of using ground beef I've opted to use a steak which I chopped into tiny cubes. 

I haven't found one to top this and I'm not going to start looking any time soon.

I was so surprised, I almost didn't make it because it seemed too easy.  My old recipe has tons of ingredients and it's very time consuming.  This was fast and my family liked it!  I did use 3 cans of stewed tomatoes (which I diced up) and 1 can of the Rotel hot diced tomatoes.  Used a little extra chili powder.  And, I used a can of the hot chili beans.  Just the right spice for us.

I didn't want to try a new chili recipe but my husband was insistent on trying something different. So he made this, and it was awesome. The only thing we did different is used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of two of the stewed tomatoes.

This is a good recipe, it just needs one thing--MORE BEANS!! I half the recipe for my family, except put a whole can of kidney beans and a can of red beans. It is a very basic chili recipe.

This was a hit at my Superbowl party!! I changed 2 cans of the stewed tomatoes to diced tomatoes. 1 with jalepenos and 1 with chiles. This gave a little kick. I also added another can of the red beans because of other reviews. (I think next time I will try draining though)I used about a tablespoon more of chile powder too. Awesome!!

I made this recipe exactly as written (it gets annoying when people rate recipes and don't make it exactly as it's written).  Anyway, it turned out great!  It was great tasting, but a little soupy.  Next time I will:  add more beans and some Velveeta cheese.  I also chopped the stewed tomatoes, but they were still a little large, so I will chop them smaller next time.  Overall, a good recipe, and I will definitely make it again!

This was good!  I planned on making it exactly as written but of course I didn't have everything I needed so I substituted a tiny bit so I didn't have to make a grocery run!  I used a 28 oz & 15 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of 58 oz stewed and I used one can of black beans (drained).  I knew I would use more chili powder based on the reviews so I used 1 tablespoon in the beef when browning (I saw this idea in one of the reviews!) and then I used 3 tablespoons in the chili.   I will definately make again.

Excellent recipe! I used turkey (not a fan of beef) and it turned out great! I used lots of spices, we like things spicy. Great texture and thick. I also threw in a small zucchini, cubed. I love how they absorb the flavors of everything around them. I would recommend this to all chili lovers :)

We are snowed in today thanks to the blizzard of 2011, so I decided to make chili.  I couldn't run to the store so I needed to find a recipe with ingredients I had on hand.  This recipe fit the bill.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used diced tomatoes and added chopped celery, green pepper, and a couple teaspoons of sugar.  You can make this as hot as you like by adding jalapeño peppers, ground cayenne pepper, or crushed chili flakes.  This chili has been simmering in my slow cooker for a fews hours and smells awesome, I can already tell it's going to be delicious.  This was a quick and easy chili with just a handful of ingredients.  I truly believe that simpler is better.

Really good basic chili, though I did mix it up a bit. Instead of the 4 cans of stewed tomatoes, I used 2 cans of petite decided (plain) and 2 cans of petite decided with jalapenos. I'm a mild to moderate heat kind of girl, so adding these brought the right amount of heat. I also added another can of beans. I skipped the oregano (couldn't find it in my pantry), and added 1 tsp each of cumin (a must add for chili!), cinnamon and nutmeg. Garnish with sour cream and shredded cheddar blend, plus corn bread or tortilla chips on the side - perfecto!

I  am going to start this review by saying I have never made chili before in my life. I followed the directions exactly with the exception of replacing one can of the stewed tomatoes with one can of Rotel  canned tomatoes and green chilies. I also added an extra can of kidney beans, drained. Topped it with shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream and served it with corn muffins, Delicious!

I was really reluctant to try this very simple recipe. I am so happy with the results! This was very hearty and delicious! I did sub 2 cans of Rotel diced tomatoes with chili peppers for 2 of the stewed tomato cans because I had them in my pantry. I also added another can of kidney beans because we like beans :-) I don't need to search for the perfect chili recipe because I have found it!

I added 1 tbsp cumin, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and pepper to mine. Paired it with corn bread, freshly diced red onion and cheese and it was to die for. Will definately make again.

Very good basic chili base and extremely easy to make. I made mine with wild boar, which absorbed the liquid a bit better than beef.  I also added red beans, tobasco and instead of tomato sauce, some spicy salsa.  Just the right kick and very flavorful.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Excellent!  I doubled this recipe for a party and everyone licked the pot clean!  I made a few modifications, I added one can of tomato paste, rinsed the beans and doubled the recommended amount and added 2 bay leaves.  Everyone was raving about this recipe, thank you for posting it!!

We loved this recipe, I followed it to the "T" the first time I made it.  The 2nd time I added another can of beans.  This is a hearty, robust chili and very filling.  Add corn meal muffins and you have a great meal.

Really great basic recipe to tweak to your personal tastes.  We like more beans, less tomato, less oregano, add cumin, nutmeg, curry, a bit of sugar and oh yes - add jalapenos!  You really can't go wrong starting here.  Thanks Michelle!

I used this recipe as guideline and made some changes along the way.  I use 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of Jimmy Dean's hot sausage which gives it a nice flavor.  I also used 2 cans of Bush's Chili Starter, 1 green bell pepper, 1 medium yellow onion and 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  We put this in the slow cooker for about 5 hours and topped it with shredded cheese, sour cream and Fritos.  We don't make it too spicy to begin with, generally just let people add some hot sauce or red pepper flakes to increase the heat themselves.

This was great chili.  Made it for a Halloween Party and got rave reviews from everyone.  The only changes I made was using the Lawry's Chili Seasoning packet instead of the seasonings listed and I used Bush's Chili Beans.  I had to multiply by 4 to get enough for my crowd but will be making it again.  Thanks.

I halved the recipe, used ground turkey instead of beef, omitted the tomato sauce (because I didn't have it), used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, and threw in two cans of kidney beans instead of half a can (for a half-recipe).  It was great, and not soupy at all.  I'd probably use the tomato sauce next time to add a little more body, but it worked out just fine the way I did it this time.

im rating this more for the seasonings more than the recipe.  i increased the servings to 16 because i wanted to make this last a couple days and freeze a container too. i used 2 tall cans of chili beans, 3 stewed tomatoes, and 2 tomato sauce. i only had about 1 and 1/2 lbs of ground beef and it seemed plenty meaty for us. after i tasted it i did add 2 tsp of brown sugar to cut the acidity. my husband used rooster sauce to make his a little hotter and my 6 year old who hates chili saying its too spicy had a whole bowl last night and a burrito with it tonight. pleased with this.

Very good! I haven't reviewed anything before if that tells you anything. I used Benita diced tomatoes with green chilis, dashes of this and that (cocoa, garlic powder, onion salt), 2 cans chili beans and since I was out of tomato sauce, Campbells Tomato Soup! Still worked great as a smooth base for the chili and since our family likes chili with sour cream and sharp cheddar, still plenty of taste.

This is a great and easy recipe for Chili.  We like spicy Chili so I added a can of original and hot Rotel, more chili powder and red pepper flakes, omitted salt and added 2 cans of pinto beans instead of kidney beans.    Kidney beans always seem to be too strong of taste for our taste.  Very quick as well!!

This is a good starter recipe. I give it 4 stars because I had to add an extra can of beans and 3T of chili powder instead of 2 cuz it was bland with just 2. I also added a little black powder and a little cayenne to spice it up a bit. I rate my version 4.5-4.9

I enjoyed this.  I used the same ingredients, but different proportions.  I used 1 pound ground beef, about 1/4 of a medium onion, 3 cloves garlic, 1 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp oregano, the equivalent of 1.5 cans of tomato (I used home-canned tomatoes), 8 oz tomato sauce and 2 cans kidney beans (I added with the tomatoes)    I like more beans than beef, so that is preference.  I think I may try with (1 can) Mexican style tomatoes for a little kick next time, but the basic recipe is good and can obviously be tweaked to one's liking.  (The way I made it, it almost filled a 3-quart saucepan.)

Wow!  This recipe is soooooo easy and it is still delicious!  Unfortunately I had to omit the onions (boyfriend would refuse to eat it otherwise), but fortunately that saved me chopping time as well.  Didn't even notice them missing.  I also used garlic from a jar (ok, I added more than called for to make up for the omitted onions.)  Dinner was "prepared" in no time and simmering!  I did listen to other reviewers and used diced tomatoes instead of stewed and added two cans of kidney beans.  The chili was a bit "soupy" so I did drain my beans before adding and had to simmer it uncovered a bit longer than called for.  I also used the required amount of chili powder but it didn't have a kick.  However, this could be because my chili powder in the cupboard lost its punch.  Given the easy preparation and final flavor (I think the oregano is the secret to this simple recipe), I give it 4 stars.  THANK YOU for sharing.

I used Michelle's recipe for our Boy Scout Klondike outing. I made enough for 30 mouths and they all wanted more. Even the kids who don't like chili wanted more. I made no changes. I am a chili nut and loved the simplicity of this highly versitile recipe. Great job Michelle.

This is a great basic chili. My husband and I loved it. We live in Japan, so getting chili at a restaurant is difficult. I finally found red pinto beans in our local grocery store. At first I thought we made too much, but we ended up eating it for 3 days. Not to spicy. I am not a big fan of spicy. I will make this again!

This was good basic chili. It had the right amount of heat but wasn't spicy at all. I cut this in half, added in a can of beef consomme with the meat since it was still partially frozen, and I used a box of mexican tomato sauce. I would tweak this next time by adding a pinch of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes, Ranch style beans instead of kidney, and a hefty pinch of comino and 1/2 tsp or so of cocoa. Maybe even a splash of white vinegar to add some tang to it. (That was the secret to my Daddy's chili). Thanks, we had a great meal using your chili recipe.

This is almost exactly how I make my chili, and without even trying it, I know you'll love this recipe. The only variation I might make is if I have chili beans in the cupboard for a little kick.

This chili is fantastic! I first made it according to the exact recipe and now I use the recipe as a base and use what I have on hand. I often add a can of black beans, a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, a few T's of cocoa (YES!), and a little extra chili powder. I have tried many recipes, some very time consuming with lots of indredients, but this is the one that we all love!

It was great! Quick and easy and delicious! I think next time I'll put one less garlic clove or maybe a smaller one, other than that amazing! The man of the house loved it, so it's a definite keeper! It also works well if you don't have ketchup for a topping, but salsa.

Great basic recipe.  I added 1/4 cup marsala wine, cut the salt by l/2, ditched the oregano, used only diced, stewed tomatoes, 1 fresh, diced tomato and 1 can tomato paste.  Added cinnamon, nutmeg and cumin, as suggested by one reviewer.  Fabulous and the color is gorgeous!

This was not chili, this was spagetti sauce!! I couldve easily made up noodles and poured this over and if i called it chili I wouldve had noses turn up. I had to add half a bottle of Franks hot sauce just to give this a "chili" kick. I wont be keeping this recipe.

Wow man this stuff was surprisingly DELICIOUS.  Even my 7 yr old ate it.  I was hesitant about the organo because I am not a big oregano fan.  However, we couldn't even really taste it.  This chili was very tangy---perhaps because of the large amount of onion in it?  The only change I made was to use ground turkery.  Absolutely will make again.

I used two cans of stewed tomatoes and two cans of Ro-tel diced with green chiles.  I also drained the stewed tomatoes, doubled the beans and drained those as well. I also used 2lbs of ground beef and 1lb of ground pork for flavor.  It made a lot.  I think next time I will drain all of the tomatoes, I prefer my chili just a bit thicker, or possibly throw in some tomato paste for thickness.    This recipe had the right amount of heat without being too spicy.  My friend ate three bowls of the stuff, so I think it was a hit :).  Thanks!

This was well liked at the office. I added a lot more chili powder, an extra can of kidney beans and used diced tomatoes instead of stewed.

Delicious! Not only is this easy to make, but you can change or add a few things to fit your taste. I change a few things by using one onion, McCormick's chili mix instead of the chili powder, 2 cans stewed tomatoes, 2 cans Del Monte diced tomatoes "Zesty Chili Style", 1 can tomato paste for thickening, 1 can dark red kidney beans, and 1 can Bush's Chili Beans. I'm going to keep playing around with this though until I get it perfect!

This is also really good to make in the slow cooker, just put all the ingredients together and you have supper when you get home from work.

My husband and I halved it, but did two cans of beans, a 4 oz can of green chilies, some frozen okra, and instead of stewed tomatoes we used diced tomatoes. So good!

Yum. This is pretty good, but I added beans and red pepper flakes like JAN 8 reviewer. Trying to be cheap and healthy: left out the burger and served it on potatoes.

This is fantastic! I am never sure how things turn out (I am veggie, so I can't exactly taste test), so I was a bit hesitant to try something new. That said, this was the biggest hit for dinner last night! Only modification was that I used "chili beans" instead of regular ones and added some green pepper (diced) with the onion and meat. Will def be making this again, they practically licked their bowls!

Best chili I ever tasted! I used home-grown, frozen tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes, and didn't have any tomato sauce so I omitted it. It's still delicious.

This is super easy to make, and my family loves it. One time, instead of the kidney beans, I used a few big ladle-fulls of a 5 bean mixture my husband had been originally preparing (shelling, soaking, etc.) for a bean soup. It was a nice variation on the original to have all those different textures going on.

I won 2nd place at the church chili cook-off with this recipe the first time I made it! I used 3 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilis and 1 can of tomato sauce and about half the recommended amount of spices (since the tomatoes were already seasoned). Otherwise followed the recipe as stated. Moderately spicy, very tasty!

One of the best chili recipes I have found in a long time...Didn't have garlic cloves, so just used garlic powder. I also halved recipe, as I am the only person in my house who will eat chili! Turned out delicious..

I used to work at Lonestar Steakhouse, where they served Chili. I have been dying to have chili again and this recipe was the real deal. I did add cumin, brown sugar and an extra can of beans. Forget the other recipes, this is the best, tasted exactly like the Lonestar chili I had been yearning for. Hope this review helps in your search for true chili.

No complaints from my hubby & spawn.  Good basic recipe, although I couldn't resist adding cumin (about a tbsp.) Hubby turned it into chili mac with good results (I ate turkey chili).  Thanks Michelle!

A very tasty recipe that I will enjoy experimenting with.  I doubled the beans (thanks to the other reviews that recommended it) and added some hot peppers for flavor.  My one complaint is that it was too watery.  Next time I will reduce the tomatoes, but otherwise a good recipe.

Nice simple recipe. I halved the recipe. I used 93% lean ground beef that was coarse ground for chili. I used the full can of beans (drained and rinsed), substituted 1 can of diced tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes, used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, omitted the salt, added 1 cup water and added 1 tsp ground cumin powder. Very nice and tasty recipe. Served with warm cornbread.

Excellent chili I did tweak it a little bit. I added green peppers to the mix along with an onion, I also used diced (and fresh ) tomatoes. I also drained the kidney beans before hand ( I thought the liquid would make it thicker, but add an odd flavor ) so away it went. also a little extra garlic another clover or two was wonderful. I skipped the oregano because of an allergy my boyfriend had and instead used parsley, paprika, and some of that crushed red pepper spice

I love this recipe and have used it a handful of times so far. It's simple and easy to tweak depending on your preference on how spicy or thick you like your chili. I only wish I could fast forward time during the hour it simmers so I could eat it sooner!

I thought this was pretty good-a bit salty for my taste-but my husband didn't think so.  Next time I think I'd cut the salt to 1 t. and maybe add a bit of sugar to cut the tomatoes acidity.

This is one of our family favorites.  I've made it many times now. The only thing I've added, and it's great with or without, is 2 tablespoons of sugar and one more can of tomato sauce. Great recipe, thank you so much for sharing this.

My family loved this chili.  We made it for a camping trip and everyone enjoyed it very much.  I made it exactly as written (using only 1TBS of chili powder to suit the kids' palates) and it was really good.  It has a slight sweetness to it that made it my husband rave over this new recipe!

Best Chili Ever!  I followed the recipe pretty close, made a few adjustments.  Added one green pepper chopped, couple stalks of celery chopped up really small and a jalapeno chopped up.  Also, used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb stew meat, used two cans of chili beans, 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 can stewed tomatoes and it was so easy and got so many compliments.  Will definitely make again and again.

I thought the chili was good. Wasn't hot enough for me, and not enough beans. I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, one can of diced tomatoes, and one can of diced tomatoes with green chili's. I also used Bushes brand chili beans which added extra flavor. Next time I will make it more spicy. I also added paprika, and cheyenne pepper.

I gave this 5 stars because it is a very good basic recipe. When you start with a basic recipe like this you can always add the seasonings that you like.  Personally I do not like cumin and most recipes will call for it so I really liked one that did not include it, even though I would have left it out had it been included.  Also do not like oregano so I reduced by half.  Thanks for taking the time to share your recipe.

This is a very good, but very basic chili recipe. I added some brown sugar. My two year old couldnt get enough.

My husband said this was the best Chili I'd ever made.  Of course, I had to improvise according to what was in my pantry.  I cut the recipe in half.  I only used 1 large jar of stewed tomatoes (homemade from my friend) and 2 cans of PC Smokin Stampede beans in BBQ sauce, no tomato sauce.  A little cornstarch to thicken and it was perfect.

I liked the flavor of this recipe, however, I added onion salt and a little garlic powder. Drained liquid from each of the following: kidney beans, a can of corn, and black beans. I only used 3/4 can of the whole kernel corn. I didn't include the beef (I'm a vegetarian) and I found the flavor really nice.

This is a good basic chili recipe as it stands.  I love chili because it's something that can altered in so many ways.  I love that there's even controversy as it where it should contains or be beanless, should use cubed meat, pulled meat or no meat.  There are very few chili recipes I haven't liked - thanks for this one for my collection.

So easy and so hearty.  Personalize it with things like frozen sweet corn and a touch of brown sugar or molasses.

I have to agree, combine the taste of this chili with its ease, it deserves 5 stars.  IMO, some of the simplest recipes are also the best.  The only thing I did differently was that I used two 24 oz. cans of stewed tomatoes instead of four 15 oz. cans, and added fresh oregano.  Topped the bowls off with shredded cheddar, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips...mmmmm.  I will also freeze some for chili cheese dip later on and for taco salads.

I rated this 5 stars, because on its own, it truly is THE BEST as a basic starter chili, and leaves so many options open for variation, depending on one's own mood and tastes. WHAT I CHANGED: 1 lb. gr. turkey; 2 cans beans, rinsed; 2 cans Red Pack diced tomatoes with chilis.  I also doubled up on chili powder and added a couple shakes of cilantro and Old Bay seasoning, for a unique, balanced flavor. Cook all in a crock pot for an hour on high and about 3 hours on low. I'll never make chili any other way again, after revamping everything I knew, thanks to this very simple, very crowd-pleasing treasure!

I love this chili with my own revisions.  I made mine as follows :  I use the 2lbs of ground sirloin, all the spices that the recipe called for plus some cumin,coriander, and a pinch of nutmeg.  I add 2 cans of chili ready tomatoes, 1 can of rotel,  1 8oz can of tomatoe sauce, 2 cans of chili beans with the juice and 1 can of ranch style beans with the juice. I throw it all in the crockpot and put it on low all day so at the end of a chilly day at my 2 son's football practice it is nice and warm and ready.  I serve it with cornbread and salad and of course toppings for the chili such as sourcream, pepperoncinis, jalapenos, cheese, olives, and tortilla strips.

This is a great Chili if your looking for a quality chili that doesn't take much time, ingredients and overall labor. I myself use turkey meat. Much healthier for you. I also used two cans of 'chili' tomato's and two cans of stewed tomato's rather then 4 cans of just stewed. I added a few dashes of Franks Red Hot, cumin and a bit of red pepper to spice it up. I also used a tbsp of tomato paste to thicken it up a hair. It was really great. In less then two hours you have a chili that looks like you spent all day preparing. Try it.

For the record Michelle, this recipe is far most the best and easiest one I ever made and tasted.  I did a slight variation on my own to make it go over the top of the rating charts! I replace the oregano with italian seasoning, diced tomatoes, 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 tomato paste, tbsp of canjun seasoning, crushed red peppers for a bit of a natural kick and you got the best tasting chili this side of the West Coast! Well, at least with my family.  Thanks for a great foundation of a masterpiece that is born...lol  GREAT JOB!

I loved this chili!  So tasty!  I added a tin of mushrooms and some extra chili powder.  Also for some extra goodness I topped it with a little shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream, and served with tortilla chips.  My boyfriend loved it.  I will make this again!

Great base recipe, but it needed a few things to really fit the bill.  I left out the tomato sauce and added 2 oz of tomato paste and 1/2 c. of beef broth instead.  I added 1 1/2 t. of cumin, an extra clove of garlic, dash of worcheshire, 1/2 t. more salt, 2t. sugar and 1/4t cayenne.  It's awesome!

Can we say, "Zero stars"???  Aftter adding practically half a bottle of both cumin and cilantro, this was still the most tasteless chili I've ever made!  I'll be sticking with my mom's recipe, thank you very much...it may be more work and takes longer, but the flavor is at least worth it!

Really good basic chili. There is so much you can do with this. I've been experimenting with it and it comes out great every time. I used roasted garlic this last time and it was just wonderful. I added more beans too. Will be making this alot this winter.

Great basic chili. After reading other reviews, I added a can of Ro*tel tomatoes along with the stewed tomatoes. Also added half a can of Herdez hot salsa verde. It turned out just great. Thanks for such a good, basic chili!

Great easy chili!  I thought the meat and bean ration was a little off for my tastes, so I did a little less meat and more beans.  Also, based on another review I added a little cumin and a little cocoa.  I made it the 2nd time tonight and I think I did a little too much cocoa!  But this is great and delicious and simple.  I love it!  Oh, I also didn't put in the liquid from the beans so it would be just a little thicker for my hubby.

Made this tonight for a chili supper fundraiser at my daughter's school.  It was very tasty!  It's sweeter than the chili I usually make but it was a nice change.  I'll probably make it again.

This recipe with a couple tweaks is _hands down_ the best chili I've made. I added about another half a tablespoon of chili powder (the mexican variety), 2 jalepenos, and 2 heaping teaspoons of freshly ground cumin and doubled the kidney beans (went with half light, half dark). Also, use 90% lean meat and skip the draining. That's where all the flavor is. Seriously. :D

This chili recipe was just ok. I added cumin and crushed red pepper to make it better. To me its just not chili without that cumin taste and red pepper for a spicy kick. And I only chopped one large onion. But a good basic recipe.

I've been making this chili for several years.    I like the fact that it is so simple.  The only change I make is to use black beans instead of kidney and sometimes 'notch' it up for those who want it spicier.    Everyone who has ever tasted it goes back for seconds.

Good, with some changes. 3 cans of tomatoes, used 2 cups of my own homemade beans, seasoned the ground beef with Suszy Q's pepper blend, & added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar when I added the beans. I think 4 cans of tomatoes would have left it a bit runny but it turned out good otherwise. Good base recipe!

Excellent base chili but very soupy. The second time, I used 1/2 lb ground beef, 1/2 lb ground lamb and instead of garlic salt oregano & onion, used the entire packet of Lawry's chili powder (yes, I am supremely lazy). Since I halved the recipe I used I can diced tomato and one can tomato sauce, and substituted 1-2 cans Bush's chili beans in place of the kidney beans. Also, added cinnamon and cayenne pepper. This is a great recipe to build on to create your own version suited to your taste.

This was a great recipe, simple yet delicious i did add more beans and bacon just because I personally like chili a little chunkier and for more depth i added also tomato paste and a touch of brown sugar.

This is just what I was looking for-- a basic chili recipe that can be adapted according to what you have on hand.  It was great; we had no leftovers.  I used only one pound of beef and less onion, diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of stewed tomatoes, and I added diced red bell pepper and an extra can of beans.  My beans were kidney beans already in chili sauce, so that added to the flavor.  I had no chili powder, so I used paprika, cumin, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper to make up for it.  Added a few dashes of Tobasco for heat. Thanks for the simple, quick recipe.  It will be my standard chili recipe.

This is my favorite go to chili recipe, I just add more beans and only lb ground beef. I also add 1 teaspoon cocoa powder and double up on the chili powder to give it more of an authentic taste.

This recipe was very good.  After reading others' reviews I did 2 cans Mexican flavored stewed tomatoes and 2 cans regular stewed tomatoes ... and I'm sorry I did.  I WILL make this again using the 4 cans of REGULAR stewed tomatoes.  The only other thing I did different was to add a large can (28 oz?)of tomato sauce instead of the 14 oz.  I think the end result was perfect ... not too thick, not too loose.  Served with homemade corn bread, chopped onions, shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  YUMMY!

This chili is delicious!  I followed the advice of some other reviews and made some changes:  added a can of chili beans for a thicker consistency, added some chopped green pepper, added a lot more chili power to increase the flavor and give it a little heat, and used a can of diced tomotoes with green chilies.

I agree with the comment to double the beans.  beyond that, this was great chili for the kids, but lacked depth of flavor for the grownups.  I added some garlic to try and bring the flavor out, but that wasn't enough of a fix.

Fantastic!  I made this a no-bean chili for my picky husband and we both loved it.  To compensate for the missing beans, I added a large diced green pepper and 2 stalks of finely chopped celery.  It was wonderful.  I'll definitely make this again.  Also, this makes a HUGE quantity.

There is a reason I am only giving this 3 stars. I think this is an excellent chili, but it has WAYYYYYYY to much salt. I would advise cutting the salt in half or even more. Second it needs more beans! 
I made this last night for supper....I doubled the recipe.... and to get rid of the saltiness I added a big can of bushs baked beans(the original one) and 3 more cans of kidney beans, but when I added the extra beans I left the liquid out. 
The chili was actually really good, we liked it with all the extra beans in it. I will definately make this again, but just without so much salt.

I wish I could give this 10 stars! It's so versatile - make it HOT, medium, or mild. I make this a lot for parties and always am asked for the recipe. If you are looking for an easy chili recipe that is absolutely delicious, stop looking - you've found it.

Very simple and easy to prepare. The only time that this chile takes to prepare is to fry the hamburger meat. I put the beans in when I put in the tomatoes and seasonings. In addition, it is so nice to have a recipe that most of the country has the ingredients in their kitchen on any given night. It does not seem like chile could be tasty in such a short cooking time but this recipe makes it possible. Thank you for this recipe.

I love it, especially because my boyfriend, daughter, and 3 year old son ate it up so fast! They loved it! I didn't have the amount of stewed tomatos that the recipe called for so I used one can of diced tomatos, and two 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce.It worked for me. I made a half batch of the chili. It all turned out perfectly. My bf didn't even mind the onions!!

AGREE! Great, simple chili that doesn't take much timeor ingredients. I also added cumin. I think this seasoning adds sweet/spicy to the taste. My picky family loved it and asked for more. I put it in the crock pot to simmer all day and it just melted all the flavors together. CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS RECIPE!

Good basic recipe. Easily modified. Been using this recipe for a few years now and usually make the following modifications...
I add 1 or 2 finely chopped Jalepenos and a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce when browning the meat. I also use 1 pound of ground chuck and a pound of mild sausage. Always add a fresh tomato or two and some extra cumin. Then a few cayenne peppers for good measure. And of course I use a few extra cloves of garlic.

That being said you can follow the recipe verbatim and come out with good chili.

Excellent starter recipe! Very easy to modify by adding any little extras you might personally enjoy. My husband and I like a little more heat to our chili so we chopped up several green chilis and cooked them up with the burger. We also added a couple of tsps of cayene pepper and several dashes of Louisiana hot sauce which gave the chili a very subtle tang under the heat. I also add a second can of beans minus the juice as we like a few more beans as well. Will definitely make again. We loved it! :)

This recipe makes a really good pot of chili!  I would recommend using a good quality chili powder.  I also blend the tomatoes in the food processor so the kids don't have any "chunks" and add an extra can of beans to the pot.  We love it!  Thank you.

The great thing about this recipe, you can alter it according to your tastes.  We like beans so I doubled the amount of beans but drained the liquid so the chili would remain thick.  I also didn't have fresh garlic and onions on hand so I used dried and it still tasted fine.  As it's cooking you can add more of anything to adjust it to your liking.

This was a huge hit!  I added another can of beans and then added some taco seasoning to give it a little more kick.  I garnished with sour cream, shredded cheddar, chopped jalepenos, and green onion.  It made a huge pot and I was hoping to have leftovers to freeze for a later date, but I invited DIL's over and we only had a small bowl left!

Great Chili!  Like other chefs I made a few adjustments.  I put in 3 cans of diced tomatoes with Italian spices, extra garlic, 1 onion, lots of celery, a little japanese beer, bell peppers, in place of the spices I used a chili-oh mix, salt, a few dashes of garlic salt, and more beans than the recipe calls for including 1 can of pinto beans and more kidney beans.  It took awhile to cut everything up but it was well worth it.  My family loved it and I served it with hot cornbread, delicious!!  I highly recommend it for your family on a cold night ~enjoy

Wonderful! Simple and so easy to adapt to personal preferances! I used it at a chili bar party and put out about 12 different toppings to go with it! I got a fantastic reputation as a great cook and was told what a wonderful winter party idea. Thanks so much!

I made this for dinner tonight; my husband and I absolutely loved it. It's very flavorful and tasty, a nice hearty chili. I added cumin and bell peppers and left out the beans, keeping everything else the same; next time we'll try it with beans. We will definitely have this for dinner again!

This was a good basic chili recipe for a variety of tastes.  I added an extra can of beans (1 drained, 1 not), 3 cans of Rotel tomatoes w/chiles (drained - used these in place of the stewed tomatoes), an extra 1/2 lb of ground beef, 1 large green pepper, an additional 8 oz of tomato sauce, 1 tsp of cumin powder, increased the chili powder to 2 1/2 T, and omitted the oregano.  I cooked this in the crockpot for an hour on high then turned it down to low for about 5 hours.  Served it with crushed Fritos chips, sour cream and shredded cheese.  It was delicious!  We had also had chicken & rice soup that night (family function) and this one was gone right away!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Well, I would have to say that this is "MY" new chili recipe!  Like many other reviewers here I did swap out the stewed tomatoes for 4 cans of Ro-tel with green chilies. Added a 1/2 can (3oz) tomato paste and my 2TBS chili power were heaping. Also added another can of red kidney beans, I do like the ratio of more beef than beans but after we have this tonight I'll freeze it till Super Bowl and bring it out again, this will make a bit more. I like this basic recipe, sometimes we can get caught up in the more exotic flavors like coffee, chocolate, beer and even lard.....shudder, that we forget what the original recipe even was.
Thanks Michelle for submitting it.

Very good and simple recipe that you can tweak to suit your own tastes.
People! It is CUMIN, not chili powder that makes chili taste like chili. So, if your chili tastes like pasta sauce, add cumin, not more chili powder.

This recipe had WAY TOO MUCH TOMATO! I even cut the 4 cans of stewed tomatoes down to 2, it was overpowering. Not sure why everyone loves it so much. Won't be using this one again.

This recipe was amazing! Everyone enjoyed it! The one thing I did change was that I added an extra 3 - 4 tablespoons of chili powder and some extra seasoning like garlic and onion salt and some basil.

Very good basic chili recipe; added 1 tsp cumin, substituted pinto beans (drained) for kidney beans. Next time will add a bit of cocoa powder for a little more richness.

This is really great! Having read the reviews that said the flavor was not so great I added a package of McCormick Chili Seasoning Mix in addition to the 2 TBS of chili seasoning the recipe specified. I also used spicy stewed tomatoes. (there are many different flavors of them in stores) and it helps when trying to spruce flavors. I served it with elbow noodles, (all out of spaghetti noodles), topped it with a little shredded cheese and onions and voila!! I will definitely have it again.

This chili is easy to make.  I did add Tabasco to mine and husband's bowl for a spicy kick.  The only thing I did not like, well it seems pretty plain.  I prefer chili with a more individualized taste, but I will keep working with this one.  It's a good place to start.

Excellent starter recipe.  I actually increased this recipe x4 for a chili fundraiser this week.  I used diced tomatoes, prepared chopped garlic, and red and white kidney beans for colour, as well as added some cumin.
I also made this recipe as a vegetarian version.
Exactly the base recipe I was looking for.  Thank you.

I used this recipe and think it is a good basic recipe that will make a real good pot of chili, even when you tweek it a bit, which most home cooks seem to do. I substituted one 8oz can  of El Pato sauce for one can of tomato sauce in order to give it a slight kick. I used a can of black beans (drained) and one can of pinto beans(drained). I also used 1# ground beef and 1/2# ground turkey, because that is what I had on hand. I think it tasted pretty darn good! I am letting it set overnight to absorb the flavors and will serve it at a Halloween Trunk-or Treat activity the next evening.

i almost doubled the chili powder and added cayenne pepper to preference and cooked some macaroni on the side for people to add. with sour cream, cheddar cheese & fritos, this is a great chili! i love the broken up stewed tomatoes instead of petite diced like other recipes. it's hardier.

This is a good basic chili recipe! I sauteed the meat, garlic, and onions in a pan, and then I added the rest of the ingredients in the crock pot and let it simmer for a few hours. 1 used my store brand of "chili ready" tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes, and I used 3 cans instead of 4. I think it would have been too soupy if I had added the 4th can. I also reduced the chili powder to roughly 1 tablespoon, because I was worried that 2 tablespoons would be too much. I paired this with warm homemade biscuits! This is my new go-to chili recipe.

This recipe was amazing, I did use one can of rotel diced tomato with peppers and 3 can's of stewed tomatos. I used 1 can of kidney beans and one can of red beans and poured about 1/4 of the juice out and added the rest to the chili. Also I cooked it for an additonal 40 minutes. Topped it with shredded cheese,sour cream and grenn onion. Will for sure make this again

As mentioned several times the recipes needs more beans. I added 2 cans of beans and a can of the diced tomatoes w/green chilies. By adding these extra ingredients I felt like it needed more chili powder and added an extra tbls.

This chili is wonderful.  I put 3 tbls of Chili powder, 2 teaspoons of dried oregano, 2 teaspoons of cumin, added a bottle of dark winter ale, fresh chopped green peppers and a can of corn to this chili.  It smelled heavenly while it cooked.  I also added 2 teaspoons of white sugar.  Thanks Michelle for a great recipe!

I have to admit this is a very good basic chili recipe for those who do not have a lot of spices in their cabinet or do not like a lot of spice. The first thing I noticed missing was cumin. I would suggest adding one teaspoon maybe two of cumin. If you need more spice another tablespoon of chili powder will help quite a bit. I also suggest 2 cans of beans. If you have the following try a tablespoon of Worcestershire. I did use two cans of diced tomatoes and 2 cans of stewed and to thicken I did use 1 tablespoon of corn starch. Corn starch is a very effective thickener so if you are unsure start with 1 teaspoon and move up from there. If it is not hot enough try adding 1/4 teaspoon increments of cayenne pepper.

Wonderful!  This makes a huge amount of chili so I cut the recipe in half and made a few minor changes.  Used 2 cans of mexican style stewed tomatoes (have jalepenos in them)instead of regular stewed.  Added 1/4 tsp cocoa powder and 3 Tbsp of tomato paste and an extra can of kidney beans.  This had plenty of flavor and just the right amount of heat.  As a side note for those of you who like HOT...try mexican chili powder..it has a little more kick than regular chili powder!

This recipe is good to start with, but I add a few things to make it even better.  Try adding a small can of tomato paste and 2 T sugar.  I also use 1/2 tsp of garlic powder in place of the fresh garlic because I don't normally have fresh garlic in the house.  This chili also has the right amount of beans.  Most chili recipes have too many so if you don't like a lot of beans in your chili, then this recipe is for you.

It was good and quick in a pinch.  I think that it was a little sweet for me. My husband thinks that it was the tomatoes.  It made a TON and I froze half for the next rainy day we have.  I'll probably make it again.

This chili is so great and simple.  Alot of other recipes are way over the top.  I like to blend 3 cans of the stewed tomatoes for a thicker sauce.  I add 1 can pinto beans and half a small can fire roasted mild chile. I cook everything down and then transfer to the crock pot on low for several hours. I add fresh jalapeno individually.  Over a baked potato....mmmm!!

A great basic chili recipe to build from. Throw in whatever veggies you like in your chili. Also, I like my chili withmore heat so I through in a LOT more chili powder, and a few jalapenos.

Good basic chili recipe.  I think it's a good recipe for someone learning to cook as there's a lot of room for tweaking.  I did some tweaking myself including: adding two seeded and chopped jalepenos for some heat as well as adding 1 more tablespoon of chili powder.  I didn't use the liquid from the kidney beans because it was already as liquidy as I wanted it. Turned out very good!

This was an okay basic chili. I cut the recipe in half and there was way more than enough for four portions. I followed other reviews by using 1/2 diced tomatoes and 1/2 diced tomatoes with green chilis and also added much more chili powder than the recipe calls for, but there was still no kick to it. Something was missing.

I have been making this chili since 2004. It's the best!  I have found that by substituting 1 or 2 cans Rotel for 1 or 2 cans tomatoes, it adds a bit more punch.  I also use mild chili beans in place of kidney beans.  Great Recipe!

This chili recipe is so good. I am not looking for another one! I did add more beans- 1 can of kidney beans, 1 can of bush's chili beans. Next time, I would even add some more, a variety of different kinds, and some corn. The longer you simmer it, the better it tastes. Cashews would be a great texture addition. This is a great recipe just the way it is, and as a base for some twists.

I wasn't as impressed as other reviewers.  It was okay, but not in comparison to some chili I've had.  I subbed Chicken for beef because that's what I had on hand and added some zucchini.

So good everybody got seconds. Great chili base w/very mild flavor thats not complicated. I did add a little more garlic, chili powder and beans. Lots of flavor but not spicy. Paired this w/some buttery cornbread. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

This was my first time making chili and the recipe was very easy to follow.  I did make some adjustments to the recipe.  I found it to be a bit soupy for me, but I think the next time I will drain the diced tomatoes because I didn't this time.  My husband and kids really loved it and I was so proud of myself!

Oh my gosh! This was amazing! Everyone loved it! They had seconds, even ate the leftovers, even though there wasn't much left. : D 
We used ground sirloin instead of ground beef and I cut up the tomatoes and advised by another reviewer. Other than that, I tossed in a few bay leaves and let it stew. I don't think I can rave about this recipe enough! It was so flavorful, so meaty and it didn't have too many beans (my husband doesn't like them). Yay! Thanks a ton for this. I will make this again and again! And again!

This was my first attempt at making homemade chili. I used this recipe as a guideline and made a couple of changes. First of all, I did not add the salt specified in the recipe. Another reviewer said it was too salty and I'm sure they were right. It was plenty salty enough with all of the other ingredients. I added a 6 oz. can of tomato paste. Additionally, I added a 15 oz. can of spicy chili beans. I used 2 TBS of garlic powder and 1 TBS of unsweetened cocoa, I saw it in another recipe, I had some here, so I threw it in! I had adjusted the servings to 4 instead of the 8 that was originally on the recipe. It was very delicious! I couldn't stop taste testing it! I will be making this again if it ever gets cold again here in Florida!

Good base recipe. I read off other reviews and subbed 2 cans stewed and 2 cans diced tomatoes in and I added a can of red beans. I also only used one onion. I like the fact that it takes little time to make (compared to others)

This is a good starter chili recipe. I used an extra can of kidney beans rinsed and drained. Also I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and 1 can of original Rotel. It could certainly use a tiny bit more of chili powder and a little sugar to balance the acidity of all the tomatoes. I served this chili over a bed of rice topped off w/ shredded cheddar jack cheese and piece of homemade cornbread. Certainly hit the spot on a cold winter night! Thanks!

Made this in a pinch. Didn't change a thing. It was perfect as is, and super quick. Now I crockpot it. I serve with cornbread and a salad.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't have noodles, potatos, beer, cola, etc.  Just a good chili, and this was it.  The only modification I made was using more beans than the original called for.  Excellent!

I did not make this exactly as written so maybe I should not rate this.  But bottom line is...I liked this recipe.  I added the spices we like and doubled the beans and it turned out great.  Thank you.

My favorite chili recipe to date. I followed some other suggestions like more chili powder, less onion, less tomatoes (I used diced). Very well liked.

My husband made this chili for us the other day, and it was awesome! We did change the amount of garlic though. We used one clove instead of four and we also added cayenne pepper. We did cook it longer too, and that made it very thick and tasty.

I'm sooo glad I found this recipe! It's simply a great pot of chili, without a bunch of dressing up. The flavor is wonderful, and I've never had leftovers (more's the pity!)I've used this recipe with turkey, beef, even venison, and if you need to feed alot of people on a shoestring, grab a box of crackers and make a double batch. I guarantee you'll have rave reviews!

This is a good, basic chili. Easy to make and tasty. If you're wanting to make something simple, start here and you can slowly start adding and experimenting to make it your own. My mom doesn't really like chili, but she enjoyed this. It makes a great topper to pasta also.

This was a great chili recipe!  Try it if you're looking for a normal, fast & simple chili recipe.  A friend of mine who can be pretty hard to please said this is now his favorite chili recipe!  I added 1 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp ground white pepper.  Delicious!

This really is a no fuss, delicious basic chili recipe.  I encourage the use of stewed tomatoes as is called for in the recipe - I used diced based on one of the reviews and wish that the chunks of tomatoes were less present.  It's mild tasting that is easily kicked up with some good hot sauce - also, use Two cans of beans to drive it home!!

THIS WAS AWESOME. I DID HAVE TO USE SOME CHILI MIX BECAUSE I RAN OUT OF CHILI POWDER. PLUS I ADDED A LITTLE BIT OF CUMIN AND SOME MUSHROOMS. NEXT TIME I MIGHT SUBSTITUTE HALF THE STEWED TOMATOES FOR DICED BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF A PAIN BREAKING THE STEWED TOMATOES APART. THIS MADE ALOT. IM GOING TO MAKE CHILI CHEESE DOG POT PIE AND CHILI CASSEROLE FROM THIS WEBSITE WITH THE LEFTOVERS.

THIS is a 5 star recipe!  It is going to replace the family recipe I have used for years!  I made one change because I halved the recipe...I still used a whole can of beans and tomato sauce, even though the recipe said to use half of each when it calculated a half recipe.  It was PERFECT with a whole can of each to the 1 lb. of beef!  Just the right thickness and flavor...thanks for the easy, yummy recipe!

Good. We use diced tomatoes instead of stewed. Also, we drain the beans (can't you just hear the magical fruit song playing when you don't drain them well?) and sometimes use 2 cans and more chili powder. Usually don't use the full amount of oregano, just personal preference.

REALLY, really good chili!  I did add some chopped jalapeno with the meat and onion.  I also added about 1 teaspoon of cumin.  I cooked mine in the crockpot all day.  The flavors were nicely blended.  It was great!  Thanks Michelle!

This was very good chili! I cut the recipe in half but still added a whole can of kidney beans and a whole can of tomato sauce. I had to add lots of chili pepper and wish I would have added even more than I did. It was a great basic recipe though!

This recipe was very good. However, it was a little watery. I added an extra can of kidney beans and drained them instead of adding them with the liquid. Next time I make this I will drain the stewed tomatoes, that might solve the problem. I also added a lot of extra chili powder. Good recipe!!

This was a great recipie to us for cooking chili for the first time.  I will be making this recipie again, and spicing it up a little bit.  The chili was great, and will make a perfect base for something with a little more kick.

An excellent and fast recipe.  I added extra chili powder and some red pepper flakes to make it hotter.

I didn't have any tomato sauce so I added 1 small can tomato paste and about 2 cups water to the ingredients. I believe it turned out quite nice.

I didn't have any ground beef so I used hotdogs and bologna as the meat instead, and white kidney beans instead of red ones (they were in my cabinet and needed to be used up). I halved everything for the recipe and only used half an onion. I also added red pepper flakes to make it spicier. It turned out so well! It was a great mix of spices and I wasn't expecting to taste as much like chili with the hot dogs but they worked out so well with it!

This was perfect! We swapped 1/2 the tomatoes for tomatoes with chilis and added a little cayenne. We used bush's medium chili beans instead of kidney beans. My kids say " this is way better than that OTHER chili you used to make" : )

I have made this many times.  It is really good. I have made this for a class full of first graders and they all loved it. I have made this for a high school soccer team; they scarfed it down.  It’s a good, easy, throw it in a crock pot and go, kind of meal.

This was pretty good and I will be making it again. Super easy to make and very customizable. I added a bell pepper, jalapeño and Serrano pepper. Also added some cumin and extra beans. Spicy and hearty and good enough to take to people's houses.

Personalizing chili is all the fun.  This is a great basic chili to start with. We bring green onions, sour cream, cheese, jalapenos to the table and people can add what they want at the table. We loved the chili as a beginning to a great meal.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I did use a couple of suggestions from other reviewers and put in 2 tablespoons of cumin and substituted a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies for one of the cans of stewed tomatoes. I mixed half of the spices in with the meat mixture after it was drained and then added the rest in with the tomatoes. I forgot to cover it so it ended up very thick I will cover it next time.

Really, really good chili!!! As usual, I read the comments before making any recipe in order to improve on the original. I am rating this recipe as a base. It may well be great on its own, but I wanted ingredients that weren't included. I added half cup of celery, tsp of nutmeg, and  tbsp of cumin. I used 1 large can of diced tomatoes and 1 large can of stewed tomatoes. I brought  all ingredients to a slow boil, then put in crock pot for 4hrs on high. Was a little too liquids for my liking, so added tomato paste ( 1 can) and still, added  1 tsp of corn starch and 1 tsp of water combined, to thicken. Served with Caesar salad and garlic bread.....delish!!!! Thanks for sharing!!!!!

kids are ALWAYS asking for this. they will even cut out pre-dinner snacks so they have room for seconds or even thirds. As is the recipe is awesome, however this is one of those dishes that has plenty of room to make it your own. one thing you might not think of, and it is worth a try, serve over vegetable spaghetti. it increases nutritional value but more importantly the taste and texture is a perfect compliment. don't use vegetable noodles or fettucine, it is not the same.     Thank You for sharing "Michelle"                P.S. my southern parents love it too

I made this chili for this past Super Bowl and everyone loved it. Making it again this evening. I only used 3 cans stewed tomatoes instead of 4 and added extra chili powder and 1 can of chili beans. Delicious!

Just made this and so happy I did.  This tastes just like Mom's!!!!!  A few tweaks were , add approximately 1-2 bites of dark chocolate, about 2 tsp. brown sugar, 1 green bell pepper ( cut in large chunks, for flavor), and just a splooch of worcestershire sauce.  I use Lea & Perrins.  I also like spaghetti in mine!

This was really flavorful but it did resemble the flavor of pasta sauce because of the oregano.  We added an extra can of beans drained, only used one white onion, and added some cayenne pepper to give it a kick.  We'll try this again but back the oregano off quite a bit to maybe only 1/2 teaspoon at the most.

We liked this but felt it needed a little help. I cooked a Lb of bacon in microwave crunched it into chili. Also added a TAblespoon of brown sugar, a swirl of Stubbs smoked mesquite barbecue sauce and a bottle of beer as it thickened.  It was not a spicy chili for those that like chili but can't handle the spice for tummy reasons. . This is VERY kid friendly. ( alcohol burns off)
Also the beer did not make it rsoupy.  Great with corn bread!

absolutely delicious !  My family loved this recipe.  I did one substitution (petite diced tomatoes in lieu of the stewed tomatoes).  I also added 1 Tbsp cumin and 2 Tbsp sugar, and cooked it in the crock pot.  The best chili recipe I have had!

This was such a simple and quick way to make chili! I tweaked the recipe just a bit. I followed this recipe kind of like a skeleton and just started adding some other things. I did replace two of the cans of stewed tomatoes with 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies. I also added a second can of kidney beans and added two cans of black beans (I don't like my chili soupy, I like it thick). One other small thing that I did was add just a few pinches of red pepper flakes because my roommate specifically requested it to be spicy, Overall, it turned out amazing and I am going to make it again in the near future!

Awesome chili! Only thing is, it definitely needs cumin. With so much oregano, it tasted really good, but more like spaghetti sauce. The cumin made it taste like chili. I also added more chili powder for the classic taste. Loved it!

I have been making this recipe for 3 or 4 years now. It's very good but I would give it a 4 star as listed. I have added a few things to make it better and a 5 star!! 1 tsp. cumin, 2 tsp. ground black pepper, 5 tbsps. minced garlic and I use 4 total cans of beans, I use 1 black, and mix up light and dark kidney beans for the rest. I also add 4-6 chopped fresh peppers (red, yellow, orange, green, etc.)I'm in the process of making it today and the house smells delicious. After I finish it I throw it in a large crock pot and keep on low until ready to eat. Delicious!!!

This is the 2nd time I've made this chili and while it is basic, it is very good!  I've always struggled to get the right mix of spices when I made chili--sometimes it was good and sometimes, just OK.  I never would have thought to put oregano in chili, but I have never cared much for cumin, so this recipe works for me. While we don't like really spicy food, I do put in a few shakes of red pepper flakes in--just enough to give it a little kick. I used my own crockpot cooked pinto beans, so very economical. I definitely used more than one can's worth, though!! Thanks for the recipe, Michelle!

Excellent recipe, I don't like kidney beans so I added chick peas instead, I also use a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes with chilies. It had just the right amount of spice.

It's good, easy and fast. But I did change it a bit. I added some cumin, and brown suger.  I cooked it in the crock pot for about 4 hours or so. It comes out good. I think the origial recipe is a bit to plain for my family we are spicy eaters. So Yes adding some chili peppers or so helps it out to. I do not like beans of any kind so I added sausage and grown beef.

I enjoyed this chili, no fuss comfort food.  It's easy to add or omit things to personal preference but it is also very good on its own. Thanks.

I really like this recipe because it is a great base that is easy to make to your own taste.  I use petite diced tomatoes (after trying a batch with the stewed tomatos)and a can of mild chilie beans instead of kidney beans.  I adjusted the seasonings to my taste.  I cut back on the chili powder and added some Old Bay.  I do recommend sauteing the onions first then add the garlic then the meat.  And season beef with salt & pepper while it is cooking.

This recipe drew me in because it was supposed to be easy and quick.  After reading the reviews I figured that that I might be doing myself a favor by tweaking some of the recipe details a bit.  I added a green and red bell pepper; kept the seeds.  I also fried some smoked bacon and chopped that into the recipe as well.  I added two types of beans; chili and kidney.  I also used two cans of diced tomatoes and 2 can of the rotille (sp?) tomatoes with peppers.  I started by sauteing the onions and peppers with salt; I then added the beef which I also seasoned.  I know it doesn't sound like it but other than that I kept the recipe the same except that I added a ton more chili powder and about a tablespoon of cumin and doubled the oregano and added about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. I also added a can of corn to the recipe! After that it was all the same :)  And it was delicious!

Very good chili, but I added one can of tomatoes with green chilis in place of one can of the stewed tomatoes, 1 anaheim pepper, 4 habenaro peppers adn 3 jalopena peppers and it was perfect! We like spice here at my house and without the peppers, I think this would have been too bland for us.

Oregano? I should have trusted my instinct and left the oregano out. Also, even though I'm a salt lover, this was way too salty. Otherwise, it was edible, but not great.

This was so good! The only thing I did differently was leaving the beans out (I don't like beans). This will be the recipe that I will go to from now on whenever I make chili.

This is a really good basic recipe, very versatile. Instead of stewed tomatoes I use diced tomatoes. I also add a can of tomatoe soup it gives the chili a little thickness. Oh, and, I'm not really one that measures stuff so I usually add more chili powder to give it the heat that I want. Try serving it topped with a dollup of sour cream and cheddar cheese, green onions are good too.

My roomates and I made this chili last night for dinner and it was great.  I never made my chili with stewed tomatoes before so I was not sure about how it was going to taste.  I hate to say this (forgive me mom) but it was better than the chili my mom made when I was a kid. I hsve a feeling this is going to be my go to recipe for chili from now on.

I needed a good basic and universal chili with beans to serve at a gathering today.  I found this came out wonderful. I did kick the spices up a bit to a personal flavor.  Like others I found it to bland to be considered chili with the original ingredients.  Thanks so much for sharing!

My husband said it was the best chili he ever had.  I added about 1 tsp Vietnamese cinnamon, plus chili beans (mild) in sauce.  It made all the difference!

Tried the oregano, it ruined the chili. This is an italian spice, but I thought I would try it as the recipe stated 2 tsp dried oregano. I really wish I had left it out.  Otherwise the chili recipe here is probably fine. Just leave out the oregano!

Made this yesterday!  I would do this again with probably three cans of tomatoes instead of four.  I like my chili thick and this was a little too watery for me.

love, love, love, this recipe, partly because it's so basic that you can modify it any way you want to.  Personally, I doubled the garlic, used two cans of regular stewed tomatos and two cans of diced tomatos with chilis (as suggested by a previous reviewer), tossed in some serano peppers,a can of PBR(just cause I had it), red pepper flakes and a substantial amount of cayanne pepper.  Also added a can of chili beans to fill it out, because with the beer in there it was a bit thinner than it would have been otherwise.  The result was delicious!!!  Flavorful, spicy, garlicy goodness.  Awsome!  :)

Easy to make and ingredients are simple, so with that alone I am a fan of this recipe. But the taste is awesome and I too made a few tweaks here and there to personalize. I added the diced tomatoes with green chili for a bit more spice. Also a small amount of sugar to combat the bitterness of my tomato sauce. Served it over rice with melted cheese on top.

2 hot rotel, 2 stewed tomatoes and 3 TBSN chili powder.

Been adding 1 tbsn cumin as well.  Browning the meat, onions, and garlic.  Then, remove and drain.  Put tomatoes in pot and use the immersion blender to blend up the tomatoes.  Makes it great if you don't want a bunch of large tomato chunks.  
 
Very good!  Thanks!

Made this for VBS. 40 serving recipe and canned it in quart jars. I added 2 gallon cans of kedney beans from Sam's. This is a very meaty chili. More beans could be added. Use 1 gallon can of tomato puree and tomatoes. The kids ate 2/3 of what I made and really like it. Not too spicey.

This chili has a great flavor!  I followed the suggestions of 2 cans beans and 4 cans diced tomatoes (1 can S&W with chilis) instead of stewed.  This is a good chili for people who like their chili simple to make and simple in ingredients.  Giving it 5 stars for the combo of easy to make and delicious.

GREAT chili. We do use chili beans instead of kidney for a better flavor. We also use 4 cans of diced tomatoes w/green chilis, instead of stewed, for more spice. The little bites of tomatoes are SO good. We also add a little more chili powder, depends on your taste and how spicy you might like this. It is a HUGE hit in our family. We serve with saltine crackers. ENJOY and thank you for this recipe~

This is a really good chili.  I changed some things as well to make it mine.  Instead of four cans of stewed tomatoes, I added one can of diced tomatoes, one can stewed, and two cans of chili beans.  I also reduced the chili powder and onion, and it was still spicy (in a good way:)

I'm not a chili eater, so this is based on my husbands opinion. He said the flavor was good, but that the balance of meat/beans/tomatoes was a bit "off."  I followed the recipe exactly, so if I make it again I'll probably tweak it a bit. Probably another can of beans and another .5 - 1 pound of meat.  Definitely wort trying, especially when you compare the ingredient list to a lot of others on here. Simplicity can be good!

Very good chili and evenb better the next day! The only thing I did different was I used 2 cans of the rotell tomatoes, used 1 1/2 pounds hamberger and 1/2 pound italian sausage and added 1/4 C. chopped red pepper and decreased the salt by half. Easy to put together and then I let it cook for 4 hours in the crock pot.

I was so happy to find a simple chili recipes without all the weird stuff in it. I did make a couple changes, but nothing too major. I used stew meat instead of GB (personal preference), a 28oz can of stewed tomatoes, w/out the juice, can of rotel w/juice, 2 cans of kidney beans, and a can of diced tomatoes. The chili turned out sooo yummy, thanks Michelle!!

Just like the recipe says, this was a good basic chili recipe. You could really spice up the chili by adding your own touch to it. I added some mayo to make the sauce a little creamy and hot sauce to give a some kick.

We love this chili.  I always add the diced tomates with jalapeno and either a can of corn or a green pepper.  Also, a tablespoon of baking chocolate powder is a must.  Love it and will keep for my go to recipe.  Thanks.

The recipe seemed too salty to me.  I would put at least 1/2 the amount it calls for.  Otherwise, a great standard chili soup.

Very good basic recipe.  I decided to follow advice of another reviewer and put 2 cans of the tomatoes with green chilis. Dh likes spicy chili.  I also decided to add some coriander & cumin...the basic recipe tasted good but I went ahead & put the other spices in...just can't leave a recipe alone...have to tinker with it.

This is a great recipe as a base but it needed more beans and spice..I added an extra thing of beans, tomatoe sauce, tripled the spice amount and added green bell pepper and caynenne pepper.

Excellent recipe.  As with many of the previous reviewers I modified the recipe as follows: added 1 red bell pepper, 1 green bell pepper, 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes, 1 pkg taco seasoning mix, 1 can whole kernel corn.  Drained the kidney beans and added a can of black beans and a can of white beans also drained.  Instead of the 4 cans of stewed tomatoes I used 1 can Mexican Rotele, 1 can diced tomatoes with jalapenos and 2 cans of regular diced tomatoes.  Chili came out wonderful.  I added the beans when I added the seasoning at the beginning.

I was searching for a simple chili recipe.  I was tired of my current chili with it's long list of ingredients and spices.  This was excellent and simple to make.  I did add a bay leaf to the chili because I like the flavor it adds.  The whole family including my picky DD loved it.  Thanks!

I add 1/4 tea. cayenne to give it a little kick (this isn't a spicy chili by any stretch of the imagination) and 2 stalks celery for some color.  I also use 2 cans each of the tomato sauce and the kidney beans.  It's a hit every time!

Absolutely delicious.  I don't like kidney beans so I used navy beans instead.  Used just one tsp of salt.  Topped with cheddar cheese with cornbread on the side.  AWESOME!

Super Yummy, I trought it all in a crock pot on HIGH for a few hours, used ground turkey instead of beef, and added chili poweder, cumin and cayenne pepper cautiously because I don't care for spicy chili.  I made a HUGE batch and froze half to get us through... This was a BIG success with my hungry boyfriend :)

My husband and I really liked this. My 9 year old daughter wanted nothing to do with it. It could be because she is becoming a picky eater lately. My husband and I both agree it needs a little more spice and no beans next time.

Easy simple chili.  Not too hot for kids.  I added another can of beans, but that's just my preference with chili.

This is a good basic Chili recipes. I made a few changes: Used ground turkey instead of ground beef, instead of stewed tomatoes I used diced tomatoes with green chili.  Next time I will add more spice and drain the beans so that it is thicker.

This is a good starter recipe to "tweak" to your own specifications.  I used ground pork sausage and canned (rather than steamed) tomatoes.  Good overall.

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half except for the kidney beans (which I drained), added some mushrooms, and a little hot sauce. I was out of tomato sauce, so I used paste and it came out a little thicker, which I like. It was so warming on a brisk, rainy day. Pretty healthy, too! The longer it simmers, the better it tastes. I just made this again and added some chopped green pepper and cocoa powder. Even better! Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did however alter it a bit. I love spicy food! So I replaced half the stewed tomatoes with Extra Hot Rotel. Just a few less onions, and instead of Kidney Beans I used Red Beans. Wonderful Frito Chili Pie...no Jalapenos necessary! :)

As the description states, this is a good, basis chili recipe, and it doesn't take long to make.  Other than halving the recipe, I followed the ingredient list and directions exactly.  It was cool to be able to begin making this chili 15 minutes before kickoff and be eating it by 3rd quarter.  (There were a lot of time outs. :)

The only thing that gave this 4 stars instead 5 was the fact that because this recipe was so quick and didn't include a lot of ingredients, the depth of flavor that I prefer in a great chili was missing.  

It is what it is, and I will continue to use this as a "quick and easy" chili recipe.

I have made this chili several times and it is always a big hit.  So easy to make for a chili and it's even better after sitting in the fridge for a day.  I top mine with sour cream, cheese and green onion.

This was my first attempt at homemade chili, and it was excellent!  It wasn't too spicy for my little ones, and I did increase the chili powder as well.  I might add some cumin next time.

This was such a simple recipe. I used two cans of kidney beans, and substituted 2 cans of stewed tomatos for two diced w/ pepper as suggested by a previous rater. I love it.

This chili recipe was just okay. I would never make it again. It didn't have enough flavor to it.

Finally, a good chili recipe!! I only had 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, and that was plenty. I also added an extra can of red beans and a bottle of dark beer. I'm sure it would have been really good without the changes, too!

I add green pepper, a bit of celery and cumin and cinnamon to the chili. Otherwise this is a great starter recipe for making chili. Thank-you.

This is a good recipe. Definitely on my keeper list. Great mild taste, so if you want more kick to it you might want to add some peppers or more chili powder.

This was my first attempt at making chili, and I thought it was really good.  I cut it down to 4 servings, and I added more kidney beans (one full can), which was perfect to me.  My boyfriend thought it could be spicier, but usually he complains about it being too spicy.  I will definitely make this again though... it is a great base, I think.

This was so easy and everyone said that it was perfectly seasoned so that it was not too spicy but just right! The only thing I did changed was that I added about 5 more tablespoons of chili powder because some reviews mentioned it being bland...this seemed to give it just the right amount of kick it needed!  My 11 year old raved about it!! This is a keeper!

A wonderful basic chili.  Not very spicy.    I used chuck steak instead of ground beef.  Also, I added the onions at the same time as the tomatoes.

this recipe was just ok. It had too much of a tomato taste for me. It was also a little thick so added some water and a packet of chili seasoning and it was still not as flavorful as I would like. But I give it 3 star rating because it makes a geat spaghetti sauce and didnt go to complete waste.

This is awesome chili!  I love that it's not loaded with beans.  I put a TON of cumin in it as well, and about 4 times the amount of chili powder, and my 3 year old even loves it.  Best with shredded cheddar and sour cream.

I have made this recipe several times this year.  It is the BEST!  The only thing that I do differently is puree the stewed tomatoes since I do not like chunks of tomato in anything.

This is really the best chili I have ever had.  I had never made chili before so I wanted to make sure I got a pretty basic recipe so that I wouldn't mess it up.  I made this to bring camping and it was a very good choice, we heated the pot over the camping stove and everyone really enjoyed it.  I used 3 cans of diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes, everything else I followed exactly.  I can't wait to make this again!!

Wonderful! 1st time ever making chili; I added 1 tbsp Cumin, 1 tsp each of cinnamon and allspice, about 1 tbsp of sugar, doubled the chili powder and added 1 tbsp cayenne pepper & doubled the kidney beans - I drained the beans about halfway before putting them in, which I did at the beginning. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed. This made for a WONDERFUL, thick, spicy chili - thanks so much! What a great basic chili recipe for a beginner!

Great Great recipe.  Tasted like "traditional" chili.  We liked it a lot.  I didn't have quite enough cans of tomatoes on hand.  I was a can short, and it was still fabulous (oh, and one of the cans was italian seasoned, and it tasted just fine)
Yum.  Great with corn muffins!

Yummy! A bit on the salty side so I suggest using chili seasoning (1/2 packet)  and no salt. I added cumin like other sugested plus worshchester and a tsp. of brown sugar. Really good. Days after it went well with spaghetti too since it was  about the consistency of chunky sauce.

This recipe was wonderful.  I had a huge group of people here, so I customized the recipe for 25 servings.  Instead of kidney beans, I used a 1 gallon can of Ranch Style beans and I used a 1 gallon can of stewed tomatoes plus 2 15 ounce cans of diced tomatoes.  Everyone raved about this chili!!  I will definitely be making it again!!

This is a great basic chili recipe...will definitely be making this again! Instead of 2# of beef, I used 1.5 # and added a can of pinto beans as well as a can of drained sliced mushrooms. I added a couple tsp of cumin as well. Very yummy!

The taste for this was ok, but it turned out rather tomato-soupy.  Was a little diappointed, and will probably keep looking for recipies.

An extremely good basic chili recipe but I didnt have the tomato sauce and threw in a can of tomato soup and we always use diced tomatoes. Also I use 1 full envelope of a chili seasoning like Chili-o or any brand. We thought the tomato soup was so good I'll use it in place of tomato sauce in the future. Also this is good with ground venison.

I thought this recipe was great due to its simplicity.  I added some jalepeno's to spice it up some more.  Also, next time I going to add another can of beans.  But, that is just my personal preference.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Me and my wife loved this chili, although I did pre-blend the stewed tomatoes (we don't like the chunks).  Personal alterations included adding both dark and regular kidney beans for color and adding a tbsp of cumin.  Very good!  Have already made it 3 times.

I added 2 small (8 oz) cans of brown beans in tomato sauce, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and I used ground chicken rather than beef.  At step 2, I combined all ingredients in a slow-cooker.
This was my first time making chili, and it turned out excellent!!  Thanks for a great start to great chili!   :-)

I loved loved LOVED this chili recipe. The best chili ever. I made it for my husband. The only change I made was I did not have four cans of stewed tomatoes so I used two cans stewed tomatoes and two cans diced tomatoes. I also added one teaspoon of cumin. My hisband could not eat enough of this chili. I DEFINITELY will use this recipe again!!!!

Awesome chile! I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 2 cans of the diced tomatoes with jalepeno's and added 1 tsp cayenne pepper. My husband loved this and it is so much better the next day. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great chili recipe, and we only made a couple of changes as we like our chili good and hot.  We added 3 hot chili peppers and 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  We also used pinto beans instead of kidney as I didn't have kidney beans on hand.  It turned out wonderful!  Will be making this a lot this winter!

Excellent base recipe.  I added a can of Pace Picante Hot salsa for the flavour.  It's hard to go wrong when you use salsa as the spice, but you can't put it in too early if you want it to be hot.  Put it in about half way.

Excellent Chili.  I've never made it myself other than using mixes, and was dying to try it.  This recipe was easy to follow and tasted great.  I doubled the chili powder to make it a little spicier (although I typically don't like things too spicy), I just thought it needed a little more.  I added double the beans as well.  I also added bacon, because everything's better with bacon, right?

i made the vegetarian version of this and it was delicious.  i would suggest using twice the amount of kidney beans than it called for and also extra chili powder.  I also added in whole kernel corn, which was great.

This was the first chilli I ever made, and it wasn't at all what I had envisioned.  I had to add corn, mushrooms, green pepper and more beans to give it that heartiness I associate with chilli.  
Good if you like very mild and tomatoey soup, but we needed to add a healthy dose of cayenne and red pepper flakes to give it that hearty kick!

Very easy and delicious.  Anyone can make this.  I did make the following changes to this recipe: decreased stewed tomatoes from 4 cans to 2 cans, used 1 can kidney beans wliquid and 1 can wo liquid, increased chili powder to 4 T. and added pepper bacon.  I took this to work and my coworkers loved it.

This was the perfect basic chili! The great thing about this recipe is that you can start with this, and then build your chili to your family's specifications. To suit my husband's tastes I added sharp cheddar cheese, 1/2 can beer, thick-cut pepper bacon, and some onion powder. It was absolutely delicious and simple. It was also a real breeze to make even for a first time chili cook!

Very good chili--not at all hot. Goes perfect with fresh cornbread. I imagine if you wanted it hotter, you could very easily add hot spices to it and it would still taste good. Makes great leftovers, too. I wish it was a little bit thicker but overall very good chili.

There are a couple of things that I do differently because we like our chili less watery, but the basic premise is wonderful and easy to do. My fiancee loves this dish and requests it all the time because the leftovers are just as good. Thanks.

It was very good chili. I was afraid it might turn out a bit too watery and with too much tomato so I only used 3 cans.  I also added more seasoning, instead of just chili powder I had some left over taco seasoning.

This recipe is great!  It's no nonsense and easily modified.  I added jalapeno peppers and a little 'extra hot' sauce and it turned out great!  I also used 1/2 turkey and 1/2 93% ground beef and it still tasted fantastic!!! Load up on the black pepper!

Made it with slight variations, used only diced tomatoes with green chilis and in lieu of chili powder used a packet of Old ElPaso taco seasoning mix. Family loved it.

I made it for a Sunday family night dinner and then received 2 requests. One request from each daughter. So the following week I made two batches. One super spicy and the other exactly as the recipe is written. Both families loved it. Thanks for a great chili recipe.

Good Chili here! I made according to recipe but added 8 oz of garden burgers chopped as only had 1 package of ground beef. Used TJ's new chili spice blend for seasoning and one cut up yellow pepper.  Also added 2 tsp un sweetened cocoa and 1 tsp sugar, as I always do when making a dish with a lot of tomatoes. Added beans early on - no problem. Turned out great!

Like others said this was a great foundation for chili but it was soupy. So I added a can of tomato paste, did 3 cans of stewed tomotos and one can of diced tomatoes and did one can of red kidney beans and one can of white kidney beans sans liquid. Then I used 3 tablespoons of chili powder like another reviewer stated from the chili powder recipe on this site and only changed that recipe by doing the cayenne pepper to taste . https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/237172/chili-powder/

Who is making this and thinking this is what chili is supposed to taste like? This lacked flavor and spice. Would not ever use this recipe again. Fixed it up using another recipe and it's ok now. But this recipe is a big miss.

This was one of the best chili recipes I’ve made. I added corn and a pinch of cayenne pepper as well as green onions on top to garnish. It’s got a little spice to it but you could add jalapeños as well. This made enough servings for at least 12.

Made it with ground beef and another batch with soy crumbles. Both were great. Put a little cumin in them and diced tomatoes instead of one can of stewed tomatoes in the beef batch.  Served them with a little spaghetti and sprinkled with Cheddar cheese. Will use this recipe again.

This was an awesome recipe I tweaked it majorly by adding a full jar of salsa and hot paprika and instead of the stewed tomatoes I use diced tomatoes and tomato puree added onion powder and garlic powder what a phenomenal dish- also dark red kidney beans and Great Northern beans add a remarkable flavor ! Also added hot sausage to the mix

I made this and just added a pinch of cumin and one tablespoon less of chili powder.  I can’t do too much spice.  I tasted it when done and it was good!  A little soupy so I decided to add a small can of tomato paste.as leftovers I will put on top of spaghetti.

10 stars..Made the recipe after reading through a lot of the comments. TIA! My adjustments were browning the beef with 2 Tbspns garlic powder, 2 Tblspns All Purpose flour for thickener, 3 Tbspns Chili powder, 3 Tbspns Cumin, 2 tspns Oregano, 1 can stewed tomatoes, 1 can of Rotel diced tomatoes & chilies (mild), 2 cans fire roasted diced tomatoes, doubled the beans (drained).  I wanted flavor and mild heat. You can add heat individually with diced jalapenos to the bowls. Yum!

Fairly easy to make.  The only exception was that I substituted the ground beef for cube steak.  
Phenomenal!! 
Topped with sour  cheese of choice, chopped onions, and sour cream.

Really good!  I made a couple of tweaks from reading reviews.  I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes (that I'd likely switch to diced or something next time as I don't like the big pieces of tomato), 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes with diced green chilies.  I also did 2 cans of black beans instead of the kidney beans (was going to use cannellini until I realized they wree a year and a half past the use by date - haha!).  Threw in a touch of cayenne but not sure if that made the touch of heat or if the Rotel did but it had just enough heat for me.

Only thing I would change is the amount of salt.  I find the current amount way too salty.  Next time I will probably omit it entirely and only salt to taste. Otherwise, this recipe is super easy and delicious.

It was so good...I changed it up a bit though...I added 1 tablespoon cocoa, 1 tablespoon ground cloves, 1 teaspoon chipotle powder.  Instead of kidney beans I used pinto beans and garbanzo beans.  It’s got some serious depth from the cocoa.  And just the right amount of heat!

Absolutely delicious! I made it exactly per the recipe except I added an extra can of beans. Served with onion&chive sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, and Fritos corn chips. The whole family liked it...which is saying something, lol.

I love this recipe!  Have made it about 12 times now over last couple years.  I did make a few personal adjustments:
-use 1 onion vs 2
-added 1 can of Rotel (original or spicy)
-use ground sirloin vs chuck
-rough chop the stewed tomatoes before adding in
-use 1 can light red kidney beans, plus 1 can white northern beans
Awesome!!

This was great. I used ground turkey instead of beef. Also added kielbasa. If your guests want a little more spice, just have them add franks red hot w/cayenne pepper. Or add it right in.

This recipe is a decent starting point.  I recommend swapping 1 can of stewed tomatoes for an extra can of pinto/black beans for a better meat:bean ratio and less of a marinara flavor.  I also added pickled chili peppers, cumin and Sriracha sauce (to taste) for more heat.

I used this as a base for my  recipe. Before adding my own spices, I would have to say it was bland at best and definitely too much like a meaty pasta sauce. 
In the end:
I used 28 oz crushed tomato, I added a can of black beans, lots and LOTS of cumin, extra chili powder, extra diced garlic, and some smoked paprika. I also added some fresh diced tomatoes because they were going to go bad anyway.
After adding the rest of the ingredients, it tasted exactly as chili should.
So I gave it 3 stars because its a good base.

A nice simple recipe for savory chili. I added one diced jalapeño to create some heat...not too much. I used cubed steak which gave it a heartier texture. It gets better after a day or two in the refrigerator.

I used the 4 cans of stewed tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomato with jalapeño and habanero peppers.  Also I added 1 lb of hot Italian sausage. Best chili yet in our home. Even my college aged daughter loved it and she doesn’t like anything spicy.  Twerk it to your family’s tastebuds you can’t go wrong.

Really good. 
I used garlic salt in place of garlic and salt, added can of mushrooms and 1/4 green pepper. Also added paprika for more colour.
Tasted amazing. I was prepared to add a lot more spices for my fam who loves a lot. This really didn’t need much.
Good flavour. Not like spaghetti sauce at all- use your judgment when adding canned tomatoes. I only used one large can and found made enough juice.

I thought it was a great basic chili recipe. I added spices for my crew who likes it spicy. I doubled the chili powder, added some thyme, hot sauce and doubled the beans. My husband wants me add a can of beer next time. I will. Thanks exactly what I needed.

This is a very good chili but lacked any kind of heat.  I added a fresh sliced jalapeno at the beginning then needed to add more chili powder to remove the tomato flavor and a good amount of cayenne pepper to get it up to a nice heat level.  I personally like much hotter chili but my wife prefers just a small bit of heat.  I used her as the test and stopped adding cayenne when she was good with it.  As far as the rest of the recipe, the only thing I would change is add more beans.

I will definitely be making this again with the tweaks I stated above.

This came out pretty good. I didn't use stewed tomatoes, just  canned diced ones; one can flavored with basil & garlic, the other can plain. I drained the beans, as well. The seasonings were pretty spot-on.

Delicious.   I made one change. I had a package of dried beans which I soaked overnight and used instead of canned.

I read many of the reviews and added more spices (cumin, clove, red pepper flakes) as was recommended.  It was okay, nothing really great.  My family ate it but said that it was flat or thin tasting.

I followed the recipe exactly and after making it twice, I had it committed to memory. It's so simple, but so delicious! I made it for my brother and sister and they have started requesting it. Sour cream tunes it right in for me!

I've made it about 5 times over the past few months. It's a fantastic yet simple recipe for groups or large families. I made it in college and it was so good that sometimes I had to double the recipe to accommodate my friends craving. It feeds like 6-8 people and excepts personal variations really well (more seasoning  would be the only thing I add). A tip if time is the issue, drain the liquid from the tomatoes before adding them (every can you drain takes off like 15 mins of cook time so dinner in under 40 min is doable)

I was very disappointed.  It's not that its bad, just that its extremely bland and in my opinion has much more of an italian taste to it.  This tasted like a meat based spaghetti sauce.  If your food tastes lean toward the very mild and more basic flavors than you may enjoy it.  However, if you enjoy more flavor and spices than I would find something else.  I salvaged it by adding cayenne, cumin, paprika,  red pepper flakes, garlic powder and onion powder.

Super easy! I've made this several times, and my entire family loves it. I substitute chopped fresh oregano for dried, and also subbed post-Christmas turkey for hamburger once, and it was delicious.

Made this tonight per the recipe.  It was really good but way too salty!  I don't usually add salt when cooking so maybe we're just sodium sensitive. I will make this again and eliminate the added salt and maybe use low sodium stewed tomatoes.  It's a keeper!

I subbed (2) 14.5 cans Muir Glen diced fire roasted tomatoes and (1) 28 oz can Muir Glen crushed fire roasted tomatoes for the tomatoes the recipe called for. I also added a bit more salt and omitted the beans. It was good! Like other reviewers have said, it’s a great base for many different varieties.

If you just follow the recipe with out adding anything it is real sweet and basically marinara sauce. I added cumin, a little more salt, some pepper and cayenne pepper. Also added an additional can of beans. Seemed to work perfectly and got rid of that sweet tomato flavor.

I have made this recipe several times. My husband is super picky. And he loves this recipe. Took it to a few parties and mine was all gone every time. 
I do the recipe in 2 batches so that I can make one kid friendly and one nice and spicey.

The best simplest chili I’ve ever made, and I’ve made a lot of chili. I was cleaning out my pantry and didn’t have some of the required ingredients,(tomato sauce &stewed tomatoes). Used diced tomatoes with chili seasoning, and tomato paste.  It was excellent. I’m sure the original is excellent too. I wasn’t trying to change the recipe just use what I had available.

My family loved it! I used 1lb of fatty ground beef. And 1lb of chicken lefto over from a rotisserie. I left out the oregano. Added a small amount of tomato paste. Instead of traditional chili powder I added some gochuchan powder.  I also added the tomatoes much later in the receipe than was called
for. It was essentially perfect. I think I might add black beans next time as well.

Great recipe.  I added more chili powder and I used pork and ground beef.  I tasted it before I added the tomato paste and it tasted great, once I added the full can of paste, I did not like it as much.  Next time I will use half a can and see how it taste.  Family loved it !!

The chili was ok. I would try it again with a few changes. Chop the  whole stewed tomatoes from the can before putting them in the pot. The sauce was also a little sweet for a chili. I would add some fresh green peppers and jalapeño.

Added cumin and extra chili powder. Also added a chopped green bell pepper and pimento pepper from the garden.  Like another see, I added some tomato paste to thicken the chili.

I have been craving for some chili but have never liked to make them as they require too many ingredients. I found this recipe and I was hesitant since it looked so simple to make to turn out good. But I followed the tips of some of the reviews. I had some mild hot jimmy deans sausage left, so I did 1lb of that and 1lb of ground beef instead. I did 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and 2 cans of diced tomatoes with chili. I added about 1 additional tsp  of chili powder. I omitted the onion bc my bf didn’t like onions. My bf accidentally added the beans from the start so the beans ended up cooking for 1hr 20 mins. I’m not a huge bean lover, so this recipe has just enough beans for me. It turned out very good with shredded cheese topping. Will definitely make this again.

Loved it!  Because we like spicy chili, I too used rotel tomatoes, added cumin seeds, more beans, more chili powder and tomatoe paste to thicken.  I’ve been known to add a handful of  cheddar cheese near the end to thicken my chili.  (This chili was delicious, I only tweaked it for my family.)

I did not use as much chili spice or tomatoes with chilis as we are not fans of real spicy food. I also took out what I wanted before adding the beans since I can't eat them.

My boyfriend and I both thought this was delicious and will definitely be making again. I did add some chili mix to spice it up a bit (that’s the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars), but besides that followed the recipe and would recommend for an easy chili recipe.

It was good. I definitely would make sure you add something with some spice otherwise it’s a little bland. Definitely adding chili peppers or something to give it that kick you’re looking for when you have chili  next time. I will definitely use this recipe again, so easy.

I only used 1 lb of beef and .5 lbs of mild sausage. I also used a total of seven cans of light and dark red kidney beans. Without it, the recipe wasn't a true chili, in my opinion.

Michelle,
First of all of all thanks.  I’m an old man (70+) and have been making Chili almost all my adult life, always looking for the “perfect chili”.  (There is no such thing.) The wife went out to take of her business and wouldn’t be back till later, after normal dinner time, so I decided to look through my collection of Allrecipe and decided to try yours.  I’ll admit. I thought it was a little on the less than involved side but I also didn’t want to get involved in slaughtering my own hog and cow to make dinner. (Did I mention I’m gettin’ up there in years?)  I’ll tip my hat.  It’s a pretty good chili for such limited ingredients . I might try to tweet a bit but not by much.  Thanks again.

Delicious and simple. I have made this about 4 times and the last time it was for a church dinner. People really liked and and there were no left overs. I have changed the recipe slightly each time but this recipe its easy to change to what you are in the mood for. The last time I made it I added some green chili's and extra chili powder. I do feel like quality chili powder makes a big difference, so do not skimp in cheap low quality chili powder. I did use a generic chili powder once and could really tell the difference. Its a great recipe to have fun with so enjoy it!  The recipe is also great how it's written.

I made this as written and it was too soupy and didn’t have much of the flavor of chili. I then used diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. I upped the chili powder and added cumin. I used pinto beans instead of kidney beans and drained the liquid from the beans.  Much better!

I tried to stick with the original ingredients on this recipe but I ended up adding extra ingredients. In addition to the spices listed, I also added 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 tbsp red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp cayenne pepper. I also added a whole package of chorizo that I fried with the onions and garlic. I give it 4 stars because it’s a great recipe that you can modify to your liking.

I reduced the recipe to 4 servings, used minced garlic (about 2 Tbs) and added fresh black pepper. This will be my go-to chili for any occasion! So easy to make and very delicious!

I added additional chili powder, 2 cans kidney beans, cumin and two fresh chopped green peppers.  Tasted great but needs a bit of hot sauce, cheddar and sour cream on top.  Served with tortilla chips yum oh!

This is a good basic recipe. Not fancy & not hot. I added a little cumin just because it’s chili, but we were very satisfied with how it tasted. So much easier & just as good. Can make on stovetop, in Instant Pot electric pressure cooker or slow cooker.

This is by far the best chili I have ever made.  I've been cooking for 54 years and never came across a recipe like this.  I did use 1 lb. chuck and 1 lb. ground filet.  It was perfection.

This was a very good recipe! The chili was fantastic and dangerously good. Just use red onions instead of other onions, add a pinch of black ground pepper, and use red kidney beans. You can reduce the time (I did), but the more you let the flavors simmer; the better! Serves exactly 8. We even had leftovers!

Good basic recipe just as long as you cut the salt in half.  not spicy enough for my expectations of chili is supposed to taste like, but great for the taste buds of children.

I didn't have stewed tomatoes and used canned diced tomatoes instead. I used some homemade pasta sauce and the end result was the most flavorful chili I've ever had!

The only I did different was using the meet.  I used 1 pound  of ground beef and  1 pound of pork ground beef. I also used white home made cook beans no cans.  The result was great! thank you for share.

Not bad, added more chili powder to make it have a better flavor. Easy to make for a beginner like me. Next time I'm going to add jalapeno for spice.

I made this pretty much following the recipe except for the following:  

Used 1 3/4 pound of 80% Angus.
Used an extra onion.
Used 3.75 cans of diced tomatos, 1 diced with mild green chilis (Mild green chilis in tomato gave it a slight kick);
Added cumin to taste.
Added an extra can of Red Kidney beans since we like beans.
Added a large chopped green pepper while simmering for added flavor and to have more vegetables.

Beware, it is pretty soupy and i had to drain off a lot of it before ladling it into a bowl.

Once served, I topped with shredded Mexican blend and low fat sour cream.  It was pretty good!

Out of all the Chili recipes, this is my family’s favorite. My only change is I use black beans instead of kidney beans. It’s easy and quick, which I love.

Two words - Delicious & Simple!  Finally I’ve found a recipe we all enjoyed. I did follow the recipe; however, In addition I added a tbsp of sugar & a green pepper.  Just personal preference. After the initial prep & browning, I transferred it to a crockpot, on low, since I had to leave the house.  When I got back home, after 4 hours, the house smelled wonderful and we had a really great dinner ready.  Highly recommend!

I've made this recipe twice and my family loves it! Using some of the substitutions suggested by other commenters, I was able to add a bit of a kick to it! 

My brother isn't a huge fan of tomatoes, so instead of using 4 cans of stewed tomatoes, I use 3 cans of diced tomatoes (1 can del monte brand, 2 cans of sriracha brand with red chiles--gives it a nice kick!) I also added an extra 8 oz of tomato sauce, substituted black beans for the kidney beans, and used ground turkey instead of beef.

I'll continue to use this recipe! I love making a big batch and then I freeze the extra in tupperware containers. Very easy to reheat, just plop it in the pot on the stove and it's much tastier than anything you buy from the store.

perfect basic chili. Added chili powder, paprika, cumin, and two good sized cloves of garlic. I took the advice of another user and sprinkled a little smoked cinnamon. Picture to come after the cornbread is done.

The flavor was great and it was very simple to make. It was a bit too much meat for my taste though. Next time I'll just do a pound and a half of meat and switch to ground turkey for a leaner option, as well as add another can of beans.

I make this 3-4 times per season. I generally follow the recipe but substitute 2 cans of black beans with liquid instead of the kidney beans, and add 1/2 bottle of Bloody Mary mix. This gives it great flavor in addition to the spices already called for in the recipe.

Delicious and a big hit at the party I took it to.  Influenced by earlier reviews, I subbed 2 cans of diced tomatoes for 2 of the stewed, and 1/2 lb. of italian sausage for equal amount of burger, and I halved the salt.

My chili recipe.   First time making chili, I’m not a cook but entered it in a cook off. Was about 14 entered and this recipe got second place.  I doctored it a bit but this basic receipe was the core of the dish. Loved it.  (It should have won).

This was good but a little spicier than I expected. My 4 year old struggled to eat it. Also, the stewed tomatoes I bought were very large (whole rings of tomato) and I had to try to break them up as the chili cooked but still ended up with really large chucks of tomato throughout. Not sure if all stewed tomatoes are like that or if I need to look for something different next time.

Outstanding. I add various vegetables if I have them laying around. I often don’t put in the tomato sauce. I always use hot Italian sausage in addition to 1lb of beef.

Fantastic!!!!  I made a double batch for a BBQ party we hosted and entered it in a chili cookout we had.  I finished Second only because I forgot the beans.  Seems the judges determined that beans are necessary in chili.  Oh, well, I still loved it!!!!

I made a close variation of this in the 1970's. I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed and added 2 diced red sweet peppers, tomato paste 6 oz and left out the the tomatoe sauce.
AND 8 tbsp of chili powder. No one in my family likes cumin or hot spicy.  Super easy and turned out great!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I only made a half recipe and it was still quite a large batch. I only made a few tweaks. Added some cumin and cayenne everything else was pretty much as stated except I used spicy chili beans because that was what I had on hand. This is just a really good chili. You can dress it up however you like.

This was pretty easy & turned out great! But, I disagree with using FOUR cans of tomatoes. I cut it back to 2 cans of stewed tomatos, one can of tomato sauce & 1 can of tomato paste. The consistency was perfect! I also used 2 cans each of kidney beans & chili beans. We all really enjoyed the flavor & consistency, including the picky mini eaters who usually won't touch anything like this! Will definitely be making again with the slight modifications.

I added a second can of beans and a packet of dry onion beef soup mix, no other changes.  This makes a great tasty chili that works as is using basic ingredients that most kitchens have on hand.  Of course, the "add wine, zucchini and half the spices in my cabinet" group can go wild if they wish, but that will be creating a completely different recipe.

This was great. I did have to change the recipe a little.  I used low sodium kidney beans and rinsed the juices and used water  for the other beans chili and pinto, and did not add salt except for chili seasoning mix to reduce sodium intake. It still tasted great.

In my opinion this was a good recipe.  The wife and kids enjoyed it and that's what matters.  I personally would have liked to spice it up.  I adjusted the recipe a bit, in part based on some of the reviews I read.  Specifically, I only used 1 can of stewed tomatoes, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, and a little more than 15 oz of tomatoes sauce.  It was a easy recipe to prepare on a cold winters night.

Really easy to make on the stovetop in my Dutch oven. It was great. The whole family loved it. I added an extra can of beans because 1 just didn't seem like enough. You can also add some peppers if you like.

Excellent recipe, easy to adjust for spice. It came out a little soupier than I like my chili, so next time I'll drain the beans (I used two cans). Other than that, no complaints! This is a very chunky tomato version of chili, so if you don't like that style go for diced tomatoes rather than stewed.

This was exactly the "base" recipe I was looking for. Of course I made changes - everybody does! This recipe is a perfect starting point for anybody's individual taste. My alterations were first, like other reviewers, using diced tomatoes instead of stewed. Half of the tomatoes had green chilis, the other half were "fire roasted" which I just happened to see at the store and decided to try, which lended a nice smoky flavor. Then, we like it spicier so I doubled the chili powder and added some cumin. Also added some green pepper in with the meat. No drastic changes, and it came out very good.

This was good though I had to make some adjustments based on what I had on hand. I didn't have a seasoning packet for chili so I tried this. I used 1 pound of ground beef, pinto beans, 3 small tomatoes, and 1 can diced tomatoes in place of the stewed tomatoes. I added corn, celery and bell pepper. I used about 3/4 of the seasonings since I made a smaller batch.

I made it just about exactly as written with the exception of adding 2 cans of beans instead of 1. It was a bit bland but the beauty of this recipe is it's a great base to customize to any tastes, so I thank you!

I gave it 3 stars because I do like it as a base, but if you follow the recipe as is it's rather bland.  I use 2 cans stewed and 2 cans diced instead of 4 stewed.  I dont make this on the stove, i use a crockpot on high for 3-4 hrs or low for 4-6 hours. I also put in 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1/2-1 tsp ground cayenne pepper, depending on how spicy you want it, 1 tbsp paprika, 1-2 chopped bell peppers to be cooked with the beef, onions and garlic cloves (I use 6 cloves instead of 4). I also add 1 tbsp of chilli powder to beef as I cook it for a little extra flavor.  And finally I do not add the kidney bean liquid to the chilli. If you want it a little more watery add more tomato sauce. But I do like this recipe as a starting point, it just needs a little extra to complete it IMO

Honestly, this is the best pot of chili I've ever made. Great, full flavor. I did make two substitutions. Instead of stewed tomatoes I used canned whole plum tomatoes and cut them up. I didn't have any tomato sauce in the house, so I used a can of V-8.

I made this today. Very easy. The only modifications I made were I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, added  cumin, cayenne pepper, green and red bell peppers and ground turkey. I did not measure out my seasonings I just added to my taste. My kids are very fussy but they liked this

After 4 years of trying different recipes, I finally took home our family's "golden ladle" award at our chili cook-off with this chili! It's so simple yet there is nothing that this recipe is lacking. Truly amazing!

Required a bit of modification to thicken up - mixed a couple tablespoons of flour with equal parts cold water, and stirred it into the chilli a little at a time during the simmering. For extra heartiness, I recommend adding sliced mushrooms 10 minutes before the 1-hour simmer time is up; and corn niblets and diced green bell peppers along with the beans.

This recipe was so easy and flavorful! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of only using one onion instead of two because I only had one  on hand.  We topped it with cheese, sour cream, and oyster crackers and I also made some corn muffins. Will definately make this again since everyone loved it.

This was very easy and everyone loved it!  The only change I made was instead of Chili powder i used Cayene and Habanero sauce because i did not have any chili powder.  O and ground turkey instead of beef.   Also cooked it in a crock pot instead of stove.  Turned out fantastic!

good for a large group.
couldn't find stewed tomatoes so used peeled whole tomatoes instead. They needed to be mashed up more.
I also added leftover corn, and meat. It's a basic start to a "everything but the kitchen sink" recipe.

The only things I really changed were adding in my own veggie preferences. If you like green peppers and mushrooms, then those go in with this very well. I also like REALLY spicy stuff, but my kids don't. This recipe was PERFECT for my family because I made the basic chili (with my veggie additions) and the kids LOVED it! At the table I added in more cayenne for me and my husband. 5 stars all around for flavor. We also didn't use beef because we didn't have any on hand so I used ground venison. Still tasted great!

I love this recipe bit I did make some changes. I added 2 cooking peppers I had from the garden. I didn't add the liquid from the beans but did put in  the liquid in from the tomatoes. I didnt  have stewed tomatoes so I used diced ones that where flavors with oregano and rosemary.  I like just  tad more spice so I added a couple shakes of Creole seasoning and a shake of red pepper  ,cumin  cinnamon and a touch of sugar. It came out perfect love it

This is an awesome recipe! The only changes I made were that I added two cans of tomato sauce and to replace the stewed tomatoes I used real tomatoes and diced them. I also didn't have oregano so I used some seasonings instead. I boiled kidney beans instead of using the ones out of a can, to make it more healthy. Also, it's not necessary to heat the chili for an hour before adding the beans.

Like other reviewers, I almost didn't try this because it is too simple...but I was in a hurry and it turned out great!  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes (original) ... only made half a recipe.  I also snipped up about 1 tblsp of dried guajillo peppers (one of the backbone chili peppers for cooking Mexican-style dishes) for depth of flavor.  Also added beans same time I added tomatoes and only cooked for about 20 minutes.  Very simple, very easy and very good!

Great base recipe. It was well enjoyed when I made it exactly as posted, but I've modified it to give it more "kick" and chili flavor. I prefer a slow cooker. In goes Basil, Garlic and Oregano flavored tomatoes instead of plain diced tomatoes. Puree 1 can of chipotle pepper and add that to the party. I add a can of black kidney beans as well as the other ingredients above. Lastly, I brown the beef in a pan, drain the meat into a crock pot, then saute the onions in the beef drippings until they start to soften, drain them then add to the crock with all of the other ingredients. It sits in the slow cooker here for 2-4 hours depending on how long I can wait! The chipotle adds a good amount of smoke flavor and heat, so many might want to start with 1/2 the can, they're small but they bring it!

This is a super simple and easily tweak able chili recipe. I halved the recipe, and chose to use a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes when I discovered we had no stewed tomatoes. I also added a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes for texture. I chose to rinse the kidney beans (one can each of dark and light skinned) for a thicker chili. I followed a other reviewer's advice and added a T of chili powder to the browning meat (and then another 2 T with the rest of the ingredients. I also added a T of Montreal Steak Seasoning, just because I have found I like what it adds to chili. I was a little unsure of the oregano, but it works. THANK YOU, for the recipe!

I made it as written. Was very good. Next time I will add more
chili powder. Not as spicy as we would have liked, need a lot
more heat.

Changed it around a little. I actually used Trader Joes Beefless Beef (1 pkg which equals 1 lb of ground beef) to make this vegetarian. I also used half the tomatoes and tomato sauce, and added fresh bell peppers and a can of black beans, Flavors were great!

Awesome chili recipe!  I have made it several times and have tried to improve upon it each time.  I basically follow the recipe, but I added fresh (diced) red, yellow, green and orange peppers, crushed red peppers (to adjust up level of spicy) and one packet of Lawry's regular chili seasoning.  As it cooks, I check taste and add additional chili powder along with onion and garlic powder as needed.  I don't make it too spicy, but enough to enjoy all the flavors.   For this most recent time, I made it in a slow cooker on low for about 8-10hrs.   My family could not get enough of this chili recipe.  Even my wife's coworkers (who have tried it) have begged her to bring more into work!!

Had this recipe at a friends house.  Decided to try it for myself. Really good basic recipe.  Added in about 1/4 - 1/3 cup of real maple syrup.  Gave it a wonderful mix of spicy and sweet.

All my wife's friends loved it and barely had any left for myself!

Love this starter recipe, I add green and red bell peppers along with cumin, black pepper and Chyanne pepper. I have been making it for years and often make between 5-8 lbs to freeze and space out. I've also substitute ground turkey and it always turns out perfectly!!

I've made this chili a dozen times and it's always great.  I do tweak it sometimes just depending on what I have on hand but and I often make a half recipe.  Such a great base to build off of - thank you!

My family loves this chili.  I usually use diced tomatoes rather than stewed tomatoes, with one can of diced tomatoes with green chilis.  For the tomato sauce, I generally put a can of diced tomatoes in my mini food processor and blend them up.   I also add 2 more cans of beans, usually garbanzo and pinto or black beans, whatever I have on hand.  I don't drain the beans.  I also add a teaspoon or so of cumin.

i was looking for a simple chili recipe, no dramatics. This was perfect. I of course tweaked it a bit: less salt, added cayenne, tbs of Badia Seasoning, used less ground beef. i also used kidney & cannelini beans,  1cup of beef broth. turned out great. Im pairing with Tostidos!

I've made this chili a few times before with a few adjustments and "tweaks" each time..  I like to add an extra can of kidney beans.  I also use two (15 0z) cans of "No Salt Added" Hunt's Stewed Tomatoes + one can of Del Monte "Italian Recipe" (15 0z) and one 15 0z can of the Del Monte Stewed tomatoes with green chiles; instead of just four cans off the same, which really opens up the flavor spectrum, and puts just the right spice on the tip of my tongue.  I Keep the other ingredients the same with the addition of a little more Chili Powder. ( I use Morton & Bassett for their use of "clean" ingredients, and large elbow macaroni.

I made changes...I'm sorry. 
I substituted one of the cans of stewed tomatoes for a can of kidney beans cause I can't get enough beans, man.  That's all though. So 3 cans of stewed tomatoes instead of 4 and 2 cans of beans instead of 1.

Other than that, everything was crazy delicious! I am totally makin' this again the same way cause I love me some beans still. Everybody loved it, it was fun to make. Very little hassle. Made the house smell like a home. It kicked winter's . Go get your beans on people!

Use 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/ green chilis, instead of 4 cans stewed tomatoes. Add more chili powder. This has too much beef, reduce it to less than 1.5lbs. Also reduce onion. Add more chili powder and a can of Great Northern beans for more bean chili.

Simple, easy and quite delightful! This recipe will be going and staying in my recipe book. It was cheap, easy and quick to make and put together. The only thing I will change, is instead of one can of kidney beans. I will do two, wasn't enough in there for me.

This is the only chili recipe I will make. And it is a hit with family and friends. I make it with ground turkey and substitute diced tomatoes for stewed (I find it easier than breaking up the stewed tomatoes). I also substitute Rotel chilis and tomatoes for two of the cans of tomatoes. It gives it a good extra kick. We serve this over Fritos and with shredded cheddar on top. I can't recommend this enough!

I changed the recipe by using 1 can of stewed tomatoes, 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes, and 2 cans of kidney beans.  My mom's opinion is that chili always tastes better the next day and she feels it is because the kidney beans add more flavor as they begin to break down, so I try to imitate that "breaking down" process by mashing half the kidney beans with a fork when I make the chili.   Turned out great!  So simple and the seasonings are perfect!

I like this recipe, especially the consistency of the chili.  I did make a few changes.  I adjusted the spices as follows:
1 TBSP chili powder
1 TBSP Cumim
1 Tsp - smoked paprika
1 bay leaf 

It was a hit with my family, who all have different opinions about chili.

Great recipe, I swapped the cans of stewed tomatoes for crushed tomatoes, just feedback I got from family. tossed some chopped green onions on top with sour cream and some cheddar cheese on top and voila!

Larry liked it but I didn't.  Also, the Chili Powder I used was old and lost a lot of its flavor I think.

The only thing I would do is cut the chili to a. 1 1/2 tablespoon and cut down on the onions; other than that it was delicious.

This chili was really good! I made a few changes, but I usually do. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cocoa, 1 each green, red, jalapeno pepper. This came out one of the best chili recipes I've ever made. I would definitely take it to my next competition.

It would have been great as written, but these are the things I changed: Added only two cans of stewed tomatoes instead of four. Added twice as much chili powder, and only half as much oregano. Threw in a tsp of cumin and a couple dashes of hot sauce (like Tabasco). After the meat & onions browned, I didn't drain (I used lean beef) and I just added all of the rest of it at the same time and cooked on low about an hour. Topped with some shredded cheese and served with hot cornbread. My family loved it!

This is a great, basic (and easy) Chili recipe. Like others I did make a few changes based on what I had in the cupboard and what sized canned goods I buy here in Canada. 1 796 ml can of diced (no salt added)tomatoes; 1 540 ml can of Kidney beans; 1 398 ml can of tomato sauce (no salt added). I upped the Chili powder by 1 Tbsp. and added .5 tsp of Cumin. It's great for those that don't like a 'hot' kind of spicy Chili, like my 14 yr old.

I made this last night and it was phenomenal! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any garlic cloves and it was too cold to run out last night so I used fresh minced garlic(the kind that comes in a glass jar and is kept refrigerated) and it turned out perfectly! I love the simplicity of this recipe. it was so easy to make and tasted great. I will definitely be making this one again!

My family loves this the only changes I made was instead of 4 cans of stewed tomatoes I use 1 stewed and  3 cans of different flavored diced tomatoes, like chili flavor, green pepper & onion,  roasted red pepper, and so on,  it adds flavor.

It was very tasty and easy to make. I made some adjustments by adding a green pepper, corn, and a few mushrooms to make it heartier.

A new family favorite! I like adding an extra can of beans and I generally get the diced tomatoes so I don't have to break them up while cooking, but I've done it as written and it was definitely delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

I normally use Wick Fowler's chili kit, but my store was completely sold out and with Super Bowl Sunday at hand, I had to improvise.  I followed this recipe pretty closely, but embraced the revisions cited by many others and used 3 cans of Mexican seasoned stewed tomatoes, 1 can of Rotel diced tomatoes and chilis (original), doubled the chili powder, added 1 T of ground cumen (a must) and used one can of red kidney beans and 1 can of chili pinto beans (beans drained and rinsed).  I had drained and reserved all the liquid from the tomatoes and added sparingly in light of the many comments about the chili being too watery.  I ended up using almost all the reserved liquid, but will probably only use about 75% next time as I like my chili a little thicker.  Used a little corn starch to thicken up my final batch, served with grated, sharp cheddar cheese (Tillamook, of course!) and Zesta saltines.  As far as how it turned out, I will just say if you put a bowl of this chili on top of your head, your tongue will slap your brains out trying to get to it.

This was my first stab at chili and I love this recipe. It was very easy and left enough room to add your own flavor and spices. I added a pinch of salt, A little more chili powder and some cumin to taste. Can't wait to make this again and again!

This is a great recipe to start with.  Thought it was too runny so I added tomato paste to thicken it.  I didn't like the idea of the oregano, so I omitted it.  I added some cumin and cayenne pepper to give it some zing.  I also used both ground beef and hot Italian poultry sausage.

So simple and fast that it's not even worthwhile to take out the slow cooker for this. I use tomatoes with chilies and it creates the perfect amount of heat.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

Grandma, husband and preschooler loved it.  It's was a great easy recipe. I did make a couple changes. I did 1 pound beef and 1 pound ground turkey. 1 of the tomatoes we used a can of dived tomatoes with red chiles/ chipotle. Finally we did 2 cans of chili beans  and reduced the chili powder because of it. We eat a lot of chili and my husband is usually in charge. This was the first one I've made in a long time. Good easy recipe!

This is a very delicious recipe! I adjusted the serving size to four and used one can of chili hot beans, one can of kidney beans, and one can of red beans. Also, I added a can of green chilies.  The rest was the same as the recipe said once adjusted to the new serving size. Definitely will make time and time again! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

Like others, I added more chili powder, brown sugar, and cocoa powder - all to taste. I also added some steak (cubed) with the ground beef. Yummy

This was a GREAT base recipe for chili! It was my first time ever making chili, and with this adding some jalapenos and seasoning my ground beef a little differently, I was able to come out with a GREAT chili.  

Great JOB!

I absolutely love this recipe. I did change a few things, I added a can of Bush's chili beans with the juice (I did not use the kidney bean juice, but I did use the kidney beans). Two, I left out the oregano. Three, I used bloomers chili powder and used 3 1/2 tbsp. Instead of 2 tbsp. The flavor is just outstanding and I will continue to use this recipe. Thanks for helping a clueless chili maker make the best chili in Louisville. :)

Great starter recipe......I did tweak it some....I used 2 cans of Bushes Chili beans (liquid and all),  I put in 2 cans of diced tomatoes with the green chiles ( I think they are Delmontes), 1 can of diced tomatoes, and a can of tomato sauce.........  next time I make I think I will add a little more chili powder and maybe just a small can of the green chili's to the mix........  all in all happy with way it turned out

I used this as a base recipe. The result after the tweaks were five star. Ground beef is expensive, so I used 1lb vs. 2. I did not use dried oregano and I only used one onion.        I added: 
   *one chopped green pepper
   *3 cut carrots
   *3 chopped sticks of celery
   *black pepper to taste
   *cumin to taste. 
I used 2 cans of black beans in place of the kidney beans.
For the tomato sauce and stewed tomato, I only had 6 frozen medium sized garden tomatoes because that's all I had. To thicken it a bit, I sifted some all-purpose flour into it while stirring until the desired thickness was reached. Turned out great!

This recipe was great.  I took advice from some of the other reviews.  I used 3 cans of petite diced tomatoes and 2 cans of mild rotel. I added some heat because we like the spice.  I also added a pinch of Cumin. Fantastic and will make it again.

so this recipe is delicious. this is almost exactly how I make my homemade chili so I decide to use this recipe and give it a slight makeover. Instead of using ground beef and kidney beans, I used Johnsonville Mild Italian sausage and chili beans and man oh man is it amazing! I think the sausage gave it an extra bit of kick because it has so many other flavors to offer!

Always miss my mom's chili but she doesn't have an exact recipe and I could never replicate it. This is the closest I've come and even my husband loved it. I did add cumin because it doesn't seem like chili to me without it, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This one's a keeper!

I don't normally come back on this site to rant about recipes I found here, but this recipe is the bomb!!  Like others I do put my own spin on it, I put an extra tbs of chili powder and throw in a can of spicy chili beans as well as a few twists of Rachel Ray Chili Seasonings.  Even my 24 year old son called back home and asked for this recipe.  Thanks!

I was shocked to find this recipe since this is almost identical to my Grandma's chili recipe.  The only additions: 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp paprika, and 1 diced jalepeno (seeded).  I cook the jalepeno with the onion, garlic and meat.  Also,  I like to use 2 cans of tomato paste instead of 1 can of tomato sauce and add more kidney beans to thicken it a bit.  I've made it on the stove and in the crockpot (4 hours on low) and both come out delicious!  This chili freezes GREAT!

I only used 1/2 chopped onion and 1 tsp of minced garlic b/c we do not like a strong onion or garlic taste. I used 2 cans for stewed tomatoes instead of 4, also. This came out perfect. I will definitely use this recipe again. We ate it with corn chips and shredded cheese and it was yummy!

This is always my go to chili recipe! However, I do add more veggies (celery, onion, bell pepper) than it calls for. I also add a LOT more chili powder. It's a great base recipe, though. :) I usually cook the meat and combine everything in a crock pot. SO good if you let it cook all night through the next day.

Very good recipe, however, I did use 2 cans of beans, substituted oregano for basil b/c I was out . My biggest meal critics are my boys and they thought it was amazing, which pleases me:). Also, I later found out hubby slipped in some jalapeños.

First I added a couple of the last veggies from the garden (a bell pepper and jalapeño ). Then I messed up and accidentally  bought diced tomatoes instead of stewed so I only added 3 cans.  Because of this....mine did not turn out quite as expected. My husband still rated it as 4/5, and I look forward to making it as written next time! So I apologize to the original writer because it deserves 5/5. I promise I will re-review. I appreciate this site and have been so pleased with the recipes I have tried. This one is staying in my recipe box for sure!

Thank you for this recipe but we couldn't eat it. It was way to tomato and strong. Tasted more like spaghetti sauce with beans. Yucky. But again, thank you. :)

this is a good, basic chili recipe, I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed as I do not like the chunky texture of stewed tomatoes.

Nice chili recipe. I made a few adjustments to suit our taste. Subbed 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies for 2 cans of the stewed tomatoes, added an extra can of kidney beans, added an additional tablespoon of chili powder and also decided to throw in a 1 1/2 teaspoons of cumin because I LOVE cumin. Really good!

I'd always used a packaged chili mix in the past (I know, I know...gasp!)and am so glad to have found this easy and tasty recipe for my husband. He really enjoyed the oregano addition, and because he likes his chili with some bite, I also added some crushed red pepper flakes. I didn't have any tomato sauce around so I added about a cup and a half of original V8 juice instead. It was a hit.

I had to cut this recipe in half, but it still made a lot of chili. But it was perfect!! So delicious. The only tweaks I made besides cutting it in half was, I added one can of kidney beans, and took another can, poured in another bowl and mashed them, then added it. Also about 30 mins before I added 1/4 tsp of baking powder to take some of the tomato acidity away. But overall, it's a simple recipe and seriously delicious!

This is almost exactly the way I make mine, which I just did. I add diced sweet and hot peppers and some "Better than bouillon " beef paste and splash red wine.

That critical review that uses cinnamon and cocoa in their chili has no clue how to make chili.
People don't realize the chief ingredient in chili powder is cumin.

My husband loved this and he hates tomatoes and beans. I added extra chili powder, about an extra tbs of chili powder, a can of corn, added the beans early and only cooked it for about an hour total.

Super easy, quick and tasty!  This recipe is defiantly a keeper. I switched the beef for 1lb ground turkey and 1lb sweet turkey sausage with the casings removed.  I also added some spices, 1T cumin and 1/2tsp cayenne. I had pintos on hand that I had cooked earlier in the week so I used about 3 cups in place of the canned beans.  I served this with chopped white onion, shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream and the whole family ate it up.

What a hit! I have a turkey chili recipe that is very similar with lots more ingredients which of course results in more flavors in the mouth but it also takes more time and labor to create. This was a great weeknight, post work, rainy day recipe....got home at 6 had on the table by 7:30 with some cornbread! I made the recipe as is except I added a couple tablespoons of sugar to cut the acid. Family loved it, will be making again for sure and will keep playing with the recipe. Thanks!

Follow up: Tonight I used two cans of fire roasted pepper and chiles diced tomato sauce and then 2 cans of normal dice toms in sauce and it was so divine! we topped with mozzarella cheese and it was like it had a Mexican flare with it. We made cornbread but next time will be the Mexican cornbread on the site with cheese and peppers...Mmmmmmm

This is a good base recipe, but chili is a very individual dish. It seems like there are as many recipes as there are chili cooks. I gleaned modifications from other reviews and made these changes: used chopped stew meat because I don't like ground beef in chili; used 2 cans Mexican style stewed tomatoes and 2 cans diced tomatoes with green chilis; added 1 tsp cumin (chili really needs cumin), and reduced oregano to 1 tsp. I sauteed the onion and garlic with vegetable oil in a skillet, added the meat to brown, then put everything in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours. Great chili!

Pretty good, but agree with other reviews that it doesn't need all that salt. I don't like kidney beans, so I used one can of black beans and one can of pinto beans instead. I also used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce to help thicken it up a little. Also added a little diced celery. Hearty and perfect for this snowy MN evening!

We tried this recipe yesterday and we loved it. We did alter it slightly using 3 cans of stewed tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes with chilies, instead of the called for 4 cans of stewed tomatoes. This gives it a very slight kick, but not much. Just remember to top it off with some grated sharp cheddar cheese? Delicious indeed.

by far my fave "basic" chili recipe....I make some tweaks to this- I drain & rinse the canned beans before adding. I double the chili powder & beans (I use 1/2 black beans/ 1/2 kidney), plus add a whole diced green pepper & omit the added salt (if you're using canned tomatoes & canned beans there's already a ton of sodium there.)

This is a great starter recipe. My first time making it, I spiced it up with twice the oregano, garlic, and chili powder. Plus I added some Sichuan pepper, pepper flakes, and cumin. It is pretty good.

This was a great chili especially for my husband. I personally do not like big chunks of tomatoes In my chili. I added some chili beans and some chili ready tomatoes and it brought out the flavor very nicely.

I added 1 1/2 more tablespoons chili powder and one can diced green chilis.  I also added about a teaspoon of sugar.  Great base for a chili recipe.  It is better the next day!

It's a hit in my house!!!  My husband just said, "this is the best chili you have EVER made!"  We've been married over 20 years!!  I don't usually do recipe reviews, but I could not let this one get by.  I did tweak it a little though.  I used the ingredients stated here, but I substituted once can of the tomatoes for a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, then I used a packet of chili seasoning and a can of chili without beans.  I just finished making it about an hour ago, and the pot is almost gone.  Well, let me go get my bowl before it disappears.  Thanks for sharing.

This was my first attempt at making chili and it was such a hit!  My boyfriend said it's the best chili he ever had and I think it's the best I've had too.  We both love spicy.  I'm not an allrecipe.com purist so I do take the reviewers modifications into account when I try a new recipe.  So here is what I did differently:
1.  Used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, drained one of them first.
2.  Used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and drained both.
3.  I used 1 lb of ground beef and one pound of steak (it was on sale!)
4.  I added a small can of crushed chilis, some red pepper flakes and about 3tsp of hot sauce.

It turned out great.   This is a wonderful base recipe!!

Good basic chili. Not the kind of chili for super bowl party with bold & spicy flavors, but perfect for cold winter day while watching a movie kind of chili :-)

I like this as a base to start but I made a lot of tweaks including not as much salt and lots chili seasoning and hot sauce with crushed red peppers. Chili should be in my opinion spicy not sweet or salty would make a good spaghetti sauce tho with out the salt.

I added a green bell pepper and some black beans just because I like those in chili and a little chile pepper paste for a spicy kick, but otherwise kept this recipe as recommended and I think it's the best chili I've ever had!!

This is the first time I've tried to make chili and it was a success!!! What an awesome recipe. The only thing I did was add a tablespoon of dried basil and it was incredible. The whole family including my picky-eater 4 ur old loved it.

This is a great base recipe.  I would add my own recipe, but am not much of a measurer, and cook by taste.  I cook onion, garlic, bell pepper and jalapeno in some EVOO, then add the meat.  Drain.  Then I add in the chili powder, some oregano/rosemary, cumin, nutmeg, cinnamon.  The  I add my tomatoes, I sub diced for stewed and still use the can of sauce, then add brown sugar, cocoa, and add coffee to thin out a little.  Serve with onions, cheese and fritos.  Family loves it and devours it!

This was my first time making chili and it was an amazing base recipe! I added 2 cans of beans instead, some celery, 1 can of tomato paste, and 1 package of chili seasoning (like old el paso), and it tasted amazing. My boyfriend loved it and I make it all the time for him now. I sometimes top it with grated cheese and serve it with tortilla chips or bread. So good, so easy and cheap to make! Thank you :)

Just like everyone else, we loved it! Two families with different taste preferences and everyone agreed!  I substituted ground turkey and tomatoes with chilies (2 of 4 cans) and extra beans and it was perfect if you like just a touch of heat to spice things up.

(We always use just one tablespoon of chili powder for our taste preference.)

I added some cumin and dropped the amount of oregano, since my opinion is that oregano is best placed in Italian dishes.  It definitely could have been spicier, but it was a good consistency and I enjoyed the texture.

I made this chili today and took many of the reviews into consideration. I was very happy with it and it was perfect for a fall day.  I made mine in the crockpot but ended up having to use 2 and splitting the mixture in half. I browned the ground beef with the onions and garlic on the stove and then added it to the mixture of tomatoes and beans that were already in the crockpot. 
Crockpot- 2 cans stewed tomatoes, 2 cans diced tomatoes, 2 cans chili beans 1 can kidney beans, 14 oz tomato sauce, 2 tables tomato paste 2 tsp oregano, 3 tbls chili powder, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, salt, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tbls brown sugar, I let this cook in The crockpot on low for 4 hrs. I ended up adding about 3/4 c of water because it wasn't soupy enough. It was very tasty! I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is very close to the chili I grew up with. We always added macaroni to ours, but I tried it without for this recipe. I did add a small can of tomato paste to thicken it up a bit, and also added a little more chili powder, a tsp. of cocoa powder, and a tsp of cumin. I serve this with corn chips, sour cream, and cheddar cheese. Made "Golden Sweet Cornbread" recipe to make this a hearty, fall camping supper.

It's pretty good! This was the first chili recipe I have ever made or eaten. From reviews I did tweak a bit, I halfed the recipe and used one can of stewed tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes with chilies in it, I also browned the meat with onion and garlic and then added the cooked meat and rest of ingredients into a crock pot on low for about 3 hours, turned out nicely! Next time I would add more spices, maybe cumin powder and tomato paste to make more thick

This is a delicious recipe and so easy!  However, I did make a few changes to suit my taste, but used the base as a starter.  For my tweaks, I left out the beans because I just don't like them in chili.  I also don't like onions, but I knew it needed something for the flavor so I used dehydrated minced onion instead.  I added a can of diced green chiles and a little more chili powder for some extra heat.  Lastly, I used TVP (textured vegetable protein) in place of the ground beef, and a little canola oil to make up for losing the fat from the meat.  This came out a little "soupy" which is just the way I love my chili!  Who needs a spice packet full of preservatives and ingredients you can't pronounce when you can make it from scratch so quickly and easily.  Thank you for sharing!

made this recipe tonight.I don't usually make chili, this was easy and  surprisingly  tasty. the whole family  liked it and we have some  opinionated  members. I  tried the previous suggestion of substituting  succeed tomatoes  with green chili  for  two of the stewed tomatoes.  it added flavor. I also only used ground  Turkey, no beef.

Easy recipe, good base for chili, but I added cumin, chili powder, cayenne, red pepper flakes, definitely made it better, but a good place to start for chili :D

First time making chili and this recipe was perfect - and easy!  The reviews were very helpful and I incorporated some of their suggestions, like adding in diced tomatoes, tomato paste, more beans, and using additional spices like cumin, cocoa, etc. Thank you Michelle for posting the recipe.

Just made this! Did not do onions. Substituted the kidney beans for Bush's chili beans and used tomato paste instead of stewed tomatoes. Also, used garlic powder instead of Clove garlic. Added salt and pepper and water to thin it. It's delicious!!!! My boyfriend loves it!!!

I reduced it to four servings and used ground turkey. With those measurements I used a whole can of kidney beans and one can diced tomatoes  and added 1/2 teaspoon of chili flakes. Was perfect with the additions !

Haven't made chili in quite awhile so I needed a new recipe & this was a great pick!  I've made a few changes after reading some reviews....I used 2 can's of petite diced tomatoes & 2 cans of stewed tomatoes.  Added 2 cans of Bush's Chili Beans instead of 1 can.  Only added 1 tsp. of salt instead of 2 because I'm always cautious about salt in recipe's and you can always add more. Next time I will probably leave out stewed tomatoes all together because I'm really not that crazy about them & just add the petite diced, maybe even cut 1 can out so the chili will be more on the thicker side?  Overall as others have said this is a great base recipe & easy enough to tweak & make to your own specifications over time!  This one is now in my recipe box...thanks!

Made as is this recipe is pretty bland, more like beefy tomato sauce than chili. If you look at the other reviews most people had to kick it up in terms of spice. That's what's off about the rating system. If you're not rating the recipe as it's written, the rating doesn't help much. I think this could be a 5-star chili but it definitely needs some tweaking. On the plus side, very easy to prepare and doesn't take long to make.

This was great!  My roommates liked it as much as I did.  I had to stew my own tomatoes, but otherwise, I stuck to the recipe.  I did add a bit of black pepper for bite.  I baked homemade cornbread to complement the chili.  Yum!

This is the second chili recipe I've used from this website, I couldn't find the first one I used which was really good. It was really hot and my husband LOVES hot food so, I was a little reluctant at first, being that it wasn't my original recipe. When I was done, of course, my husband didn't really care for it because it wasn't hot but his mother absolutely LOVED it! We had hot dogs and fries for dinner and used this recipe for the chili and mustard on the hotdog and I took a bite of it and instantly felt like I was back in NY on coney island eating a nancy dog! My mother in law says she's been looking for a good hot dog chili and finally found it!

This is a great base recipe.  You can easily tweak it to your taste as far as spices go.  I doubled the amount of chili powder and added almost the same amount of cumin.  I also added a half a can more beans and it turned out great.

I love how simple this chili recipe is, and how flavorful it is when it all comes together! I did not have fresh jalepenos so I threw in a small can of chopped jalepenos. The heat was definitely there but tolerant, omit or put in half if you don't like it hot. I also added 2 cans of beans rather than one. The author of the recipe suggests using home-canned tomatoes and I can't agree more. I actually FREEZE tomatoes from my garden and added them in--delicious! I will be making this again and again!

Bland.  Chili must have cumin and I prefer a spicy chili.  I salvaged it by adding more chili powder, cumin, cayenne and chopped chipotle peppers. Not a bad base, but needs more flavor.

This was my first attempt ever at making chili.  I did follow a couple reviews with some changes....I used 2 cans of beans, i had some other types of tomatoes on hand so used a mix of types, and I added about 1/3 a green pepper.  It was a big hit!  I had my boyfriend and my parents over for dinner and they all loved it! Mom was worried I was going to make her work harder on her chili after having this one. (even though it's not a hard chili to make.)  I'm a big fan, and will be making this more this winter!

This was a huge hit. I usually follow the instructions the first time I cook a new recipe and then tweak it the next time. This time I added 1 can of mild Rotel Tomatoes instead of 1 of the cans of stewed tomatoes. I browned the ground beef with the onion and garlic and threw it into my slow cooker. Then I mixed the remaining ingredients including the kidney beans in with the meat. I turned the slow cooker on high for about 5 hours.  I thought the consistency was perfect and the flavoring superb.  I served the chili on a bed of rice and topped it with shredded cheddar cheese.  This recipe is definitely a keeper but I'll continue to make it this way.

I made a few modifications to this recipe, however, I find that the recipe is fairly bland in flavouring (I even added more and other spices too). The recipe is very good, but I suggest those who want to try it to be creative with it (I find it makes for a great base). I made it in the slow cooker for about 5 hours, it tasted good, my husb says that it's "too tomatoe-y" haha. I meant to add a jalapeno pepper in it... should be good then. ;)

I also made a couple of modifications, like using fire-roasted diced tomatoes, two cans of bush's chili beans and an extra can of kidney beans.  I also added a seeded jalapeno before letting everything simmer.  I also used extra chili powder, extra garlic (I like a lot), and added some garlic powder at the end. I didn't use the oregano ... should I have?  I think adding a little brown sugar is a good idea.  Will try that next time.  I will make this recipe again, maybe next time with ground turkey.

This chili was really good and super easy.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I only had diced tomatoes on hand and used some with green chilies and used dry beans(cooked separately).

Quick and easy! This is a "basic" recipe that you can tailor to your own taste. I tripled the chili powder and added 1 small sliced jalapeno pepper and 1 green pepper while simmering. Top w/sour cream, shredded cheese! The crowds love it!!!

This is a great chili base recipe. I added my own favorite things but having this as a base made it my favorite chili so far. Thanks for sharing!

I like this chili recipe.  It was a little sweet though and I'm not sure if it is something I did, or if Chili is typically this sweet. I did use one can of chili beans instead of the kidney beans and one can of rotel in place of one can of tomatoes. It is a very good recipe and I will be making this again!

This is a great, easy chili recipe.  I added cumin and used 2 small cans of tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce to make it thicker.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

Wonderful recipe!!! Made it the first time along to the directions and it's delicious. The next time I customized it (as is the spirit of chili making lol) now I make it with diced tomatoes w/ chili peppers and ranch style beans as I prefer pintos in chili. And I added an extra can of beans. Love me so beans!!!! Thanks for the great recipe!!! Oh yeah and I added some serannos for heat. Can't forget that

I must have made a hundred chili recipes over the years looking for one just like this, simple and so tasty!!! Most chili recipe's have way to many ingredients. Just as it is is so good, but easy to tweak like adding a little cumin or a couple chopped peppers. Very Good !!!

Thank you, this is very good. I didn't have canned tomatoes so I used beef bouillon and tomato paste. Will sure to make it again, either with bouillon or canned tomatoes.

I made this as my first time attempt of making chili, and it was a huge hit! I did add and extra can of kidney beans, and a little extra chilli powder, but other than that I followed the recipie as made, and it turned out fantastic. I serveed with biscuts and for the kids I put it over some macaroni. This will definetly be a keeper in our house!

My husband and I LOVE this chili!  I make it about every other week during the winter.  It's even better the second and third days because the flavors meld together so well!  I cut back on the ground beef and use petite diced tomatoes instead.  I also use 4-5 cans of kidney beans for extra fiber and protein.  I drain and rinse the beans prior to putting them in the chili.  It's also best to let the chili simmer for a couple of hours--the beans get so tender!!  YUMMO!! Great recipe--thanks for posting!!

Very good basic chili recipe and extremely easy to make. I made some minor modifications:

1 chopped habanero pepper.
Instead of 4 cans of stewed tomatoes I used 2 and 2 cans of diced (one with green peppers and one with jalapeno).
Used 1 red onion and 1 yellow onion.
Used 8 garlic cloves instead of 4.
Added fresh ground pepper, some marjoram and some thyme.
I also added some olive oil at the beginning to brown the beef etc.
Topped with grated medium cheddar and a little sour cream.

I suggest you serve this with a good cornbread (not the cheap cornbread muffin mix) and top that with butter and honey. Reheated leftovers the next day tasted even better. Thanks for the recipe Michelle.

I love this chili recipe! It's easy in its preparation and ingredients, and totally full of flavor! I added more chili powder and salt and pepper to taste. I also followed other reviewers and out of the 4 cans of stewed tomatoes, I substituted 1 with diced tomatoes and chili peppers. I prefer my chili with more beans, so I added a second can of kidney beans. Five minutes before serving, I added 2 chopped green bell peppers for some crunch. I top my chili with shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Everyone loved this recipe - as adhered to the original, but even more when doctored up a bit :)

Very seldom do I change a recipe on the first round (I always follow exactly, then change if I feel necessary), but I also never serve a new recipe to others before I try it first.  This was an unusual time, so I changed a little.  


I loved this recipe out of the ones I saw on this site.  I doubled the recipe and added 4 jalapenos (1 with the seeds , but I would add 2 whole jalapeno next time with all the seeds).  I made the chili powder heeping tablespoons and I added 1 green pepper.  Dash of pepper. 


This turned out wonderful.  Many people at the chili cookoff I took it to, told me this was the best spiced chili there.  I didn't make the cutoff for the contest because I was late, but it was almost gone before we left.  Definately, a make over and over recipe.

This was just what I was looking for -- a good basic chili recipe.  Tastes great and is what I expect good chili to taste like.  And if in the mood for something a bit different, this is perfect for adding other ingredients.  I had to really up the chili powder when I made this to get it spicy enough for us.  But it was the brand of chili powder I bought.  Won't be buying that one again -- too mild for us.

Great Chili!  I had never made chili before.  I did cut out one can of tomato sauce and added a bit of paprika.  Use a potato masher to crush the tomatoes easier.  I searved it with sour cream, green onions, shredded cheddar cheese, and cornbread twists.  I quadrupled the recipe and cooked it in a nesco for my daughters first birthday party.  There was none left!

Excellent - so easy and so tasty. I made it with ground turkey as that was on sale, and it didn't compromise the taste at all.  Served it with fat free sour cream - a hearty dinner for cold winter nights.

This recipe was good, but a simple addition to the recipe made it a hit at our house. I added a jar of medium salsa. It was just the "kick" needed!

This is a great basic chili recipie, if you change it a little. I used 1 lb. ground beef, only 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes, and added celery and green pepper. It's the best basic recipie i've used yet. I like that it's not very spicy. This makes a lot of chili. Still looking for the "perfect chili" recipie.

This was a little soupy as is.  Next time, I will add some cumin and probably not add the tomato sauce.  It didn't really do anything for it.

normally i prefer spicy chili but found this recipe to be very good as is. the only changes i made were in using ground buffalo (what was on hand) & doubling the kidney beans (personal preference). we really loved the rich, full flavor & slow burn. thank you michelle!

This was a very good basic chili that can easily be augmented with additional ingredients (corn niblets, chopped jalapenos and some hot sauce came to mind as we chowed down).  Next time, I plan to use one less can of tomatoes (it was a little soupy) and perhaps 6 cloves of garlic instead of 4 and an extra tablespoon of chili powder(the recipe could use a little extra spice).  We topped with shredded cheddar, chopped black olives and a dollop of sour cream to dress it up a bit!  Went great with "Golden Sweet Cornbread."

Great, easy recipe.  I made a few changes though...I used the suggestion of 1 can less stewed tomatoes, added some water.  Also added cumin and cajun seasonings and probably doubled the amt of chili powder but it still wasn't enough.  I also put chicken and polish sausage into my chili instead of ground beef.  A bit too tomato-ey last night but it's perfect today!  My friends loved it.

Delicious! Just traditional chili and that is what I love! I only put in 2 onions as my husband isn't fond of them. I added some tabasco and a little extra chili powder to make it a little more spicy. This is the first time I have ever made chili. It was so easy and so good! Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent!! Just what I was looking for in a chili recipe.  Very simple to make, you only have to cut up the onions and garlic and then after that it is just a matter of adding the canned goods and stirring it. Thanks so much for this fantastic recipe, I normally hate cooking, but found this extremely simple and something I plan to make again!!

SUPER!!! I am a vegetarian and I replaced the ground beef with Boca's soy ground beef.  I used just 3 cans of onion seasoned diced tomatoes, added one can of water, a package of chili seasoning, and 3 cans of kidney beans. I also added the beans 30 minutes after the mixture simmered and then cooked the entire mixture for 30 more minutes.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.

This was a wonderful, basic chili recipe.  After reading other's reviews, I cut the tomatoes down to 3 cans and used petite diced instead of stewed.  I only used one onion (and may even cut down on that the next time) and two cans of drained kidney beans.  I like mine spicy so I added some hot sauce at the end.  It was excellent, and I served it with cheddar cheese on top.  Made a wonderful dish and a nice dip with corn chips.  Thank you for this recipe.

This was a good base for chili, but we had to add a lot of spice to it to get it how we liked it. We added a packet of chili seasoning, worcestershire, garlic salt, red pepper flakes, and extra chili powder. Very good.

Just the thing after a brisk walk in the winter!  (Even in Florida!)  Thanks, this really is simple and extremely tasty.  We ate it with a little fresh cornbread and sour cream.  It's a great base to start experimenting, too.  My boyfriend added about 2 tsp of cocoa powder, which I think melded the flavors together even more.

For our family, this recipe would have made too much.  So I followed the advice in a previous review and cut the meat and spices in half but still used full cans of tomatoes, sauce, and beans.  It came out really good, and we served it over rice with Golden Sweet Cornbread on the side.  Next time, I will not cut the spices in half, just the meat, because it could have used a little more flavor.  But I agree that it is a wonderful base recipe that everyone should try and then add their own touches to.

I think this recipe is delicious!!! My whole family loves it, I can never make enough! I add potatos and corn to mine and I add them and the kidney beans in step 2. After it cooks for an hour, I uncover it and  let it simmer for another 20 minutes. Thanks for such an easy recipe!!!

This is a great recipe.  I liked it because you could really make it your own...by following other raters' suggestions.  I hadded a packet of chili seasoning, some Emerils Essence, some frozen home grown tomatoes, some extra stewed tomatoes...it came out great.  I think it definitely needed more juice, tomatoes, something...to make not as thick.  Just my preference!  Make this one and play.  Served with homesteader cornbread as suggested.

I had to change a couple of items because of what was on hand.  I used 1 can of 28 oz tomato sauce and only 3 cans of stewed tomatoes plus 2 packs of chili seasoning.  It turned out great!  Thanks Michelle.

Very good chili.  Even though I like a "thinner" chili, this was a little too thin for me at the beginning; it came around, though, after adding tomato paste, brown sugar and a couple of shakes of Worcestershire.  I'd also cut the requested salt in half and adjust at the end.

I made this with a few changes because I wanted to make a lot of chili yet I didn't have a lot of meat in the house.  I doubled the recipe but substituted about 19 oz of mild italian sausage (out of the casing) for some of the beef.  It came out excellent!  I also added some cumin and less oregano for personal preferance.  This got rave reviews and is a wonderful basic chili recipe you can tweak and personalize.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was excellent and my family loved it too!!  It was perfect for a cold, snowy night.  I made a few changes: used 3 cans of stewed tomatoes and 2 cans of kidney beans; I also added more chili than called for, just my preference.  Serve it with hot cornbread (Homesteader Cornbread recipe is great!) and you have yourself a wonderful meal.  Thx Michelle.

Really good, and simple to make.  I changed this around and used 1 lb ground beef, and 1lb spicy italian sausage.  Then I used 2 cans of Mexican style stewed tomatoes, and 2 cans of the Chili Ready diced tomatoes.  My only complaint is that it is not spicy enough!!

This was a really good basic recipe for chili. My whole family enjoyed it and ate it with no problems. I put the stewed tomatoes that I used in my food processor first so that my children wouldn't pick out the tomato chunks. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Nice, easy chili recipe but nothing I would consider spectacular.  Everyone enjoyed it but no one raved over it.  I used tomatoes with green chilis to spice it up a bit and that helps.  I will keep as a reserve when I want something easy but will keep searching for THE chili recipe.

This chili is amazing.  My whole family loves it.  The best thing about this chili is that you can cook it and eat it right away- it tastes like it's been cooked all day!  Nothing fancy about the recipe- which makes it the best.

I made this recipe with ground turkey instead of beef to cut down on the fat and calories but maybe that's why I don't think it's soooo great. The consistency is also too thin. I will make it with beef next time and hopefully it will be better.

My family and friends loved it!  I added an extra can of kidney beans (without the liquid) and pureed the tomatoes since I don't like huge chunks.  We will definitely use this recipe again!  Thanks!

We don't really like ground beef, so we switched to 2 lbs of shredded chicken and made the rest the same.  It is delicious!!  We love this recipes.  We first tried it with ground beef, and we really liked it that way too (except for the fact that we don't like ground beef!).  It's one of my husband's favorite recipes.

This is a good basic recipe. It was well liked by some of my male relatives because it doesn't have any "weird" ingredients. I added another can of beans, diced green pepper, and some of my Tastefully Simple Wahoo Chili blend. I thought the chili was easy and excellent!

Very, very good.  I use Italian stewed tomatoes for a little extra flavor and add an extra can of beans.  My husband loves it and doesn't even want me to try any other recipes.

The best and easiest chili I've ever made.  I made some changes: only 1 T. on chili powder, 2 t. cumin, 1 clove of garlic, 3 cans tomatoes (pureed--my kids won't eat chunks), 2 cans of mexican chili beans.  Very flavorful, but not too spicy for my children (boys, ages 4 and 7).

Love this chili.  I use more garlic.  I also use one can of pinto beans and one can of black beans because we don't like kidney beans that well.  I usually add more chili powder to taste, also.  It's even better the next day!

recipe was a great chili starter.  i did make some adjustments by adding 1/2 bottle of beer.  i also used 1 can of diced tomatoes flavored with garlic and olive oil,1 can stewed tomatoes, italian style, 1 can paste, roasted garlic, 1 can hunts seasoned diced tomatoes sauce for chili and 1 t. sugar to cut the acid with all the tomatoe products. chili turned out great.  i had the chili powder and hot sauce in the table, but no one used it.  actually made chili mac and had bowls of additional chopped onion, shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream on table. thanks for the great chili starter!!

This was yummy - added an extra can of beans without the liquid, a green pepper, and three cans of stewed tomatoes. Delicious, basic recipe. Freezes well.

This recipe was awesome and soooo simple to make!!  I'll definitely use this from now on instead of the chili kits I usually get from the grocery store.  Things I did differently:  used 2 cans of stewed tomato instead of 4, blended the tomatoes since we don't like chunks, added a green pepper, used 3 tablespoons chili powder instead of 2, added about 1 teaspoon of cumin, and I added some cayenne pepper for some kick.

This was a great recipe to use as a starting point.  I changed sone things based on other reviews: 2 cans tomatoes not 4, 2 cans of beans not 1, and 4T chili powder not 2.  I also added a dash or two of an extreme hot sauce.

Flavor is perfect. One thing I would prefer next time is if there was less beef and more sauce. It was a bit too thick for me to go back for seconds.  But, because that is easy enough to change, I gave the recipe five stars. Some might also like to add more beans. In order to get it really spicy, I suggest to put some of the cayenne chili into the stewed tomatoes and the tomato sauce and let it sit for a while before adding them to the beef. I did that and it came out so surprisingly hot.

This was a great chili for my young sons. Not spicy at all. My husband likes it way more spicy. So when making it for him, I add more chili pepper, hot salsa and red pepper.

GREAT! I'm not a big fan of stewed tomatoes, so I used 1 can stewed, 2 cans diced, and 2 cans of sauce. I couldn't believe how fast this recipe was and it was even better the next day!

This is a pretty good recipe that can be adjusted to individual taste. I substituted  ground turkey for 1/2 of the ground beef. This makes it easier to justify for those who are watching our fat intake.

This chili is really, really good.  I used 1 tsp. garlic powder instead of actual garlic and I used 2 cans of kidney beans with liquid instead of 1 can.  Like I said, this is a really good chili recipe, definately hits the spot with everyone on a chilly fall or winter day!!  Thanks for the recipe, Michelle!!  Definately my new chili recipe!!
