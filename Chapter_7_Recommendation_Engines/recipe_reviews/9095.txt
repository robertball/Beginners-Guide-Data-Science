I just made this recipe yesterday for my family's Thanksgiving and it was a complete embarassment! I have made a different corn pudding recipe every year for the last 3 years and I tried this one because it sounded like it would be easier, but it was not. The butter separated everything and it turned out all runny and not good at all. I will stick to my old recipe and do not recommend this to anyone.

My family loved this recipe and it's very easy to make. I plan on making this more often than just Thanksgiving.

This pudding did not cook in 45 minutes.  It was still very thin in a 3 inch square out of the middle.  I cook it in a 9X9 dish so if I had used a larger dish it may have cooked correctly.  I wasn't completely disappointed in the flavor although it is very sweet.  The custard  stuck to the bottom of the pan around the edges.  I made this for New Year's Day dinner and no one was really enthused with it.

The best corn pudding recipe for fresh or frozen corn. I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and it was still very sweet.

This turned out delicious!  I had to keep it in the oven much longer than the recipe indicated (closer to 1.5 hours) in order for it to actually brown and firm slightly.  In the end it turned out yummy and my family enjoyed it for Thanksgiving.

The cooking time was about 55 minutes, to be firm in the middle and golden brown on top. I used 1/4 cup of butter, and it was still very oily. Wonderful flavor. It just isn't what I think of as "corn pudding." This was very eggy with a souffle-like texture. It just melts in your mouth.  Awesome flavor, but the mouth-feel was weird. I won't make it again.

Our chickens are laying lots of eggs so I tried this recipe to use some up.  It turned out really well.  I misread the recipe and used two 10 oz bags of supersweet corn.  I reduced the butter to 2 tablespoons and the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Baked in an 8.5 by 11 inch casserole, it took far longer than 45 minutes, maybe 1.25 hours.  Turned out as a creamy custard over a corn base and was plenty sweet enough for my husband and me.  The corn was a little watery on the bottom but fine.  Will make for company and holidays.

The butter seperated and there was a solid layer of thick white"cream" on the top and liquid on the bottom.

I cut the recipe in half.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and baked for 55 minutes.  It was a little moister than a lot of corn puddings I have tried.  It was a little bland too.   It was easy to make though.

I would make it again, my family loved it, they had many helpings. The only complaint I had was the consistency it's a little more runny than I would prefer but, still tasted delicious.
