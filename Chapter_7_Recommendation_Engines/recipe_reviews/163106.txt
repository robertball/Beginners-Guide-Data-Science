Meh it was o.k. 10 minutes is definitely way to long to try to brown the almonds they burn a lot faster than that.

I loved the flavors in this dish. My husband and I are on opposite shifts so we don't get to eat together but he called me on his lunch break to tell me how good it was. I served this with a spinach rice casserole and steamed asparagus.

Awesome! My 10 year old and 9 year old loved this. We will definitely make it again! I did not toast the almonds according to the recipe but put them in the oven for a couple of minutes. Other than that I didn't change a thing! Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! The crispy almonds are the best part. I didn't have enough parmesan cheese so I added a little Feta.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I toasted my almonds in the oven while it was preheating by spreading them dry in my baking pan. They were a rich golden color within minutes with no added fat. I used my own homemade vinaigrette with its light raspberry flavor. All the flavors blended beautifully. Simple to prepare and elegant to serve. Thanks for a great recipe.

Good but a little bland. It definately needs something else to add more flavor. I may try it again and figure out what to add.
