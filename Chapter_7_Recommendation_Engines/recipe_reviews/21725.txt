My Mother used to make a variation of this recipe that she called "Bohemian Spaghetti."  This recipe uses garlic and other herbs, which I think give it a certain flair.  However, these ingrediants don't seem to be 'to scale.'  I suggest using a little leftover bacon grease to cook the onions in, and possibly an extra can of broken up stewed tomatoes (if you cook it the way its listed, it will be very dry.) Also, I heat the pasta after its mixed for a few minutes (while stirring) so that it absorbs all of the flavor.  (The way I make it has it turn out a little greasy, but the flavor more than makes up for it.)

I was looking for a recipe with stuff I had at home as I didn't feel like going to the store. I entered pasta, tomato, cheese and bacon in ingredients and this recipe came up. I'm glad it did! It was really good. It true that it looks dry at first but it is perfect when you mix it with the pastas. 
After reading the reviews I did this: I put in 7 slices of bacon which I cut in 1 inch slices before cooking them. After removing the bacon, I cooked the onions and garlic in the bacon fat. Since I didn't have a can of tomatoes, I used 3 fresh tomatoes,removed the skin and diced them. I don't like parmesan cheese so I put in 1/2 cup of mozzarella which I mixed in with the pastas and sauce before serving. I used rotini pastas. I will make it the same way again and have a bowl of freshly grated parmesan cheese available for those who like it. This is now a favorite. Thanks Catherine.

Yes!  Pasta just as it should be!  Lightly dressed, not buried in heavy, overly-spiced, thick, pasty sauce! (Gross) I loved this, with its few fresh, simple flavors and ingredients.  Since I made only a few ounces of pasta for the two of us, I didn't open up a can of tomatoes. Rather, I used a few red ripe, Campari tomatoes, fresh parsley, and the herb seasonings to taste – and a little olive oil.

very easy, just the right blend of spices.  It looked a little dry while cooking.  however, it turned out great.  Not enough for four of my friends.  Make More!

This is a great alternative to the regular spaghetti sauce.  Make sure you use a good cut of bacon to get that great smokie flavor. I really enjoyed it and it was a great way to use some of the fresh herbs from my garden.

Love this! My 3 year old loved it too. I added some more stewed tomatoes because it looked like it needed more. In the end it would have been fine with the original amount-but it still turned out great. I added some leftover hamburger too.

My family really liked this.  It was very tasty and I will definitely make it again.  I used the already cooked bacon so it was a quick and easy meal.

This is going to become my new favorite pasta dish! It is sooo simple to make and I usually always have these ingredients on hand. It's also very quick to make so coming home from a long day of work to cook this meal was not too tiring. I didn't change much, I just used the bacon grease to took the onion in and I also doubled the recipe and this was enough to feed two young men and myself with a little left over.

loved this! it did look kinda dry and pale when i tossed the pasta in but turned out to be very very flavorful. very minor alteration i made was i didn't remove the sauce from heat when i tossed in the pasta. then i mixed in the cheese to let it melt with the pasta. that way, the cheese kinda coated the pasta and made it more flavorful. yummy! i will definitely make this again.

My husband didn't expect to like this but he really did.  It wasn't very saucy, but over all really tasty.  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed.

I like discovering new variations on the traditional way to make spaghetti, and this tasty recipe fills the bill.  It's easy to make and uses simple ingredients I happened to have on hand.  I doubled the recipe to make sure it adequately fed my hungry husband and son, and there was plenty to feed the three of us plus leftovers.  I used 8 slices of bacon (I had previously divided up a 3-pound package into freezer bags), and I didn't drain off the grease, as it helped to make the recipe more flavorful. I sauteed the onion and garlic in the grease and then added the tomatoes and cooked bacon.  I simply crumbled the bacon into the sauce rather than breaking it into 1/2" pieces.  I also used diced, rather than stewed, tomatoes because that's what I had in the cupboard, and they provided nice bits of color.

This is pretty good, but I think it needs a bit stronger of flavor.  Next time I would add more spices.

Made this for dinner tonight. It was good, but needs a little more pick me up. I cooked the onions and garlic in the bacon fat and added some garlic and onion salt but it still needed something.
I'm not into to spicy foods, but I'm sure my husband would have added some pepper flakes to the sauce. 
I served it with a veggie and garlic bread.

I have to say that my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by this pasta dish.  I followed the directions for the most part.  I used some cilantro and italian seasonings in place of parsley (did not have) and added some sliced olives.  Like some other people have mentioned, these are common ingredients in the house.  Overall, great dish and hope you like it as well.

What a nice change from sausage or hamburger red sauce! The whole family liked it. Made no changes except increased  the amounts of everything except the tomato sauce. Cheese topping is a necessity for flavour, I used Italian cheese blend.

When I make this dish I add some hot pepper flakes! My family loves the extra kick with the light sauce! Definitely worth trying the addition if you want some more flavor and don't mind a little kick!

Liked this!I was out of spaghetti so I used rotini and I think the bigger noodles held up the rest of the ingredients well. 
I took the advice of other reviewers and chopped the bacon first then poured off the fat halfway through cooking. I pored off the rest before cooking the onions, just leaving a little fat in the pan. 
My family wasn't quite ready for dinner so I made a blend of three cheeses (cheddar, mozzarella and parmesan) with some Panko for a topping then baked it for 15 minutes while I was waiting. Very good! I'll make this again.

we couldnt eat it. and I didnt know you could ruin bacon and cheese but this did.I think it could very well be the worst meal I have ever made. so I thought maybe I could eat the bacon out of it. nope. then I thought maybe I could eat the pasta with melted cheese on it but nope. then I thought I could just eat the melted cheese with corn chips. but no way. it was just bad all the way through and I really wished I had made bacon lettuce and tomato sandwiches silly me

I used fresh tomatoes because I didn't have stewed (makes a difference in the flavor, stewed is what you should use), and a red onion. I was looking for the bacon-tomato flavor, and something quick to cook. It was quite good for that. The smokier the bacon, the better the flavor. The cheese adds some saltiness. The sauce is good, lighter than traditional bolgnese. The broken bacon pieces could be added at the end with the cheese.

Just made this for dinner. So easy to cook. 
My fiancé loved it and asked me to put it down on our good recipes list. He wants to have it again. :-)
