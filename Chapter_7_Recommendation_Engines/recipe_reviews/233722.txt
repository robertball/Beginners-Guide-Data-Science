We really like this recipe but it was missi g something... so we added diced jalapenos! I think this would be great without ground beef and just as a beer cheese dip too! Will be trying this again!

I made the queso sauce then added in leftover taco-seasoned meat from the day before. I did not try this myself but my husband and kids inhaled it along with a whole huge bag of tortilla chips.

Yummy queso dip I made with leftover taco meat. In the future I'll use more if not all cheddar cheese. It was a wonderful texture and came together nicely thanks for sharing.

Made this for a neighborhood party. Substituted ground turkey for ground beef. Very easy to make & very good.

Somewhat bland. Came together easily but definitely needs some spice and flavor boost.
