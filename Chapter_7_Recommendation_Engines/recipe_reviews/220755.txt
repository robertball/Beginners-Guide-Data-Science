Amazing.  I microwaved the rutabaga probably for 6 minutes and used a parmesan/mozarella grated cheese mix.  I also skipped the egg, since we were out, but it worked out fine!  I'm holding myself back from licking the skillet.  Reminds me of cauliflower in a cheese sauce, but better.

Even my husband liked it!! I mashed it with the beaters though. It tasted like cheesy cauliflower soup. I used 2% milk instead of whipping cream. Much better than I expected!

This was delicious! I cit the cream in half and used two per cent milk to make up the amount. Other than that, exactly as written. Wonderful recipe!

First time eating rutabaga and it was fantastic! Never knew how good this vegetable was! The sauce is pretty rich, I didn't need half of it on my plate alone, LOL. I thought it had a good flavor profile and my wife ate her entire half, albeit stuffed!

I will say it  was different.  It was a great change to possible boring. Easy
