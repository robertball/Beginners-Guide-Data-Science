I've been making these for year but never thought to use avocado oil. I loved the flavor it added. I typically add some chili powder to the oil and will do that next time. 5 stars for the avocado oil!

I made them! I used canola oil and cooked them in the air fryer, I put them on a paper towel to get the grease off and sprinkled with Carne Asada seasoning that I read from a tortilla soup recipe, they were amazing, My husband even said I could stop buying tortilla chips at the store and just make these. Thatâ€™s probably not gonna happen.

I loved these. The avocado oil is a great oil to use for tortillas!
