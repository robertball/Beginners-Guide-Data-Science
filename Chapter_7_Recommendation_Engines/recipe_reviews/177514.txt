This recipe is a good start to mexify standard chili.  To finish the job, I used two cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of the salsa to kick up the heat, added the juice of a few limes, and garnished with chopped cilantro and a dollop of sour cream.  Yum.

This was great and really easy and fast to make.  Next time I may try adding some diced tomatoes since the salsa I used didn't have any tomato chunks.

Good weeknight standby.  Didn't like the smell of the turkey, so next time I'm going to brown the turkey separately, drain and keep aside; saute onions and real crushed garlic, then add the turkey and the rest of the ingredients.

Love this! I made a few minor changes to accomodate our tastes:  used fresh garlic instead of powder, upped the amount of cumin, and doubled the amount of chicken broth. Instead of salsa, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes w/ green chilis and 1 can of chili-ready tomatoes. Very good served with a little shredded cheese and dollop of sour cream. Thank you!

Recipe was good but I added 1 8oz can of tomato paste and 1 12oz can of enchilada sauce. I served over top corn chips with sour cream and sharp cheddar cheese.

Loved it! I used cooked black beans (don't care much for canned veggies), and frozen veggies (green beans, corn, peas, and carrots). Just delicious, and very healthy!

This was a great base to start with! I used what was on hand and it was fantastic. I used ground chuck in place of turkey. Upped the black pepper to 1 tsp. and the garlic to 1 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. cayenne and 1 tsp. paprika (we like more kick!). Added an additional can of beans (pintos) and a can of diced tomatoes. Instead of sugar, I added about 1/3 c. ketchup at the end: adds a touch of sweetness and helps thicken it up a bit. I also did mine in the slow cooker for about 6 hours after browning the meat and caramelizing the onions. I think this is my new chili recipe! Thanks, Campbell's!

This is delicious!  I changed it up a little bit.  I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes and a can of enchilada sauce.  I also added some extra corn and black bean salsa and used kidney beans instead of black beans.  I used cayenne instead of chili powder and it gave just the perfect kick.  I also added a little more salsa and reduced sodium chicken broth than what it called for.  I didn't add sugar, but the cumin gave it a little bit of a sweet flavor, so I'm glad I omitted the sugar.

I loved this. I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of salsa and reduced the broth by 1/4 c (use what you got) and had pinto beans instead of black beans. It was great with some garlic bread!

A new staple at our house!  My husband and our 7-year-old and I all love the wonderful taste!  (I use mild or medium salsa when our son will be eating this with us).  We like to sprinkle some grated cheddar cheese on top.  Will have to try the diced tomatoes idea, too...

Swanson Black Bean, Corn & Turkey Chili Haiku: "I'm sorry, Swanson. This was 'dressed-up' taco meat. Needs alot more stuff." Not a bad chili, persay, but well, it did smell and taste like glorified taco meat, b/c the chili was lacking in more beans, veggies, and tomatoes. The only changes that I had to make were using a different brand of salsa, and fresh garlic instead of powder, but I followed the recipe exactly and just found it to be nothing remarkable, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Just made me ponder that if I were to make it again, I definitely add another can of beans and a can of diced tomatoes.

This was great! made it up a day ahead of time (thickens it up and more flavorful)- I omitted the oregano (didn't seem to need it) and used a can of Bush's seasoned black beans and used honey instead of sugar-yum!

I loved this recipe!!! The leftovers did not last long at my house. I modified it a little by adding chopped fresh jalapeño and a little Tabasco for some kick. I served with some sweet cornbread!Overall a wonder dish that will definitely become a staple.

My family loves this chili.  The only things I changed was I bought low sodium broth, salsa, beans, and corn.  DH has high blood pressure and I try to cut sodium where I can.  The flavors are still awesome.

This chili was ok... nothing special about it. It didnt quite reduce down to a saucy consistency as I like but I would make it again if i had all the ingredients on hand.

Like this recipe. The corn and black beans add a different tex ture than red beans. My only concern was that I was unable to find Pace Thick &Chunky and had to use another brand. If I can't find it next time, I won't use the substitute salsa again.

Easy and delicious! Didn't have chicken broth, so I used vegetable instead. Still turned out great! Also added 1 can diced tomatoes with chilies and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper.

I do substitute 1 tsp of Chicken Low Sodium "Better than Bouillion" paste in the same (or just a little less) amount of warm water as listed for the canned Chicken Broth which is (1 3/4 cups)  Often I use less water, if it seems the other items have already released enough liquid, particularly if the turkey had been frozen & was thawed just prior to making this dish. Other substitutions, if I don't happen to have Salsa on hand... then I use some cut fresh tomatoes, or one could use some dices tomatoes with green chilies. I have made this recipe & given it away MANY Times. It's a wonderful Go-To recipe on a chilly night or when we just get a hankering for it! Love it, it's easy & quick.
I too have used Herdez 10 can of Mild Salsa (already had Herdez on hand). Plus I see that others have used the BtB too, & heated their water for a bit in the microwave to help the paste blend better!

I had a pound of ground turkey I needed to use up and found this recipe on your site and decided to try it.  It was very tasty and so easy to make.  It was ready in no time.  Did not make any changes, but dh said it could have used a little more heat, so maybe next time I will add some hot sauce or red pepper flakes.

Very easy to make and very tasty.  I never made chili before (but have eaten it many times) and this is right up there with my favorites. It's a staple now.

This is a GREAT recipe- easy and delicious. I add additional chili power, cayenne pepper, red peppers and green chilies for a hotter flavor. This also freezes nicely for about a month, so you can cook a larger pot.

I used Hot Reindeer sausage and beef instead of turkey. I upped the spices by 1/4 t. all around (except salt and pepper). Added in tomato paste. It was a good balance for my husband and I's taste buds between spicy spicy and regular spice.  Oh and we topped with sour cream...next time I will remember the green onions.

This chili has so much flavor and is so easy to make!  I was a little short on chili powder so I added some extra salsa and cumin to make up on the flavor.  I was tempted to add other things as per the comments from others but I usually like to stick to the recipe the first time around.  No need to add anything extra, wonderful. The fact that ground turkey is used is a plus, always so light and less calories than gr beef. Added bonus, I was able to use organic blk beans.

my friends and family LOVE this chili. Its the only kind I make now. I like to add bacon and black olives plus I up the amounts of all the spices because we like it kind of spicy. I also use the canned black beans with jalepeno which also adds a nice kick. I brought this to a potluck at work and now my co-workers are constantly begging me to make it and bring in to the office. We love it!

Good recipe.  It had fewer ingredients than other chili recipes I was finding.  Easy to make.  It has a bit of spice, but I made my own chili powder with Cayenne. I also added some fire roasted canned tomatoes since my wife had some.  Great when topped with fat free cheddar and fat free sour cream!  Also sprayed wheat torillas with olive oil and baked and served with chili
