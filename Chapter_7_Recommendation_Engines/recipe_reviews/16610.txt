I, too, have made this for years.  I like cheddar cheese better than Swiss and I use a small can (2.8 oz) of fried onion rings (not 6 oz. as listed).  Also, I add about 1/4 cup milk with sour cream to keep casserole from getting too sticky.  Also, always make sure veggies are thawed or they don't get done.

I took everyone's advice.. waited to veggies to defrost and added 1/4 cup milk. I used pre-shredded mexican style cheese rather than swiss or cheddar. Everyone loves it! It's easy too. I can make it the night before and refrigerate it then put in in the oven for 30 while I'm making other dishes.

This is really fast if you remember to thaw the veggies out ahead of time (first time I forgot!).  Another thing that I found handy was to mix everything together in the crock pot, and put it on low.  It frees me up to do other things around the house, or run a few small errands, and still have a wonderful veggie dish for supper.

I have been making this for years. You can also make it with cheddar cheese soup, sharp cheddar cheese and omit the fried onions - kids seem to like it better. On the orginial version I also add
a can of sliced mushrooms, drained. Low fat soups and sour cream work just as well as the high fat kind - just not as rich tasting.

Good stuff.  I got asked for the recipe when I took this to the Christmas party.  I used Monterary Jack and Cheddar cheese and added a 1/4 C of milk to the sour cream like suggested.  It turned out great.  I also bought the Cheddar Cheese French-fried onions, and I think that made it extra good.

I made this to bring to Easter dinner at my in-laws. I used a pre-shredded mix of Monterey Jack and chedder cheeses instead of swiss. I don't cook very often..this was very easy for me..the in-laws were impressed and loved it..there were no leftovers.

I use this recipe for almost every family gathering.  It has become more popular than the Green Bean Casserole Recipe.  Also, try this with Monterey Jack Cheese instead of Swiss or Cheddar.  It is much more milder and the flavors of the vegetables really come thru.

Very good.  I used frozen veggies and steamed first, made the sauce and refrigerated until just before time to go to a potluck.  As others, used shredded colby-Jack cheese.  Before adding the sauce sprinkled steamed, drained veggies with Mrs. Dash seasoning for extra flavor.  Did not have the onion rings and just sprinkled extra cheese on top.  No doubt the onion rings would add even more flavor and texture.  Will try that next time.  Thanks for an easy, quick and different vegetable dish.

My family thought this dish was great.  It is hard to get everyone to eat vegetables and this one definitely does that.  I can't wait to bring it to a potluck as I am sure it will go over well.  The only thing I did differently was put buttery crushed crackers on top instead of the onions - since I didn't have the onions on hand.

I made the recipe "as is." I didn't think it had much of a taste. My family thought it was good, so I gave it 3 stars. I wasn't very impressed with it. Sorry to give a disappointing review. I'm sure if I make it again it can be altered to be fantastic. It has a lot of potential.

I've made this recipe for a lot of people, and have only had one person not care for it.  It is a favorite of mine though.  I use a different bag of mixed veggies each time.

Great way to fix veggies!  I made this for Thanksgiving as a change from green bean casserole.  Love the swiss cheese.

My family loved this recipe!!  I added Cheddar Cheese, Fried Onions and Sour Cream like the other lady and it was awesome.  The vegetables we liked the best were broccoli, green beans, cauliflower, mushrooms and onions.  But you can use anything. Thanks for sharing!!

I switched out the mushroom soup for celery and the swiss cheese for cheddar - it was awesome!  My husband hates mushrooms and swiss, but this recipe adapted well.  I served it at Chirstmas dinner - it was a huge hit!

I've made this recipe many times, its really easy for a good veg. dish that isn't just plain vegies.
I also add some onions and fresh mushrooms to the california blend of frozen vegies I use and I double the recipe and bake it in a 13x9x2 so there are leftovers for another night.

We all enjoyed this recipe.  A nice change from the standard veggies.  I also used a stronger cheese and substituted chopped onion for the frenchfried onions.

Excellent recipe although I forgot to reserve some cheese for the top. And I reduced the sour cream by half only because that's all I had.  However, in future I will keep to the reduced amount as I don't see the need for more.  The flavor was great. It makes serves a lot more than the 5 the recipe states. Will be using this recipe again.

Very good but to much sour cream for us with the cheese and cream to rich, I think i will try again with half as much. My husband loves the greenbean casserol that is on the fried onion container we have that often so this is something new, thank you for the recipe.

I thought this was okay, but nobody else liked it.  It was pretty bland.  I added the 1/4 cup milk per other suggestions and used mexican blend cheddar.  It needs something else to give it a little more flavor and it would be really good.

LOVE this recipe. I always use cream of chicken soup, a mix of velveeta and mild cheddar and a little milk and it's always a huge hit. I don't even like broccoli or cauliflower but I always go back for seconds on this!

Wonderful recipe. Didn't have the french onion rings or mushroom soup on hand so I substituted bread crumbs and condensed chicken soup and it still turned out fantastic.

Yummy !! I used the California mix veggies with cauliflower, broccoli and carrots and I used reduced fat Swiss cheese (put in a little extra, couldn't resist ;) and low fat sour cream. I only used about half the 6 oz can of onions. I made it for New Years Day dinner and everyone loved it! I definitely plan on making it again. Oh and it's easy! That makes it even better :)

Love this stuff. Have been making it for 20+ years I always get asked for the recipe. They used to print it on the Durkee / now French's fried onion containers. They really need to go back to listing it along with the famous Green Bean Casserole recipe. Well worth it =)

i made 2x the amount. started off just making it as a side but it smelled so good cooking that I ate it for the main dish!   I used one bag of mixed veg (corn, baby carrots, and asparagus tips) and another bag of broc, cauliflower, and carrots... DELISH!

I always have rave reviews for this.  I use the frozen mix of carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower.  I also add a small jar of pimientos, drained, and a small can of diced water chestnuts.  I think these add a lot--color and crunch.  I always get asked for the recipe!!

Huge hit at the party.  The only thing that was changed was the amount of onion rings used - I reduced the amount required.

This was a perfect side dish to take to any sort of family function or buffet style get together.  My whole family loved it (young and old) and I was so glad I left an extra dish at home!  Definitely a crowd-pleaser.
One little suggestion - I added a bit of mayo and 1 egg.

This was really good...I used one 16-oz. package of cauliflower and the same size package of broccoli florets. I think I used more cheese too, because we love Swiss cheese. It turned out awesome! Thanks!!!   Erin

A friend made this for Christmas dinner, and EVERYONE loved it.  It provides that "homey" flavor that you look for at family gatherings.  I highly recommend it.  It is easy to make for any size gathering.

So simple and so good. This is the dish I've been 'assinged' to bring for every family gathering (Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas). I usually use mozzarella cheese instead of swiss, as that's what my family prefers. This is a big hit at our house!!!!

Made according to recipe but it was just too cheesy for our taste(the cheese totally disguised the veggies) and yes, I was aware that I was using Swiss cheese.  lol Will make again sans the cheese  and I believe it will taste better.

Maybe it was because I used low fat sour cream and low fat/low sodium cream of mushroom soup? I found this tasted not much like anything. Oh well...won't be making this again.

I love this recipe! I make it almost every week for my roommates and boyfriend. As a student, this recipe is quick and easy to prepare. You can pop it in the oven and have a meal or side dish. Even though it has no meat, my boyfriend and his friends rave about it!

This is a family favorite!  I use the California medley of broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.  If you cannot find shredded Swiss cheese, I have substitued mozzarella.  It is a milder flavor. I brought this to my best friend's house for Easter a few years ago and everyone loved it so much that I'm asked to bring it every year now!

This turned out to be just ok. Nothing to rave about even after following suggestions. Too much saucy stuff. For a really good casserole I much prefer Aunt Millie's broccoli casserole on the site.

I used this recipe and it came out great! It came out really good, I kept picking on the vegetable mix, the only problem, my family didn’t come until several hours after I finished the dish and it was not as great as it was right out of the oven, but it was still good.

I made this for a cookout we had over the weekend. Everyone loved it. They are all big veggie eaters. I had to make a couple of subs because of what i had on hand. I only had a few slices of swiss, so when I mixed it up I used some grated parmesian in the mix with a little garlic powder. Then I layed the swiss slices on top to melt down over the vegetables. It was very good. I plan on making it for a Mothers Day gathering this weekend. It's a nice change for a veggie dish. Thanks for posting!

This was REALLY GOOD.  I used a frozen bag of broccoli, corn, and red peppers as the veggies (I'm not big on cooked carrots).  Next time I think I will add a little crushed garlic.  This was so good that my two roommates and I ATE IT ALL in one sitting.  You've got to try this, it's really good.

Great way to eat your veggies!  I doubled the recipe and it served a dozen people.  My little 7-year niece loved it.  I used one can each of mushroom and broccoli soup but probably won't use the can of broccoli again as it overpowered the flavour of the other veggies.  I used mozzarella instead of the swiss.  Couldn't find the French-fried onions but will look harder for them next time I make this dish.

My family and I found this dish to "sticky".  I might try again with less sour cream and thinning out the mushroom soup
I couldn't get my kids to try it.

Quick and easy to make.  I'd not use Swiss cheese again...doesn't lend a good aroma to the dish when heated. Maybe mozzarella or something mild like that. Use a mild sour cream as well.  Great idea and combination...just needs some personal adjustments to suit one's individual preferences.

I love Monterey Jack cheese, it melts so good, so I use that

instead of swiss. Other than that everyone LOVES this casserole!  I bring it everywhere.

I made this recipe for our work Christmas potluck. I doubled the recipe, and added garlic and onion powder and cooked it in the crock pot on high for 3 1/2 hours. Delish!!! Next time I will add mushrooms just for something extra.

Easy and yummy.  Perfect for something fast.  I think I will try to use Greek Yogurt next time to cut down on some of the cheese.

I have made this recipe for years and the crowd loves it.  Making it as presented creates a VERY RICH recipe. In fact, most people feel guilty about eating it and while they love the blend of flavors they think they may have a heart attack.
Seriously, it is that rich!
Here's the remedy for a wonderful side dish that folks can relax and enjoy. It's so simple too! Double the veggies! The sauce is so rich, there's plenty to go around and you can even feel good about eating your veggies. Everyone can relax :D Oh and by the way, I often use a blend of fresh and frozen veggies. The bags of frozen are super convenient but the quality can vary and I tend to buy store brands which are not always great so I go with some fresh as well.

This was a five star recipe with a few additions....a little milk to thin out the sauce, fresh garlic, season salt, regular salt, pepper, 1 jar pimentos, cheddar cheese instead of swiss, and mixing some fried onions into the veggies as well as sprinkling them on top. I used a California blend for the veggies and 2 cans of green beans.

The casserole looks nice, smells good and bakes firmly, but it's a lot of sauce and the vegetables are overwhelmed by it.

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly and found that the flavors of the Swiss cheese and onions complemented each other perfectly. Changing the cheese will completely change the flavor of the dish but cheddar would probably be great too.

made this for easter and it went over ok.  Its pretty good right out of the oven but when it cools not so much.  I kept it in the crockpot to keep warm.  I may make it again but not for a gathering.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving. So good and I even enjoy the leftovers (if there are any) and I'm not a leftover person. The only variation I would suggest is using cheddar cheese instead of the swiss. Yum!

For me this constitutes a main dish, but I think it'd go great with baked chicken.  I liked how easy it was to put together, but cook time was a little longer.  This is nice enough to try on people that aren't your family.

It was okay.  Definitely needed more salt and cheese, as well as longer cooking time than stated.  It was a little watery and bland.
