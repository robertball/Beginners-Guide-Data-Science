I had made this on Saturday, did not soften the zucchini as directed but saute
them with the onions and garlic, added fresh sliced mushrooms, transferred to baking dish, layering as I did this and
sprinkled on Parmesan Cheese, 3 slices of
Julianne Swiss Cheese, and Mozzerella cheese with a 1/3 jar of Bertolli mushroom spagetti sauce with Merlot.  It was just enough and it was just right.  If you let it set after baking like lasagna it will absorb the water from the
sauce.  Also I had sprinkle bread crumbs on the top before baking.  Will be making
this again and again.  Very good.   Thank
you. forgot I had also added fresh basil 
from the garden.

Great recipe!
I noticed when I sauteed the zucchini instead of boiling it, that it didn't turn out watery at all.
I added extra garlic, sliced roma tomatoes and mushrooms - all sauteed in addition to the onions. It turned out fantastic.
I also used Ragu Garden Style Spaghetti sauce. Perfect!

This recipe was delicious although I made a few changes to suit my family's tastes.  I grilled the zucchini on my George Foreman Fusion Grill.  I salted the slices liberally and it pulled out a lot of moisture.  After I removed them I let them cool and then patted them with paper towel to remove as much extra moisture as possible.  (It worked).  I used a jar of spaghetti sauce, fresh mushrooms, onions and a little wine for flavor.  I also used a pound of ground turkey, cooked and drained it and mixed with the sauce along with 5 cloves of fresh garlic.  I used mozz cheese, ricotta and parmesan.  My hubby who is somewhat fussy told me that he would eat this again and again.  Hence the 5 stars.  It was a great starting point and if I were going to make it purely vegetarian I would add grated carrots and celery and maybe summer squash.  But it really is worth a try.

I thought this turned out great. My husband enjoyed it as well. I did not boil the zucchini. Instead I sauteed it with the onion and garlic until the onion was tender. I also did not use thin slices of zucchini. I prefered larger slices. I recommend using  a chunky spaghetti sauce. I used mozzerella and parm and I baked it at 375 until the cheese was brown. It was a little watery but the zucchini was not mushy at all.

Very easy & delicious. What more could you ask for? I added sautéed mushrooms, fresh sliced tomatoes & a bit of mozzarella cheese to the layers. I baked it at 375 for 30 min. I will absolutely make this dish again. Thanks!

After reading reviews about the dish being watery, I salted my zucchini for a half hour to remove the moisture. I also threw it in with the onion and garlic. As I poured the sauce (Bertolli Tomato & Basil) over the zucchini mixture that is when I realized that it was going to be the sauce that was going to make it watery. I was right...maybe adding tomato paste to thicken it? Besides that it was very good and I served it over ziti.

I used leftover grilled zucchini to make this, and it turned out delicious! A nice alternative to eggplant. We used the leftovers from this dish to make sandwiches on Italian bread the next day. Yummy!

This has been one of my favorite recipes since childhood. My meat loving family used it as a side dish, but I like it best with whole grain pasta and crusty garlic bread for a complete and filling meal.

This recipe is sooo easy and delicious.
I didn't have enough  spaghetti sauce, which was a good thing since the recipe turned out to be a bit watery.
I doubled the garlic, added sausage & parmesan.  Yummy, I'm definitely going to make this again.

I loved this, and so did my guests! I did tweak it a bit - sliced the zucchini into a bowl and drizzled olive oil then coated with parmesan cheese. Broiled the zucchini on a baking sheet for a few minutes before layering it with a sauce made  of crushed tomato, basil, garlic, and onions and sprinkles of mozzarella.

I think it is interesting that a recipe called "zucchini parmesan" actually does not have parmesan in the recipe...anyway...like the previous reviewer, I added sliced sauted mushrooms and mixed them with the sauted onion and garlic into the sauce. I also used sliced mozzarella and assembled it in layers as if I were to assemble lasagna. Of course I also added parmesan, too. I liked that it didn't call for breading and frying the zuchini first...saving time and calories. Very tasty and a great way to use up all the zuchini I have from my garden.

Wonderful over pasta! Followed other suggestions and sauteed the zucchini with the onions and garlic, then baked the zucchini with tomatoes, pasta sauce, mozzarella and parmesan. Delicious!

This was VERY good!  I pretty much followed the recipe as directed.  Only deviated by sautéing the zucchini, onion & garlic.  In the baking dish (used 13X9), I started with one layer of the veggies, followed by some shredded fresh parmesan cheese and mozzarella, then half the sauce.  Second layer with veggies followed by some parmesan cheese, some shreds of fresh basil, the sauce then mozzarella on the top.  Baked as directed – then let it sit for about 15 mins out of the oven.  Served over wheat linguine with a side salad.  It was yummy!

This is so good and easy to whip up. I just put the zucchini, onion and garlic in the baking dish and toss with oil. Cover with sauce and cheese and cook until bubbling and melted. Make it a meal with a green salad and some garlic bread.

awesome...but I made it differently, following others advice. I sauted garlic, onion, green pepper, and zucchini, drained excess liquid off and then baked in speghetti sauce with mozzarella. Very good. even my young kids enjoyed it.

This was easy and delicious. I sauteed the onions, garlic, and zukes together with a little crushed red pepper, green pepper and basil from the garden. I also broiled it  little at the end to brown the cheese a bit. Don't forget to sprinkle some romano or parmesan on top if you like it. Will definitely make again.

I layered zucchini with breadcrumbs, sauce, and then cheese until I filled an 8x8 pan. I covered it with foil while cooking since I did not precook the zucchini. This was an easy dish. I even ate the leftovers mixed with penne noodles the next day.

This is quick and easy to make.  I saved myself a step by sauteing the zucchini with the onions and garlic until tender.  As far as taste, it really comes down to the type of spaghetti sauce that you choose to use.

I grilled the zucchini as other reviewers suggested to make it less watery and added abundant cheese. It tasted liked eggplant parmesan! My young daughter helped to slice the zucchini so the slices were thicker than I would like, but still very good!

I'm not totally in love with this dish but I did really like it. I knew before cooking this that it would be watery. So I first sauteed the tomatoes and then drained it. Sauteed the onions, minced garlic, mushrooms, fresh basil leaves, and zucchini. Drained that and mixed all the sauteed vegetables in a pot along with the Bertolli Tomato and Basil sauce and the already cooked and drained ground beef. Cooked that for a few minutes and then placed it in a baking dish. Topped that with 1 lb of mozzarella cheese and sprinkled some parmesan cheese on that. Baked it til the cheese melted and once that happened, I broiled it to make the cheese more crisp like. The family loved it more than I did so this is definitely a keeper. Will probably make a few other changes if/when I make this again. Thanks for the recipe :)

This dish was absolutely delicious! I read the reviews and made some changes just as suggested. I cut the zucchinis lengthwise added some salt and let stand for 20 minutes, then rinsed and pat dried with paper towel, this is very important because it will eliminate all the liquid from the zucchinis. Then I baked the zucchinis for 10 minutes each side at 450 degrees. Once the zucchinis are ready, I reduced the oven to 325 degrees and started combining everything just as on the recipe with some Parmesan besides the mozzarella. It turned out excellent; I will definitely make this again.

As is it's 3 star. With a few changes it's 5 star. My version of this, roast or grill zucchini, add spices ,then layer and bake. 
Keep the zucchini from being watery , keep them out of water. You also retain flavor by roasting or grilling. I also use garlic and Italian spice. Sometimes mix eggplant and zucchini. Can also add a layer of meat or chicken.

This is really good and simple. My only complaint is that the family likes it some much I haven't been allowed to try any other recipes with the zucchini from my garden. I read the other reviews and I sauted my zucchini with the onion, not so much for flavor but it was one less pot to wash haha. Other variations I have tried which tasted good is I chopped some fresh basil and added it before sprinkling on the cheese and I have also sauted mushrooms with the onion, garlic and zucchini.

Everyone in my family really liked this, especially my husband. Like many reviewers I sauted the zucchini with the onion. I used tongs to remove the zucchini and a slotted spoon the rest of the veggies, in order to avoid excess moisture. I added finally diced carrots to the saute and a little feta to the cheese and baked at 350 for 30 minutes, allowing it to set for 10 minutes after soak up extra juices. It wasn't sloppy or runny at all, just perfect! It's the perfect recipe to use up left over mozzarella or pasta sauce.

I loved it.  I sauteed everything at once in the pan together.  It was delicious.  My husband didn't like it though because he's a vegetable hater!!!  He doesn't know what he's missing!

Great vegetarian recipe - I agree with a couple of the other reviews. You should saute the zucchini with the onion and garlic. This way it's not mushy & has a little crunch to it. I used Ragu super chunky mushroom sauce and baked it at 375 for 30 minutes

This was great considering how easy it was.  I had this massive 5lb zucchini to use up, and this was a great way to use it.  Like others I definitely didn't boil the zucchini.  I sliced it into medium sized steaks and fried them on the frying pan until brown.  Despite not being breaded, it still tasted like it was.  Also I used jarred marinara sauce, but I'm going to try this one again with homemade sauce.

This recipie is really good.  The only thing I did different was after you sauté your veggies add the spaghetti sauce to the frying pan and stir well.  Cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes, then add cheese to the top, recover and continue to cook until cheese melts.  It saves on time and dishes!

This is SO good! I changed the process just a bit to make it faster. I tossed the sliced zucchini in olive oil, salt, pepper, dried onion pieces and garlic powder. Placed them in a baking dish, covered with marinara and mozzarella and baked until tender-crisp. Really a simple idea and SO good! Next time I think I would serve this with a simple chicken breast. Thanks!

Being on a low carb diet, this was such an awesome recipe to curb my "pasta" craving.  Instead of boiling the zucchini, I sauteed it with the onion and garlic.  Then, I made layers of the zucchini mix, spaghetti sauce, and mozzarella cheese to mimic a lasagna dish.  Delicious!

I didn't cook the Zucchini I just sauteed them in the olive oil,garlic,onion and then put them in the oven until the sauce was bubbly and put the cheese on for the last 5 minutes until it was malted and it was soooooo good.The Zuchini were just right and not too soft.We will have this definately more often!!!!

I had something similar at a potluck over the weekend except it had pork sausage in it. It was simply delicious. It looked as though she may have used tomato soup though instead of spaghetti sauce. Now I'm looking for the recipe and may start with this one.

I think there is way too much sauce for the amount of vegetables in this, so the outcome is a pan of vegetable spaghetti sauce. I even added more vegetables than called for. It really tasted great, with my added Italian spices, but you need some noodles or rice with it. I layered it also like a lasagna and still came out with a pan of spaghetti sauce. If you want a casserole type dish, then reduce the sauce. If you make it as specified put some layers of no-bake lasagna noodles in it, or plan to serve it over pasta.

This was delicious!! after reading some of the other reviews I decided to use a can of pizza sauce mixed with a can of tomato paste and I did not cook my zucchini before layering it in the pan. it was not runny at all. I baked it for 45 minutes adding the final layer of cheese in the last 5 minutes.

This was an awesome dish!! I've never cooked with zucchini before so I didn't know you have to remove the seeds lol. I added mushrooms and green pepper to the saute and used a premixed italian blend shredded cheese. Everyone loved it!! Thanks for putting it up!!

This was okay. I guess I found it a bit bland and runny. I did saute the zucchini in with the oil, garlic and onion as others recommended.

This was good, but I wasn't madly in love with it.  Followed the instructions consistently except that I also breaded some chicken to go with it to make it a little more filling.

This is really good! I agree that frying up the zucchini makes sense rather than boiling. I used less tomato sauce than indicated too. Bread crumbs along the top, and we were good to go. Kids, adults, everyone enjoyed it. The kids thought it was lasagna, and I just went with that!

though I am not much of a Zucchini fan, I decided to give this recipe a try. I loved it, but I had not cut the zucchini thin enough which was my bad. If I had really thinned the zucchini I would've given this recipe five stars! It was yummy.

I found, as others did, that the dish was very watery... more like zucchini soup rather than something comparable to eggplant parmesan.  It was very good tasting, but if you're looking for a lasagna-like way to serve zucchini, this is not the recipe you want to use.

Absolutely Delicious !  This was so good & healthy too.  (ok, except for the cheese).  I sauteed the zucchini instead of boiling it.  I also added extra garlic and used part skim mozzarella.  It was easy to make and tasted wonderful. I may end up making it again next week.  Thanks for the recipe !

This was a great and easy recipe.  Only criticism is that it's not a main dish unless you make a lot of it.  I sauteed the zucchini with the onion and garlic as others suggested and put in fresh basil (do it!). Served with bread and salad it should be filling enough, but if I were making it for company, I'd put in chicken.  That would be a hit I'm sure!!

I love love love zucchini, so I've been trying many recipes on this site. This was good - I cut the ingredients in half and used minced garlic from a jar. There was a little too much sauce, though - definitely needs to be served over pasta or with some garlic bread. Other than that a great recipe!

Very good recipe, and flexible.  I added a little more garlic, some mushrooms and chopped roma tomatoes.  I sauteed the zucchini instead of boiling it (one less pot to clean), and added all the other veggies to the skillet to sautee all together too.  I'll definitely make again!

My entire family (of four males plus me) really liked this.  Usually I have to pulverize zucchini to make it palatable to my sons (11, 13 & 18), but they loved this.  I also did not boil the zukes, I sauted them with onion, garlic and mushrooms in the olive oil.  I also used parmesan and mozzarella.  I used less marinara sauce (about 2/3 of a jar) than called for due to others stating it was watery, and it was not watery at all.
This is a keeper.  Easy and delicious.

I thought this was a really nice change for something with zucchini.  Based on reading other reviews about how watery it could be, I mixed some of my mozzerella in with the sauce/zucchini mixture before pouring in pan.  Then sprinkled remaining cheese on top.  I think I might throw in some mushrooms next time too.  I also let it sit under the broiler a few minutes before serving so it could brown a bit.  I served it with fried flounder.  It was delicious.

This was very yummy.  I sautéed the zucchini with the onions & garlic and I used 2 cups of cheese because I love cheese :)

Great Recipe!  Easy to do, everyone loved it!!  I also layered it like lasagna, baked it for a while, and a whole pan fed 5 people.  Would go great with a salad and garlic bread for a quick, vegetarian dinner.

Delicious! I also dipped zucchini (cut in half then sliced lengthwise around the core in order to remove seeds) in eggs, then plain breadcrumbs, drizzled some olive oil on top and baked at 450 for 10 mns each side. Layered using mozzarella, the sautéed onion and garlic drizzled in between along with thick sauce. 350 for additional 20 mns. Perfect..not mushy or watery.

This recipe is surprisingly good for only using a few ingredients.  I browned two chicken breasts cut into bite sized pieces and put them in the casserole dish first.  I threw in some chopped tomatoes and fresh basil from the garden and then made it exactly as posted.  Tasty and flavorful.  Filling but not heavy.  A very versatile recipe.  The leftovers were even better.

I added parmesan to mine and came out great. I also knew I didn't want to boil it since it is full of moisture so I seared it on med/high heat, turned down the heat then did my onion and garlic in the same pan.

This is the best zucchini I have found. I sauteed the zucchini with the onions and garlic, when done drained it in a colander to remove as much moisture as possible. I had more zucchini then the recipe called for so I layered it with the sauce and cheese. I used an entire can of Hunts Pasta sauce and 2 cups to mozzarella. I baked it at 375 for about 30 minutes. The more cheese the better for hubby. After making it we had something else for dinner and heated it up the next night. It was awesome....flavored through and mine didn't have any excess moisture. Will make this again & again &again.....

Very easy and tasty recipe for a beginning cook like me! After reading the reviews I sauteed the zucchini and it turned out great, not watery at all. Next time I might add mushrooms and serve it with/over pasta, that might make it a little more filling.

This is GREAT! I love this better than normal spaghettie. The only thing that I personally didnt care for is that it's not very good reheated in the microwave to eat the next day. Its best fresh. but besides that, it was DELICIOUS!

A little watery. I also sauteed the zucchini. My best advice is cook it for the next day. It set nicely and had much more flavor reheated.

I'm rating 4 stars for the recipe as is. With my adjustments, it's 5 stars for sure! I saute 1 large onion and a few cloves of garlic with 3 links of turkey sausage cut up to bite size. When the sausage is almost done cooking, I add the zucchini and saute for a few minutes. I drain the water/fat off and pour into a casserole dish. Top with jarred sauce and cheese and bake. It easily serves 6 for 205 calories per serving :) No need for pasta!

Awesome!  My daughter is a vegetarian, so it's been difficult to find recipes that we both like because I'm a carnavore and I don't even miss the meat!  This is one of the few recipes that make it in our bi-weekly menu rotation.  I don't boil the zucchini, I saute it in olive oil as others have suggested.  Perfect with Linguini.

This recipe was fantastic.  Since so many reviewers mentioned how watery the dish was, I laid my thinly sliced zucchini strips on top of paper towels, then put more paper towels on top.  I put a few heavy-bottomed pans on top to help press out the extra water in the zucchini.  Worked like a charm!  I added black pepper and red pepper flakes to the onions, and even added a box of frozen creamed spinach that I thawed.  The spinach added nice color and flavor to the dish and the red pepper flakes gave it a bit of "heat".  My husband and I LOVED this and I will absolutely make it again.  Thanks for a great recipe, Mary Jo!

This was a quick and simple recipe that tasted fabulous. Tasted even better the following day! I used Asiago cheese as that's what I had on hand. Definitely a keeper - entire family enjoyed this dish as a main and as a side the following evening. Thank you for sharing!

Pretty good recipe but definitely has room for imporvement. I steamed my zucchini rather than boiling it but there was still way too much water in the finished product. I will  make this recipe again but I think I will alter it a bit.

I changed things up a little based on other reviews.  I salted the zucchini slices and let them sit to draw out some of the moisture, then grilled them.  Stored them in the fridge overnight and assembled this today.  I did not use the olive oil or onions.  I spooned spaghetti sauce on each slice individually, topped them with shredded mozzarella and baked as directed.  Dusted with parmesan cheese after they came out of the oven.  Served with mini bowtie pasta with olive oil, salt, pepper, parmesan and parsley.  Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!

This is a great recipe with lots of possibilities! I made a few changes for myself: (1) baked some potatoes prior to mixing with everything so that I wouldn't have to cook the whole thing longer and risk burning or drying anything out (2) Sauteed the garlic and onion with zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms, bell peppers, jalapenos, and sausage (3) Layered that with the potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, celery, rosemary, thyme, oregano, basil, cheeses, spaghetti sauce, and red wine.  Next time I'm going to try this with different meats because every type I thought of was going to be a fantastic addition to this recipe.

Wonderful recipe. I added mushrooms and instead of boiling the zucchini, I sauteed it and it came out so good. I have had NO complaints, just lots of compliments. Thank you for sharing!!

This is a good, easy and quick dish to make to use up the garden zucchini. I topped it with some parmesan cheese.  We enjoyed it.  THX

If I could give more stars I would!! My kids (5,4,2) said that this was the best dinner ever. I didn't precook the zukes, so I covered with foil and cooked for about 30 mins (I sliced thick)and put under the broiler for 4 mins, the zukes were still crunchy (the way I like it)! I used half mozz. and half parm cheese and used my own sauce. Thank you very much, will be making again and again....

I don't make this as a side dish.. I make this as a healthy snack. 

Since I love junk food and I love snacking, I am always trying to find more healthy ways to indulge my weaknesses. This recipe was such a Godsend. As long as you do not cook this too long, all the health values of the zucchini remain intact.

     The first time I made this, my husband, my daughter and her boyfriend demolished my treats. 

     I had to go back to the grocery store for the ingredients to make more. It was worth it, though. :)

Very good!  I also sauteed the zucchini instead of boiling mostly because I wanted to omit the extra step.  Turned out great and I'll defiantely be making again!

We loved this... but my husband did change one thing.  We beat an egg, dipped the slices and breaded the zucchini, frying it in a little veg oil.  Then we layered it in the pan and poured over the sauce.  We topped with the mozzerella, and baked at 375 for 20 minutes... or until it was brown and bubbly.  My children didn't go for it... (they believe they hate veggies and watched us make it, so they wouldn't even try it...) but I ate 2 of their plates and couldn't believe how good it was.  The next day my cousin tried some with me at lunch and we almost finished the pan... at 3 slices a piece.  All I kept saying was that I didn't think I could stop eating it, it was sooooo good... and she agreed.  Thank you sooo much for this.

I made this recipe as it was stated.  I love it!  It's as good as I expected it would be.  We did use two large zucchini from our garden and it was still rather saucy, so you could add more zucchini if you wanted to.  This is a keeper!

This was really good!  I would slice the zucchini in half next time to make it a bit easier to eat and serve with bread since there was alot of sauce. Thanks for a great recipe!

GREAT recipe.  I made the mistake of taking off the skin from the zuccini, next time I'll leave it on.  But it was still a great recipe.  Even my son, who hates veggies loved this.  This is a keeper.  I did add some parmesan cheese to give it a cheesier flavor and it enhanced it perfectly.  Thanks to this recipe poster.

This was alright. Not so quick but easy to make. I added mushrooms to get some variety. What I didn't like was that it turned out a little watery.

I fixed this recipe for dinner last night.  I read all the reviews and made a few changes.  I did saute lightly large rounds of zucchini before putting them in a baking pan.  I covered them with cooked seasoned ground beef followed by cheese, spaghetti sauce, sauteed mushrooms, onions, garlic, more cheese, spaghetti sauce & topped with cheese.  I baked it about 35 minutes and served it over rice.  My husband & I loved it!!  I don't want to know the calorie count.  Could use low-fat cheese for that matter!!

WOW - this was delicious!!  We just added a little asiago cheese to the mozzarella.  Great way to get your veggies and use up some zucchini.  It was a little watery after baking - may saute the zucchini next time in hopes of reducing the water content.

The flavor was outstanding. I think perhaps in hopes of getting our picky eater to eat the zucchini, I overcooked it, turning it to mush. That prompted my husband to ask why there were no noodles. Was I supposed to serve it over noodles? I was under the assumption that the zucchini took the place of the noodles.

This was fantastic.  I used my husbands spaghetti sauce (which is really flavorful...and has sausage and ground beef)....and I mixed in some parmesan "shaker" cheese mixed in, rather than the mozz on top.  This is a definate keeper!!!

I made this and sorry to say I didn't like it very much.  I boiled the zucchini like it said but even after draining it there was too much water.  I even poured out a bunch of water before baking it and it still too watery.  I think it would be better if you breaded the zucchini like when you make eggplant parmesan.

My recipe is similar: 
1 each: small zucchini & small summer squash, 1/4-inch disc-sliced; 1-14-oz can Italian stewed tomatoes, chopped; 4,  1/4-inch slices fresh Mozzarella, cubed or not;1 t Italian seasoning. Layer squashes into a loaf pan. Stir in tomatoes with juices. Top with Mozzarella, then seasoning. Bake 350*/25 minutes. If necessary, brown top  under broiler.

I made it a faster and easier way because I have fibromyalgia and can’t stand for long..
I grow my own zucchini so they are pretty big. 
I just sliced them in rounds and sprayed a few cookie sheets with non-stick spray. Then I just drizzled a tiny bit of olive oil on zucchini and sprinkled with seasoned Italian bread crumbs and spices and grated Asiago cheese on them and popped them in the oven. No frying, no eggs, no mess. Cooked until soft about 20 min. 
Pulled them out and they are ready to layer. Never frying again!! I mix seasonings in my ricotta with 1 egg. 
Made a meat sauce with fresh garlic and onions. 
Layer everything . Added grated Asiago between all layers too for flavor. We like it better then Parmesan or Romano. I buy a wedge at Trader Joe’s! Yum!!

I also sauteed the sliced zucchini with the onions and butter and added some grated parmesan cheese to the mozzarella.  It was watery, but flavor was very good.  I will make again and try letting it sit for 15 minutes to see if that helps.  Served as a side dish, but would be very good over pasta.

Sautéed the zucchini then added the onion and garlic - added additional garlic.  I didn't measure the sauce, just added the amount that visually looked right to me.  Topped with shredded  parmesan and mozzarella.  Loved how easy this was and tasted amazing.

Just okay, I added some bread crumbs but to make it more like authentic parmesan it needs to be egged breaded and fried.

I made this dish with homegrown zucchini today.   I made no changes, (well maybe a bit more garlic.) I put the zucchini over thin spaghetti with a sprinkle of Locatelli.  It was absolutely delicious.

I made a couple of changes. I microwaved the sliced zucchini until tender, then added it to the onions and garlic. Next time I will add mushrooms too. I added a whole jar of the vegetable garden spagetti sauce and added some red peppers for some heat. My husband is italian so he likes a lot of sauce. I also served it with a side salad and garlic rolls. Great light meatless dinner.

I made this  as the recipe stated for the first time and served over pasta. Very good.   No changes necessary.  My seven year old FINICKY granddaughter loved and devoured it.  When she was finished, I then told her what it was, that's when I got the krinkled up nose but she admiitted she would eat it again.

Great, but why is it called "parmesan" when there is no parmesan cheese in it?

First and foremost - why is it call Parmesan if there is n Parmesan in it??  I did not follow the recipe exactly so I cannot give it more than one star.

My husband and I loved this. I added salt and pepper to the zucchini before pouring the sauce over it. We are it over angel hair pasta. It's a great summer meal and I will definitely make it again.

We decided to sauté the zucchini and some yellow squash with the onion and garlic.  We added a pound of ground beef to the mixture and served it with a piece of texas toast.  My husband considered it a good "dinner casserole" and he's not easy to please.

Easy to make, very tasty! I did not soften the zucchini first, just tossed it a bit in the pan with garlic and onion before putting it in the casserole dish. To make this a complete meal I am going to add diced chicken next time !

Excellent and simple to make. I also sautéed the zucchini and onions with garlic. Then I added Italian Pablo breadcrumbs over the top to add texture. Delicious!

I loved this!  I added some Super Greens pasta to the bottom of a dish, layered par-boiled zucchini, fried onion and ground spicy sausage, another layer or zucchini and topped with spicy marinara and mozzarella.   It was fantastic!  Next time instead of the pasta I will layer in summer squash!

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it! I'm the only one in the house that's vegetarian, so they weren't to happy when I told them what I was making.. Once they tried it, I promise you it was gone in 30 minutes. They kept talking about how good it was! I didn't alter the instructions any, I did everything it told me to do and had everything it needed! I'm in love with this dish and I WILL be making it again for sure!

I really loved this recipe and did saute the zucchini with onions and mushroom as other reviewers suggested.  But next time I plan on slicing the zucchini much thicker so that it resembles Eggplant Parmesan more closely with the feeling of thick vegetable "steaks".  I did add 1/3 cup parmesan to the sauteed zucchini mixture so that the recipe would be more true to its name.

So  delicious! So easy! My boyfriend and I would have finished the 9x9 pan if it weren't for that measly maximum stomach capacity. I followed the instructions to the letter, apart from sauteing the zucchini with the garlic and onions, and I served over angel hair pasta. It was a little watery, but that mixed well with the pasta. Definitely making this one frequently, and I think I'll be pulling it out when I next need to impress my boyfriend's mother!

I shredded the zucchini so it was easier for my kids to eat. It was a hit at my house. I browned some lean beef and layered the shredded zucchini then jar sauce then cheese :) shredded is def the way to go!

It was decent but too watery and bland. I also didn't let my zucchini boil long enough because I had to cook it 20 extra minutes just to ensure that the zucchini wasn't tough. It did help use up zucchini though.  So one word of advice, don't boil your zucchini.

I sauteed the zucchini, onions and garlic instead of boiling. I used about 1/4 of a jar of marinara and three sliced fresh tomatoes. (instead of a whole jar). Also added fresh basil. 

It was lovely and I will make it again.  

Thank you Mary Jo!

I've made this several times--it's become one of our staples. I saute the zucchini with the onion and garlic. I add about 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the sauce mixture.  I also add parmesan cheese and bread crumbs on top before baking. It's delicious and easy.

Simple and delicious!  Gobbled up even by the summer squash haters.  I used plenty of zucchini and added a bell pepper and a bunch of kale (all sauteed in the same pan as the onion and garlic).  Less cheese.  Served with a loaf of crusty rosemary bread.

I will definitely make it again.  I changed it like many others that I read reviews on.  I steamed the zucchini in a steamer on the stove so it did not become watery like some I read.  I also used ground turkey and fried it up with the onion and garlic with salt and garlic powder. I added canned mushrooms then when it was cooked I added the sauce and simmered it some.  Then I layered starting with the sauce then zucchini then the mozzarella like a lasagna.  Baked it and it turned out great.  My family loved it.

Tried this recipe tonight, hubby liked it! Used canned stewed tomatoes and added mushrooms and didn't have any Parmesan. I also didn't use the breadcrumb topping. Should have drained the tomatoes a little bit more but hubby said it would go well on rice. Will try it again, I enjoyed it!

Ooh this is so surprisingly good! I added turkey sausage and sauteed mushrooms to the zucchini before I put it in the oven, and also I poured some of the liquid off about half way through the cooking time.  It was still a little watery, but I think next time I will saute the zucchini before I bake it because I like my squash a little stiff when I eat it.

Loved this recipe! My husband also loved it, and he is not a big fan of zucchini. The casserole was a bit runny after baking but I just scooped out the water from the corner of the pan. It was hardy enough to serve as a main dish for vegetarians.

Superb!  Pan-fried the zucchini after salting both sides, then put in the oven with the marinara sauce and cheese.  The kids and husband were surprised to like it!  We did notice that the skin was really thick and bitter so we ended up cutting it off.

Outstanding!  I added a thin layer of Ricotta and seasoned it with garlic powder, onion powder and some crushed red pepper flakes. I also used a Mushroom and Onion jar sauce (not the whole jar since I had small zucchini's) I had one serving and my husband ate the rest - which upset me cause I wanted more!!!  I literally turned around and it was gone! A really great new use for zucchini.  Thanks =)

I had a zucchini the size of a kids t-ball bat and didn't know what to do with it.  I made this recipe almost as is and it was awesome (I added parmesan cheese because zucchini parm should have parm in it!)  I did let the boiled zucchini sit in a colander and drain for about 15 minutes and didn't have that watery sauce everyone else talked about.  My three kids (who claim to hate zucchini) ate a huge plate each :).  Since I made a double batch, we can enjoy it for a few days!

I did add some bread crumbs to prevent the dish from being watery and also added some grated parmesan. Loved it! Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely phenomenal.  We used homemade spaghetti sauce which is delicious, but this dish was a big hit - we'll definitely be making it again!

Sauteed the zucchini as recommended because I remember boiled zucchini as a kid, you could never drain all the water out! I used a 9x9 dish instead of 9x12 because our zucchini here doesnt get very big and this didnt make enough for that dish size. The cheese didnt brown or bubble at this temp after 30 minutes but it was hot and tasty! Even my husband, who doesnt like the "idea" of onions as a main ingredient of any dish didnt even mention that there were onions! I meant to use the brown sugar but forgot- but no heartburn was mentioned either! Not Watery! And my picky eater of a 6 year old had his first zucchini prepared this way and didnt say it was Yucky. Can't beat that! Im a beginner with cooking and this dish took some time but if you like zucchini, try it!

I thought this recipe was delicious:) Even my very picky 6 year old asked for seconds! I didn't have any mozzarella so I used parmesan cheese and cooked some pasta to go with! I will be making this again:) Thanks for the recipe!!

Easy is right. If I can make this, anyone can. I'm still developing my cooking skills. My husband really liked this. Impressing him is good because he's the better cook. I halved the recipe because I only had one zucchini to use. I also didn't have garlic, but instead used seasonings that had garlic and few other ingredients in them. Then I sprinkled some adobo over the zucchini before putting the spaghetti sauce over it. It still turned out and was very tasty. Great recipe Mary Jo! This one is going in my recipe box. Thank you for sharing it.

Excelent! I did it just a little bit different...I used Pomodoro Tomatoe Sauce from Trader Joes, I added shopped jalapenos to the onions and garlic (without the seeds)and I mixed Kraft parmesan cheese with the mozzarella cheese.

Good and tasty, this dish combines all my favorite foods, but baking results in a thin sauce. I skillet sauted everything before the sauce and cheese steps and then baked it over a thin slice of grilled red polenta (red from the sweet red pepper paste I added to the mix) and served with a slice of Texas garlic toast. Yummy!

My daughters loved this! I used 3 zucchini and 3 yellow squash cut in long pieces. I baked them with a little olive oil spray, salt, and pepper. I also made my own marinara sauce. Will make again, thanks!

Very good recipe.  I took the advise of other reviewers and throw the zucchini in with the onions and garlic.  I also used Prego Chunky garden sauce and it was not runny at all.  In fact it was very thick and delicous!  I made it for just me and my boyfiend and we almost it it all!  Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out quite well - after reading the reviews about the watery potential, I sauted the zucchini before adding it to the dish.  Will definitely be making again.

I did what other reviewers mentioned and put the zucchini in the pan with the onions rather than boiling them - they stayed perfectly firm (but not too firm) and definitely not watery at all. 
I served this over thin spaghetti and used a Bertolli marinara sauce. It was delish. However, the recipe name is a huge misnomer as it does not call for any parmesan at all......it should be called "Zucchini Mozarella" or something.

I encountered the "watery" issue, too, when I made this, as expressed in many other reviews. But, I really had no complaints about the taste! However, I would NOT recommend eating this the day you make it. This is a dish best left to marinate in its own juices to let the flavors mix and intensify. Much better as a leftover/warm-up the next day. I used the recipe for my lunch side dish every day for a week!

Wasn't a fan. There were too many onions for me so I'm definitely trying fewer onions next time to see if I like it better.

What a great way to use extra zucchini!  We loved this recipe because it was both delicious and easy.  I did sauté the zucchini and added some herbs (basil, rosemary, and parsley)and a little bit of red pepper flakes while it was cooking.  I had some sauce leftover from the World's Best Lasagne (and it really is!) so I used that instead of a jar of sauce and it was amazing!  It was great as leftovers too.

I added parmesan cheese and an eggplant, and served it with spaghetti.  Very good recipe, will definitely make it again.

This was very good. I sauted the zucchini instead of boiling and they were too firm. Next time I will follow recipe and boil first.

Why is this called Parmesan when there is not even parmesan cheese in the recipe? This tasted all right but was a little disappointing. I added pasta to make it a meal.

Good. Not my favorite way to use up zucchini, but it was a nice change and I'd probably make it again.

Was not overly impressed with this recipe.  It lacked flavor so i had to add some garlic salt to the boiling water. Also after dinner I think we realized had it been breaded and baked or breaded and fried it would have gone along much better.

going to try this tonight but instead of boiling, I will dip zucchini in Italian bread crumbs and brown in olive oil, then bake with sauce and cheese.

Very quick and easy! Good basic recipe. I add portabella mushrooms and broccoli and made my own sauce.

Followed other reviewer's tips and sauteed the zucchini in olive oil with garlic powder.  Skipped the onions because I used a spaghetti sauce with chunks of onion and garlic in it.  Used 2 cups of cheese also.  This was a fast and fab meal - thanks!

This recipe was great! I think that following the recipe and cutting them "thin" made the seeds come out in the boiling water. So, to do it next time I might cut them thicker or fry them instead of boiling. I served them with fryed potatotes and Texas toast. Loved it!

Instead of boiling the zucchini, I microwaved them first with just a little water & then drained them.  I also used part skim milk mozzarella which tasted fine.  You save calories with this recipe as you don't bread the zucchini or add ricotta or cottage cheese.

This had mixed reviews in my house.  I didn't like it, (probably because I am sauce-phobic), but my boyfriend thought it was pretty good.  Even after sauteeing the zucchini it seemed to weep a bit.  I used slices of muenster cheese in place of mozzarella, which bubbled up beautifully.

This had a nice flavor and was eaten quickly by my family. Like the previous reviewers, this would be even better with layering like lasagna, with additional cheese & veggies. As the instructions were given, the Zucchini slices were difficult to stir with the sauce, as I had some large zucchini I was using up. Good job and thanks for sharing!

Tasty dish. Great when you don't have eggplant and another innovative way to get rid of all those zucchini.
