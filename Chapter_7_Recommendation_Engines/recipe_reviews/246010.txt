This was a dish I dearly loved to eat when I was stationed in Japan. My small town of Misawa in Aomori-ken had either a breaded pork cutlet or a breaded chicken breast, sliced thin so that there was no need to try to cut the meat smaller in order to fit it in the mouth. With pork, it was called "katsudon" which was a shortened version of  "tonkatsu" (the katsu part was from English "cutlet") and "donburi" or "meal in a bowl." If you used chicken, the name changed to oyaku donburi, where the oyaku means "mother & child" due to having both chicken and egg. I will sometimes make this dish without meat, just the egg and veggies (I add mushrooms), and have it for breakfast. Give this dish a try!

I made this with leftover chicken curlet! I sprinkled green onions right before turning off the fire.  This is a childhood favorite of mine too! Yummy!

I'll definitely make this again.

It was very good although I did prepare some of the ingredients wrong. Next time I'll add some seasoning to the rice, for sure. I ended up using  chicken stock instead of dashi stock , too. I made it for some of my family and the overall reviews were positive- also, if you're making this meal for four, only use about two cups of rice and double everything else! I cooked way too much rice using three cups (I think after I cooked it, there was about 11 cups worth of rice.) Overall delicious!
