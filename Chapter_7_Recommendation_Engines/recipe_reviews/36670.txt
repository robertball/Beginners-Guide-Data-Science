Very good! I doubled the marinade and used made kabobs of mushrooms, red onion, and bell pepper. Two suggestions....a tad less pepper, maybe only 1 1/2 tsp....it was very peppery. Also, if you marinate veggies, I wouldn't marinate mushrooms too long....mine absorbed the marinade like a sponge and were very lemony although the other veggies were not. Will be making this often!

Thought this recipe was really just OK.  This is not a recipe that I would make again for family or guests.  There just wasn't much of an extraordinary taste to the prawns.

This is a very tasty recipe. Be sure to get LARGE shrimp and don't overcook them. I got shrimp that were too small and my husband grilled them for too long and they ended up dry. The shrimp still had a very good taste. I plan to try it again with the large shrimp and a timer!

Excellent!  I used Worcestershire sauce, because steak sauce (I was thinking like A-1) seemed too thick.  I added chunks of bell pepper, onion, zucchini, and whole cherry tomatoes to the skewers.  Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with Creole or Cajun seasoning mix.

Wonderful!!  My son said this was the best homemade dinner he ever had.  I served these with some rice pilaf, a big green salad and sour dough bread.  I used fresh minced garlic, and the only thing I added to the marinade was some red pepper flakes as we like things a little spicy.  We basted the kabobs with the marinade as they grilled,  & poured the garlic and pepper that had settled to the bottom over at the end - Yum!!

I thought these were just OK. They maybe better if you marinate them for longer than 20 minutes. I thought they were rather bland.

Very good!  Everyone liked this recipe a lot.  I thought it was going to be too much garlic, but it wasn't.  I will definately make this again! Thanks!

Marinated wedges of green pepper, mushrooms, onions, and tomatoes in the sauce for a couple hours before marinating the shrimp. The combination made delicious and easy kebabs!  Nice and spicy!

Took these to a cook out a few months back and they were quite the hit! Easy to make and soooo tasty! The lemon and garlic together were delicious. Don't forget to soak your skewers for at least an hour.

To the reviewer who said their shrimp turned out like rubber, well, there's a reason the recipe calls for marinating for only 20 minutes. Any type of acid will actually cook the shrimp. Certainly not the fault of this delicious recipe.

I was disappointed with this one.  Next time(?) I would add more garlic.  I'd like to try just brushing marinade onto shrimp while grilling as I found them to be rubbery when left in marinade.

This recipe is just wrong on so many levels.  Maybe I mainated the shrimp too long (all day).  Cooked exactly 2 minutes per side.  This turned out like rubber.  The garlic did not stand out at all or the wine.  Tasted like lemon rubber.  Don't need to be asked not to make this again.

This turned out very flavorful but the shrimp were a little bit "rubbery". I added vegetables to the skewers and overall, this was an easy meal. I might cut the cooking time down some next time so they won't get so "rubbery".

I marinaded these for about 24hrs because I wanted lots of flavor. We thought they were quite good but a little bit on the sweet side - probably the wine I used. Thanks.

The kids and I got Dad a new BBQ for Father's Day and this was the first thing he cooked. The shrimp came out perfectly, but couldn't really taste the marinade - I don't think I let the shrimp soak long enough as I was hungry!!

Very good flavor. I used Lowery's steak sauce and also sprinkled in a little Lowery's seasoned salt.

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  It doesn't seem to have a dominant flavour, either lemon or garlic, and it just winds up being bland.  I feel that this recipe really needs a lot of tweaking before I'd be happy with it.
