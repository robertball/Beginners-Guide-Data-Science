This recipe was great. Although I got tired of having to separate egg yokes and what-not..I just mixed it all up in the mixer and it turned out fine!

WOW!   Yummy!  The BEST waffles we have ever had.  I must admit that I put all the ingredients in one big bowl and mixed by hand.  No fancy hoopla like the recipe says,  and I threw out the egg whites.  Oops.  BUT~  they were still awesome.  It took me about 1 minute to prepare the batter.   That's right!  And we still loved them.  We sliced fresh strawberries mixed with sugar and topped with Cool whip.  FANTASTICO!

I loved the texture of these. Crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The only problem was that they had no flavor. All I could taste was the maple syrup I put on. This would be a perfect recipe to add blueberries to.

These waffles were absolutely wonderful. Beating the egg whites is important as it incorporates air and makes them light. I always add a bit of vanilla to my waffles and pancakes, also. Sometimes cinnamon. (I can't believe a reviewer would give this wonderful recipe 3 stars because it's too much work at 5am. DUH! Stick to cold cereal or toast,then!!)

Is it legal to sell these? These waffles were the best waffles ever! I made double the recipe and gave them away for presents! I am speechless! The name really is true! Only one thing though. I found they weren't that sweet. I Put 1/4 more sugar and put a little bit of chocolate chips and they were even better!

Definitely a perfect recipe for "Wonderful Waffles"! These were light, fluffy, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside - what more could you as for on a Sunday morning. I've made waffles before just adding the egg whole vs. separating and whipping the egg whites until nice and fluffy. I must say it's worth the extra step of whipping the egg whites and folding them in - the result was a much fluffier waffle. I melted the butter and used 6 Tbsp. of white sugar vs. brown and added a generous splash of vanilla. These are delicious topped with butter, real maple syrup or fresh fruit and whipped cream! Thanks for a great recipe!

Definately not the quickest waffle recipe, but well worth it!  I typically make waffles enmass to freeze for kids breakfast...before I could bag them my daughter grabbed one and said, 'These are really good, mom!'  Texture reminds me of the inards of a popover.

The Best!!!! My family loved them and they are a very tough crowd.  It was easy to make. I followed earlier advice about putting all the ingredients in one bowl and mixing. I made them early and warmed them in the oven and they were perfect.  I will make a double batch next time so I can freeze some for breakfast on school days.

Very good recipe.  I had buttermilk I wanted to get rid of, and it made the most delicious waffles!!  I cooked them in the waffle iron for 3 minutes and they were perfect.

My Families favorite breakfast. I no longer follow all of the measurements or use the egg whites. I believe the waffles taste better throwing the ingredients together.

If you only have one mixer: get out two big bowls and a little bowl. Start by separating the eggs and whipping the whites in one of the big bowls. (set that aside) In the little bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt with the mixer.  In the other big bowl, whip the brown sugar and the egg yolks, then whip in the softened butter.  Pour the buttermilk into that mixture and keep mixing until it's all creamy.  Put away the mixer!  Use a spatula to combine the flour and buttermilk mixture.  Then mix in a quarter of the whipped egg whites with that spatula.  The last of the whipped egg whites will then easily and gently fold in with your spatula.  You are going to love these waffles!

We are whole wheat flour eaters so I substituted the white flour for the whole wheat.  Turned out fantastic.  Also I added some vanilla.  I did not have any buttermilk so I made my own.  It is one cup of milk + 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.  I hope this helps!

When I whipped the egg whites, I used my Kitchen Aid mixer. I chilled the mixer bowl and the whipping attachment for thirty minutes before attempting to whip the egg whites. Once I got those egg whites done, this recipe was cake. The outside of the waffle was crispy and the inside of the waffle was fluffy and soft. One of the best waffles I've ever made. The whole family loved them.

Don't waste your time.  I have no idea why this recipe has received so many good reviews.  I have been making home made waffles for quite some time now and thought I'd try something new so gave this a shot.  My husband and I both couldn't finish just one waffle.   Pass on this and and keep searching. I will edity soon with a better receipe that we usually use from this site.

Its not really my favourite recipe since it uses butter in the batter, but it did turn out very light - cruncy on the outside but fluffy on the inside! I actually only used a wee bit of baking soda and no baking power.

I did not separate the eggs as directed and instead I beat them well and added wet and then dry ingredients and they turned out terrific. Great breakfast by the pool! Thanks for sharing!

These were wonderful. No harder than any other waffle recipe. These were light and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I loved the use of Brown sugar, but think that White sugar might make them a little lighter. I added 1 tbsp. of pure vanilla, they were not overly sweet but I like that, my family piles on enough whipped cream, berries and Syrup that you wouldn't want them to be any sweeter than they were. This is a keeper for sure.

SUCH a step up from my ten year old sister's 'oops i put too much baking soda in again and just eat around the lumps' waffles. Although I love her, this is the recipe we'll be using from here on out. I used half white and half wheat flour. It worked like a charm, and I took everyone's advice and just mixed it all together in a bowl. I love the way the brown sugar tastes too.

These waffles tasted good, but were not worth the extra effort in making them.  They were really light and fluffy, and we prefer a denser waffle.

Fantastic recipe and well worth the time spent!!  Waffles were crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  The only changes I made to the recipe were to replace butter and buttermilk with buttery spread and rice milk/vinegar mixture to make it dairy free.  This is definitely a keeper!

Wow these are good! Time consuming but worth the time.  The second time I made these I was more organized so it went a bit faster.  I highly suggest these for a brunch when you have company over! My only change was to add some cinnamon - GREAT RECIPE!

These are pretty good. Loved the texture of the waffles. However I tasted the first one and it was kind of bland. Slightly sweet but just not quite right. So I added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla to the batter. Perfect :) Thanks for the recipe.

My family went crazy over these. They were really good, but to be honest, I didn't see the difference between these and other good waffles I've made. But, 5 stars since they were very good and my family thinks they are the best ever! I didn't do anything different, except add a tsp of vanilla, and cinnamon to a batch. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was hesitant to try this since some of the reviews had commented it was a lot of work, HOWEVER I am so glad I decided to try it anyway.  These waffles are worth any extra steps you have to take.  Just do it ... you will be thrilled with the results.

This recipe tastes amazing! We made them with a few changes: gluten free w/Bob's Red Mill AP Flour, ground flax seed as an egg replacement, regular milk and cherries. They were a hit with the whole family! :)

First waffle recipe I've ever made.  They were good, but I thought they were missing some oomph, so I substituted the all-purpose with whole wheat the second time around and they were fantastic!  Really hearty with the wheat, but my boyfriend loved them either way.  I made mine with fresh blueberries, YUM!

If using the Self-Rising flour omit the salt, baking soda and baking powder. Recipe was spot on for batter consistency. I followed the recipe as stated except for the flour.  I never buy All-Purpose so I adjusted for the Self-Rising.   I made 2 batches, one was plain and the other was more flavorful.   I added 1/2 tsp on vanilla and about 1/2 cup of blueberries. The dash of vanilla and blueberries made a great waffle.  I think one should add a dash of vanilla if using the original recipe for extra flavor.  This one is a keeper.

I made these for the first time this morning.  They were delicious!  I only had 1 cup of buttermilk and didn't want to make sour milk, so I used 1 cup of buttermilk and 1 cup of nonfat milk.  Also, I did as other reviewers have said and added the entire egg, without separating them first.  I only had whole wheat pastry flour on hand, but they still turned out great and the texture was wonderful.  This recipe did make quite a few waffles for our small family, so I was able to freeze a couple extras.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I'll make it next time as written.

These waffles are awesome! They seem like a bit of work but really it's not much, especially considering how great they turn out.   I would suggest preparing it like the directions say, or at least whipping the egg whites so the waffles are nice and fluffy.  I also add cinnamon or vanilla extract sometimes...both are very nice additions :)

These waffles were delicious!!! I added a tsp of French Vanilla extract and a tsp of orange zest to them. They were better than IHOPs!!!  They came out nice and fluffy and the batter was a perfect consistency!! I am going to make these every weekend!

Finally found a waffle recipe that tastes like the kind you get in a diner. This was delicious...after making a few waffles & tasting them decided to add a bit of vanilla extract to the batter...other than that followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.

These were the fluffiest waffles I have ever made.  I followed the recipe with a few variations - I was out of butter, so I used 1/4 cup vegetable shortening with 1 tsp of water as a substitute.  Also, I don't keep buttermilk on hand so I added 2 tbsp to 2 cups of whole milk and let it sit for about 5 minutes.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla extract.  This recipe is well worth the effort.

Other reviewers were correct: this is NOT a project for a weekday morning, unless said weekday morning is a holiday.   That said, the waffles were very, very good.  They tasted wonderful, and the texture, although different from "mix" waffles, was not displeasing.  My husband prefers crispier waffles, so I melted the butter (I'm not sure why this works, but it does!) and baked his for a little longer. The recipe makes more than the three of us can consume on a Saturday morning, so I'll wrap the leftovers and we'll have them tomorrow.  The only complaint (from our teenager) is that the waffles were a little "eggy".  Next time, I'll try it with only two yolks. Vanilla might make a nice addition, but I don't think it's necessary.  Will definitely make again.

Really good!  Light, crisp and fluffy.  It did dirty a lot of bowls, so I probably won't make it often, but a good recipe to try.  I loved the use of buttermilk.

These waffles do produce a beautiful color and wonderful texture.  I did not quite like that the flavor was egg.  Think if I do make this again I will add some flavor like vanilla or cinnamon & nutmeg or all three.  Still trying to find the recipe that they use at my favorite breakfast place in Chicago (Cozy Corner).  Will keep looking thank you for the recipe though.

Wonderful Waffles Haiku: "Doubt I'd make again. Perfect texture, so-so taste. This was too much work." I ignored so many of the reviews that said they just dumped all the ingredients together, and chose to follow the tedious (IMHO, more than the stated 15 min.) recipe directions. The texture (crispy outside, fluffy inside, far from dense or gummy) was sublime, but the taste wasn't mind-blowing. I suppose if I was to make these again, I'd toss all the ingredients together (more than likely voiding the perfect texture), along w/ vanilla extract, or blueberries or chocolate chips for more flavor.

The texture of these waffles is great!  I followed the directions exactly as written.  They were nice and fluffy and moist. The taste is lacking a little though.  I don't normally eat syrup on my waffles, but I did feel I needed it with these.  I made another batch and added blueberries.  Those turned out pretty well too.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are yummy! I followed step 1 exactly. Did step 2 but only used 2 eggs and put in the entire egg. I skipped step 3 completely. My waffles came out just fine this way. I did not mix the dry ingredients with the wet until I was ready to cook them. My husband and kids love these. Thanks!

The reason i'm giving this only 3 stars is because you need 3 BOWLS to make this recipe! Too much work for not enough pay-off, and it tasted way to eggy.

These waffles are so good.   They take a little time but are worth the time and effort.   I did add a little vanilla as someone suggested...wonderful!   If they are not as crispy on the outside as you want, put the top of the waffle iron down on them, again, for about 30 seconds...that helps.

After many years of searching, I finally found my favorite waffle recipe! I don't do all the complicated steps, either. I just pour every thing in and mix it with a wisk. I also use white sugar instead of brown, just because we like the taste of a slightly sweeter waffle.

These were worth every bit of effort!  My kids had fun and they learned how to separate eggs!  We mixed in Chocolate chips in and they turned out excellent!  Thank you!

These were wonderful.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used dark brown sugar and added just a pinch of sugar to the egg whites.  Will definitely used this again--the are well worth the time and effort

Delicious!!  Made these for breakfast this a.m. and they were a hit!!  The only variation I made to the recipe was to add 1 TBLS of Vanilla.  Beating the egg whites does add a little time to the recipe, but it is oh-so-worth-it!!

Worth beating egg whites for!  I substitute 1/3 to 1/2 of the white flour with brown and they're still nice and fluffy.

Definitely a recipe worth tucking away. I recommend going through the trouble of separating the egg, and sifting. Its a little extra work, but the fluffy texture is well worth it.  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond extract to give it a fuller flavor. Received raving reviews! Enjoy!

Wonderful waffles were indeed wonderful!!! Crispy on the outside, very nice flavor. Will make again in bulk and freeze for my kid's winter breakfasts. Might add just a tad bit of vanilla next time and see what happens.

I was really excited for these due to all the great reviews, but I didn't think they were all that great. Kind of heavy and bland tasting. Made exactly as stated. Will keep looking for my perfect waffle recipe.

Truly wonderful waffles - really liked the fluffy texture. I used lowfat buttermilk and added a t. vanilla and had great results. Despite some reviews saying it was not necessary, I did go through the extra steps of separating the egg yolks and whites.

These were disappointing. I expected a crispy outside, and it was soft. I even left them in the waffle iron longer than expected. Not at all what I expected.

Excellent recipe.  I made these in school with my students and they loved them!  Nice and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside and perfect flavor.  I might be inclined to add some vanilla.

These were pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly (only a tiny bit of yolk got in with the egg whites so they didn't whip up as much as they would otherwise have done).  We liked them but didn't think they were our favorite waffles ever.  Like past reviewers said, there just wasn't that much flavor, even when I added blueberries.

This is the most delicious waffle recipe I have ever made! I used to make waffles with regular old pancake batter, but now I see the benefits of using a batter specifically for waffles. (:    For flavour, I added a dash of vanilla. This was definitely a good idea.    Inconveniently, though, I didn't have any buttermilk in my fridge. You can make a very quick, easy replacement for buttermilk, though. For this recipe, I put 2 cups of milk in a measuring cup, and added 2 tbsp of vinegar (instead of vinegar, you can also use lemon juice, too). I let it sit for about 10 minutes. It was the perfect substitute!    These waffles were light, fluffy, and delicious. The batter made 22 waffles for me. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who asked! Yes, it took more time then you would expect for a waffle recipe, but it was TOTALLY worth it. :)

This recipe makes the best waffles I've ever eaten!  Don't just put everything in the mixer like some have.  Beating the egg whites helps keep the waffles ligt and fluffy.  It's definitely worth the effort, and the waffles are incredible

This recipe was very good.  Because I had strawberries on hand and needed to use them up, they were added to this recipe (sliced thin).  I also subsituted the milk for buttermilk, cause buttermilk makes everything taste better.  And because I added buttermilk, about 1 scant tsp of baking soda was added in addition to the baking powder.  The baking powder reacts with the acid in the buttermilk enhancing the rise and fluffiness factor.  Also added some vanilla and butter extracts (about 1 1/2 tsp.).  Make this recipe and enjoy.

Loved these waffles. I asked my son what would he like special for dinner, he responded chicken and waffles.  Interesting? I was going to use a boxed pancake mix, but thought I'll try it from scratch, found this recipe.  My son said this is definitely a 5 out of 5.  My husband hates waffles, but loved this.  It's a keeper

I am giving this recipe and 3 star for  one reason and it's not taste. The taste and texture was wonderful...best I've had as far as homeade goes, but NO ONE wants to whip up egg whites at 5 in the morning for a quick brekfast waffle. I would say to make these AHEAD of time and freeze.

Not only can you freeze them in ziplocs, you just pop them in your toaster! Fast yummy breakfast! Much less expensive than store bought, and better tasting! Who would have thought...!

These waffles looked nice but they had no flavour. They were also oddly light. I would not make these again.

5 Stars, no question about it. These waffles are exceptional! Made them according to directions, no changes, and they were crisp on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside. Everyone liked these. A great recipe, and a real keeper. Thanks!

Fantastic...slightly more light and fluffy when the egg whites are beaten according to the recipe directions versus being added whole.  Either way, these are our favorite waffles.

First off, thanks for submitting this great recipe.  I made the batter EXACTLY as given (it always bothers me when folks change a million things and then complain about how the recipe turned out...submit your own!).  I also used a Waring Pro rotating Belgian waffle iron, heat dial to 5.5 and let it cook a bit past the first beep cycle.

These waffles were some of the best I've had.  They remained crispy on the outside even though I poured syrup on top and walked away to load my dishwasher.  I plan to put mini choc chips in the batter for my kids.  These were great, and the batter really only took me about 12 minutes to prepare, even with the yolk/white separating.

My family loves waffles and has hard time finding the recipe my dad had from my childhood. This is the best one we've found in years of searching.  Taste, texture, easy to make.  As my husband says, this one's a keeper!

MMM...Mmmm!! My whole family loved these crispy, yet tender waffles. It was a bit more work, and lots of dishes to do, but it is worth it. AND I have some left over to freeze. Yay, breakfast tomorrow!

I prepared this recipe for 2 servings.  This made two wonderful waffles.  I sprinkled chopped pecans on top of the batter before baking.  They were crunchy on the outside and soft & tender inside.

I made this as per the directions and also as per the comments (mixing dry in one bowl, wet in another and then combining) in the same night. I actually think the combine-all method produced a fluffier waffle and was way less overall work. I also added vanilla to the combine-all version and it turned out a little more flavorful. Made these to freeze for my own "eggo" breakfasts. Turned out great.

Really excellent!  I hadn't read too far into it before getting all the ingredients, and once I did, I was worried that it would be too much work (beating the egg whites).  But I put the bacon in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes and made the batter during that time.  Then turned off the oven and kept the bacon warm while making these. Wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe.

We loved these!  I put lemon extract, lemon peel and fresh blueberries in half of them (for me) and left the other half plain for hubby (just added about 1/2 t vanilla).  Didn't change a thing otherwise.  Light, fluffy and moist - not heavy at all.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Amazing! followed recipe exactly (even split the egg yolk/white and it is worth it!) made waffles for first time on a borrowed griddle - came out perfect! 
made pancakes another day with left over buttermilk, froze left over pancakes and toasted them later - great idea for quick kids breakfast before school. thanks!

I made this for the first time as i've got a new waffle maker for christmas. I followed the recipe and the only difference i made was that I didnt not whisk the eggs separately and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I let it stand 1 hour while my family got ready. It still came out great because my family prefer the waffles to be a little bit dense than too fluffy and light. I did not use a spray and it came out perfect and did not stick to the waffle maker at all. My whole family loved it ! I read from a review that its important to wait till the steam dies down to check on the waffles. Best advice for a noob for me. I will be making them in a bigger batch to store in the freezer in future.

This was a great basic waffle recipe.  However, I like a little flavor in my waffles, so I added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  The amount of sugar called for is perfect and complimented the added spice very nicely.  These waffles cooked beautifully.  Great texture.  Slightly crispy on the outside and light and fluffy within.  Great recipe!

*Note - sift the cinnamon and nutmeg in with the dry ingredients and beat the vanilla in when you add the egg yolks to the sugar/buttter mixture.

Outstanding waffles! The best we have ever had.  We followed the recipe exactly they came out perfect. The brown sugar was the kicker, we had a rasher of bacon along with it, and the sweet and salty was wonderful.

I've tried several recipes & ... this is one of 'em.  :l  ;)  For flavor, kinda bland; but that's why we have syrup!  :)  Texture is kinda rubbery, but it may just be my wafflemaker.  Most of the recipes I've tried are rubbery - except the one that was soooo crispy it almost seemed fried like a chip!  :O :D  Anyway, not for us; but I'm glad I tried it.

First time making waffles from scratch and I was not disappointed!  These are wonderful!  Although I thought it was strange there was no vanilla so I added 1 teaspoon.  But thats the only change I made.  Crisp on the outside and light and fluffy inside, they almost melt in your mouth!  Wonderful flavor and not too sweet.  I didn't have any to freeze because we ate them all!  I may try other recipes but I will hang on to this one, it's a keeper!

I made these because they used buttermilk which I happened to have on hand. Unfortunately they did not turn out crispy as indicated. They were soft, and eggy as some others have mentioned. I am beginning to want to avoid all waffle recipes where they have you whip egg whites. This seems to happen a lot to me with those type of recipes.

Followed recipe exactly, but they were not crispy on the outside -- instead they were soft.  And, I agree that they really have no flavor.  Bland.  Sorry, but I won't make again.  I always think you should try it for your own tastes though.  Obviously, based on the ratings, people can disagree.  Thanks for sharing!

I bought a All-Clad Waffle maker and I tried this receipe out for the first time an boy I will never buy a boxed waffle mix again.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla and they taste wonderful. Waffles are crisp and light. I would say for all the work making these waffles it's well worth it!!!

I didn't have enough eggs, so I used the one I had in the fridge and then use 2 tablespoons of ground flax seed blended with 6 tablespoons of water. I made the first waffle as the ingredients state (with the egg exception) and it was great. I then read the reviews of others and added blueberries, vanilla, and cinnamon. The following waffles were FANTASTIC! I should mention that I just put all the ingredients in one bowl and mixed them together, as others stated. Fantastic! I don't think I'll even try other recipes...

This was a GREAT starter recipe. I made it exactly as directed and put the first waffle in to cook. I was a little concerned that there was no flavoring agents, since some of the reviews said it was bland. 

After tasting the first waffle, I added about a tablespoon of vanilla. The taste was better, but for the second waffle, I added about 1/4 cup of white sugar. The next waffle came out wonderful!

None of my waffles were crispy (but I'm sure that's because I didn't leave them in the griddle long enough, but that's actually what I prefer so that I can toast leftovers in the morning and have them not burn.

The waffles didn't even need syrup after I'd added the sugar. I took two triangles and made a sandwich with scrambled eggs and bacon--it tasted as good as, if not better, than a McD's mcgriddle sandwich, and I knew what was in it!

Followed the recipe and method exactly and these were really wonderful indeed! Next time I will sub half the AP flour with whole wheat. It's not everyday that I make waffles from scratch, so I don't mind all the work - it's part of the fun! Froze the leftover waffles. A+++

Great recipe.  Follow the directions and you will be happy with the result.  The egg whites must go in last to keep the waffles light in the inside rather than too dense.  Ready made waffles freeze well and can be popped into the toaster.

I love waffles but I would never make them because they never tasted right so I would stick to the frozen ones. Since my son is allergic to soy, frozen waffles are no longer an option and I tried these and I've made them several times and they are delicious every time.  This time I added 1tsp of vanilla extract which made a great recipe a little tastier.

flawless recipe my waffles came out light and fluffy and yet still nice and crispy on the outside the only thing that I changed was to put two tablespoons extra sugar as the first time I made them they were not sweet enough and I also added a teaspoon of vanilla essence to give it more taste otherwise wonderful recipe thanks.

The difference between waffles and pancakes is the testure.  These waffles turn out crunchy on the outside with a soft middle - so good.  I followed the recipe exactly as written but add bacon.  I cut bacon into pieces and cook 2/3 in the griddle then add the batter - about 1/2 slice per two waffle griddle.  These were the best waffles i've ever made.  I may add vanilla next time like some of the reviews suggest, but should I forget - won't miss it.  These are fantastic; follow the recipe directions.  The result is worth the fuss.

I give 5 starts for the ingredients, 4 starts for the ridiculous & unecessary directions.  I made this the first time as instructed and it made really good waffles.  I made this a second time by combining dry ingredients, then combining wet ingredients, then mixing them all tgether like most other recipes and the waffles are just as good, if not better - i think the 2nd time around they were actually crispier on the outer layer and just as soft inside.  Essentially don't bother with these silly, time consuming directions.  As a side note, i didn't have buttermilk so i substituted soy with about a TBSP or so of vinegar, I also added a splash of vanilla, a shake of cinnamon, and a dash more salt.

Made this recipe when we ran out of Belgian Waffle Mix...added 1 tsp almond extract and wild Maine blueberries.  We topped them with blueberries, blueberry syrup and whipped cream.  Light, fluffy, crispy on the outside.  Well worth the time!  :)

Easy to make. All natural. Or at least more than Bisquick! My kids loved it! We added about 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp (or less) cinnamon, and a bag of Nestle semi-sweet chocolate chips! Also made homemade whipped cream to top off! This is  new family favorite, and the recipe was so easy to follow!

I have made this recipe twice and found that I need to bake the waffles on a higher temperature that I usually do. Otherwise, they are sort of rubbery, even though they have folded in beaten egg whites.

Yummy!  For one of the cups of all-purpose flour I substituted whole wheat flour and I didn't have any buttermilk so I used 2 cups reg milk with 2 T white vinegar (add the vinegar and let the milk sit for 5-10 min).  Still good!

these are nice and tender waffles. you do have to beat the egg whites to get them fluffy but it not that big a deal....it did indeed take the 15 min total prep time as listed. I added a little vanilla since other posters seemed to think they need it...only added about 1/4 tsp and that was enough for us.

I too wanted these to be out of this world during all the odd preparation.  They were above good, but not excellent.  You must add vanilla for flavor, I added about 1/2 t but next time will add more.  They have an eggy flavor (which I loved), like pop-overs.  mmm.  With some tweaking of adding more flavor this recipe could be superb.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was a very good recipe.  Not great, but a good one.  I wish I could give it 4.5 stars.  It excelled in ease of preparation, taste and texture -- very light and tender.  Mine did not get as crispy as I expected, however,  I will definitely use the recipe again.  I did substitute freshly ground soft wheat for all-purpose flour as I do in almost all my cooking.  After reading some of the reviews in which reviewers stated that there wasn't much taste, I did add about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.    The outcome was a very tasty waffle.

I made this recipe gluten free by using Bob's Red Mill AP GF mix and 3/4 tsp xantham gum and they came out great.  The flavor is a little mild so I will add cinnamon or mini chocolate chips next time.  It made a large amount and they freeze well and heat easily in the toaster. I will definitely make these again.

The extra work was worth it for me. I didn't have buttermilk, so I just used regular milk - but the texture hits the nail on the head. Wonderful indeed.

Not so wonderful, is my opinion.  I really wanted these to be great, but unfortunately they were only so-so.  A lot of trouble for waffles that weren't even as good as the ones I usually make.

My batch was little thick so i added just little more of the buttermilk and it was great.  My kids just loved it! The batch was too much for our family so i would make half the serving next time.  Just what i wanted in a waffle, very yummy!!

I followed the recipe exactly.  They have nice texture but a bit eggy for my taste, and I agree with other reviewers that they don't have much flavor.  A lot of work, too.   My family enjoyed them enough, but I probably won't make again.

The texture of these came out great and our kids asked for more.  I do agree with a couple other comments though indicating they did not have much flavor.  I may follow another suggestion next time and add a bit more sugar.

This recipe was fabulous, although like other reviewers have mentioned its a lot of work for waffles.  I was out of buttermilk so I made buttermilk substitute with 2 tablespoons of vinegar and poured enough milk into the measuring cup to fill 2 cups atop the vinegar and let it sit for 10 minutes.  I assembled in a food processor.  Dry ingredients first (pulse a few times to make up for lack of sifting), creamed butter and sugar in small bowl, add egg yolks and butter to food processor & turn on & slowly pour in the "buttermilk" with a pinch of nutmeg. Fold the mixture into the bowl with the stiff egg whites.  Worked perfectly and tasted fantastic.  The fam was very pleased.

I agree, these are wonderful waffles. I was short on brown sugar, so used honey to sweeten.  I served with fresh blackberries and fresh peaches. Delicious!

the only change i made was to double the sugar since our kids don't put anything on their waffles, so i wanted to make sure they had enough flavor. the waffles were good, but i had trouble getting the outside crispy, despite cranking the temp on my waffle iron. these taste the same as the recipe i use that came with my waffle iron, which also separates the eggs.

good but not quite as spectacular as suggested by the other reviews.  I did not separate the eggs - i have made enough different waffles to know this is a texture primarily thing.  I also added 1 t. vanilla nd 1 t. almond per another reviewer and increased the butter and sugar by 50% by same reviewer.  Good.  smelled sweeter than they were - maybe that's a good thing, but I really did not taste the almond.

Used a similar recipe from another site. But wanted to put in my input from them. I'd rate it 5 stars as I made it. used 2 cup flour, 1.5 t baking powder, half cup butter melted, added 1t vanilla. All in all a great recipe. It made 11 waffles on my regular sized waffle iron, one or two is more than enough for each person. Yummy. Would also be good with some pecans thrown on top before cooking.

A very light, fluffy waffle recipe, but they do not stay crispy after they're removed from the iron.  However, they taste great and you can enjoy several without feeling like you've overeaten.

These were ok.  My kids liked them, but they are not our favorite. It was hard to determine the length of cooking time.  It seemed that I was pulling them out too early, or the were already burned.  Came out as a heavy waffle, we prefer something more airy.  Flavor was rather plain.

Have to admit that this is a very good recipe. —very moist and worth beating egg whites for!  I did change (thus the 4 stars) this:  I melted the butter and added to egg yolks and sugar (too lazy to cream!). Other reviewers said to add vanilla for taste so I added 1 tsp.  My buttermilk was homemade:  2% milk with apple cider vinegar.

My 19 year old son said these were the best. We used our Mickey waffle maker and traditional Belgian one. Sorry. I forgot to take a picture before the little kiddos gobbled them all up.

I don't understand why the recipe calls for 1/3 egg whites then the remaining 2/3 (why not all at once?), but the result was YUMMY. Highly recommended.

I made these waffles and did not think they were wonderful at all. The ‘classic waffle’ recipe I tried on Allrecipes the last time I made homemade waffles were way better but we’re not that great which is why I tried a new recipe this morning. I added a tsp of vanilla and a few shakes of cinnamon to the batter but these were still bland - bland - bland! They did not crisp up in the waffle iron either. The batter was really runny compared to the classic waffle recipe I have made from allrecipes and bisquick mixes. I am still looking for the right homemade waffle recipe because this is def not it

I made it completely as written, including whipping the egg whites, but I found the center of the waffle to be a bit too fluffy.  I think next time I may forego whipping the egg whites because I think it would be a bit denser if I did and it would hold up better.  Once we added even a little bit of syrup, the center was pretty mushy.  It did taste really good so I will definitely give it another try with the modification I stated before.

I searched waffle recipes and picked this one by chance.  Part way into it I was groaning that the recipe seemed like lots of work and was creating several dishes to wash.  The result was totally worth it!  My family loved them and declared them best waffles ever!  I will be making these again!

Easy and good. Substituted milk for the buttermilk. Did not separate eggwhites just added whole eggs and was great. Added a splash of vanilla for flavor.

Really good.  We loved it.  I doubled the recipe and added a bit extra brown sugar.  I separated the egg and folded in the egg whites.  I would think that it would be worth the effort to make them so light and fluffy.   Yummy.  If I am making waffles, I will put forth the effort.

Bad waffle recipe.  Cakey and heavy.  Had to keep adding milk to make them edible.  

I should have stopped when I saw it had only 1/4 cup of butter.

This is a great recipe! I didn't have buttermilk so I a just used milk with 2 tsp of lemon juice added. These are really light. I have a smaller waffle iron and ended up with 8 of these made. You must beat the eggs till they peak it's the best part and so worth it!

Excellent results, added 1/4 C oil to the batter to help with sticking on the waffle iron and improve moistness of the waffle.  It was a great flavor and I the whole group loved them, especially my waffle snob daughter.

Instead of separating the egg whites and egg yolks it was easier and made them taste better if you used normal eggs with no separating.

These waffles are light on the inside and crispy on the outside!  I made the recipe exactly as instructed and even though separating the eggs was a little time consuming, I think it yielded the lighter texture.  Next time I make these, I will definitely add vanilla.  I think it will add to the flavor, which was admittedly a little bland.  If you are looking for a buttermilk waffle recipe, this one is  a good one!

Tasted good, light and fluffy inside.  Made it exactly as the recipe shows.  Lacks a little on seasoning.  Could use another 1/2 teaspoon of salt for this size.  I will make these again.

Sounded so good but tasted like nothing. Should have read the others' review before I made them and I would have added vanilla...maybe almond? Also, even with doing the egg thing, seemed heavier than I had hoped

Worth the trouble of beating the egg whites; added a little vanilla extract. This will be a staple in our house  as they  feeeze so well as others already suggested.

Ohh the texture was absolutely great.  But do agree with another reviewer there was something missing.  Next I make these I will add some vanilla extra.  Thanks for sharing.

These are indeed wonderful waffles! They were very light and fluffy and taste great. I did add 1/4 cup of white sugar in addition to the brown sugar, as well as 1 tsp of vanilla extract. This recipe makes plenty of waffles. I was able to use some for a chicken and waffles dinner, some for breakfast, some I made and put in the freezer,  and I still had some batter left. This will definitely be my go to recipe for waffles.

I love this recipe! Only 1/4 cup butter in this one, which is much more reasonable (I find most waffle recipes have an appalling amount of butter in them - 1 cup or more for the same amount of batter!). I tweaked this recipe a bit - I did 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup spelt flour, 1/4 cup quinoa flour. I also added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ginger, as well as 1 cup pumpkin (subbed for some of the liquid). I didn't have enough buttermilk (about 2/3 cup) so I topped up with regular milk. They turned out great!! A little more healthy and flavourful than the original, and my kids LOVED them!

Crispy outside, fluffy inside. Worth the extra time to separate the eggs, etc. I added 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla and a generous pinch of cinnamon. They could have been a little sweeter. The waffle itself becomes all about the texture as it doesn't have very much flavor. My kids loved them and until I find something better this will be my go to recipe. The recipe made 10 ~ 7" round waffles. Four served as breakfast and another six went into the freezer. Make sure you freeze them on a cookie sheet then transfer them to a freezer bag once they are hard, otherwise they will squish and you will have frozen pancakes and not waffles.

great recipe. I followed it to the T, minus the buttermilk, being as I didn't have any. I used 2 cups of whole milk and a half a lemon (juiced) to create my own buttermilk. Not sure how much that changed the flavor of the finished product, but they were delicious just the same.

These turned out great! I didn't have buttermilk so had to substitute with 1 cup 2% and 1 cup almond milk. That's all I had handy. I will try again with buttermilk. Thanks for the recipe :)!

This was so good!! I was looking for a great recipe to freeze so I made this for my kids this morning and they pretty much cleaned their plates. My son said, Mommy, I know. Why don't you just make these and freeze them so we won't have to buy the ones from the store? Yes, good idea!

As the other reviewers have said, the texture is perfect. While it's a bit work to separate the eggs and beat the egg whites, I do think that's an essential step to get the batter that perfect "fluffiness." Don't skip it.

This recipe is pretty good. Extra steps don't scare me away.  I am a mom to 4 kids and usually decide to make things on a whim...rather, when they ask me I look up and make.  My electric mixer situation is pathetic (kitchen-aid needs repairing, hand mixer only has one beater!) and I didn't think these took a crazy amount of time at all.  FlavEor was pretty good I'd say, not the absolute best but good. I did add vanilla.  One thing I will say, they seem to take longer to cook if you want them crispy.  Longer than the waffle iron seems to sense.  If you want them crispy and your waffle iron is still steaming, let it go longer. Evan if the waffle iron says its done, if it's still steaming they will be soft.  Thanks for the recipe.

By far the best recipe I have tried-I will admit I used white sugar as I am out of brown for the moment, and I added about a tsp. of vanilla but I don't believe those two things changed the recipe for the better-just made it a little different. This one might actually just get TAPED to the waffle iron! :) TY for posting!!!

I thought these waffles had great flavor, but mine didn't come out crispy.  I've been trying to find a recipe crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  I'm starting to think it's my waffle maker.  I have a square waffle iron that doesn't flip so it's a challenge to get waffles to cook evenly.

Light and flavorful, probably the best waffle recipe I've ever tried. I made a big batch and froze the extras - they served up well weeks later. Best for brunch as they take a little extra time but SO worth it.

I agree it could use a TOUCH more sugar (I don't put a lot of syrup on my waffles) ... but the exterior crunch, color, and tenderness inside can't be beat.

I've made these three times now and they have come out consistently every time. They are perfect in my opinion - crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. My kids keep begging me to make them instead of pancakes! They are quite filling so we stash the extras (this recipe makes approximately 8 waffles with my waffle maker) in a freezer bag and the kids eat them up for breakfast over the week. And no, these are not "quick" waffles but the egg whites do make them super crunchy and light so I find the extra time spent separating and beating the egg whites are well worth the investment.

Followed the recipe as written.  Waffles turned out great but a little plain.  I think next time I will add blueberries or chocolate chips to give them a kick of flavor.  Great base recipe to build on though.

I didn't bother with whipping the whites and all that...I just stuck everything in a bowl and whisked it till smooth. I did have to add an additional 1/4 c flour to get the consistency right. But these cook up fluffy and crisp on the outside! YUM!

Good texture.  Not strong on flavor, but I will use this recipe again in the future and probably add vanilla or something to give that little bit extra...

I am giving this recipe only 2 stars because in the words of my son..."what is different?"  All that effort didn't produce a waffle better than our regular recipe.

These tasted very good.  My whole family enjoyed them.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was easy to make.  Mine didn't come out as crispy on the outside as some of the other reviewers mentioned.  Mine fell limp, but it could just be because of the settings on my waffle iron.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Very nice recipe.  Closest to "Good Night Waffles" I've found without making them the night before.  I sifted all dry ingredients together in large bowl, mixed all wet ingredients together in a bowl - eggs whole - and dumped wet into dry.  Added cinnamon, 3 tspns yeast, and vanilla.  Waited 30 minutes for yeast to "bloom", then to the waffle iron.  Very tasty indeed.

I made these this morning for our Sunday breakfast because I ran out of my box mix.  My husband and son both agreed this recipe is a "Keeper."  I will no longer be using a box mix for waffles.  These were great.  I creamed the butter and brown sugar together, blended in the eggs and then just stirred in the dry ingredients.  I did not sift the dry ingredients though maybe they would have been even better if I had.  In any case, these waffles were very good.

I had only chocolate flavored almond milk in my fridge, and did a substitution.  They turned out really good.

Loved this recipe, they are wonderful!  Make as the recipe states, use real maple syrup, and top with fresh blueberries, can't go wrong with this one!

I actually whipped the egg whites first in one bowl, then mixed all the other ingredients in another bowl. (this way, i had clean beaters for the egg whites, and didn't have to wash the beaters in between mixes) Then folded everything together. Not much more work. Really yummy. But definitely add some sugar and vanilla!

We really liked this recipe. I Got a new waffle iron and was looking for good, basic recipe.  This one has a good, waffle not pancake texture I was looking for.  Puffed up nicely.  Added 1 teaspoon vanilla and melted the butter.  I think a dash of salt too.  Really not that time consuming.  Awesome waffle for topping with fruit.  Really enjoyed, thanks!

These are an "okay" waffle.  There are other waffle recipes out there that are less work-intensive and produce a better waffle, so I don't think I will be making these again.

Excellent texture and overall a superb waffle. I am pretty picky and these are good.  I would probably only use two eggs next time and-like many suggestions--I liked a little extra flavor (strawberries for me and choc chips for my sons)  Great recipe.

These are a bit of work.  I couldnt get the crispy/soft texture right when cooking.  Two and a half minutes was about right for my electric waffle maker. My daughter had them Christmas morning with ice cream and chocolate sauce and whipped cream on them. What a Christmas treat for a little girl!!

These turned out pretty good. Someone said they were flavorless, so I added a few dashes of Saigon cinnamon and a tiny bit of nutmeg to the batter. It smelled wonderful! And the taste was good too...though I'd say it could have been sweeter. Next time, I'll add perhaps a couple more tablespoons of sugar.

Like other people I couldn't be bothered to mix and separately and I combined all the ingredients.  It turned out fine.

Very good recipe.  Crispy on the outside - soft on the inside.  Everyone enjoyed them.  They required a little extra prep but well worth it.

These were good.  A little more time consuming than some of the other waffles I have made but good.  Be careful about cooking time, although I cooked them until iron said it was done, I felt that some of mine were a little overcooked.
