Excellent and easily the richest roasted chicken dish I have ever had. What makes this dish is the bread that sits under the roasting chicken. I could eat that alone, but I think I would die from acute gout :) I had no fresh thyme, so I subbed a tablespoon of dry thyme. I could not find Aleppo peppers at my market so I just skipped that entirely. Other than that, made this to a "T" and it was a hit. I put cut up red potatoes around the bird at the start and brushed them with the excess olive oil. Served it along with a wonderful Chardonnay and stuffed eggplant..... YUM!!!!! Thanks for making us feel like millionaires for a night Chef John!

I'm glad Mauigirl posted that she could not find nor did she use the Aleppo pepper.  A substitute could have been used but was not.  It is good to know that a simple teaspoon of the pepper did not make or break this terrific looking and sounding chicken.  I do not know what an Aleppo pepper is or where to find it.  I too will be leaving it out.  I am sure dried Thyme was not an issue either. Sometimes we just have to go with what we know and have on hand.  Thank you Mauigirl for your post.

Aleppo pepper dark red pepper similar to paprika!
•Deliciously deep, aromatic flavor with versatile use.
•Delicious on grilled meat-- chicken, steak, and chops.
•Perfect in chilli, meat loaf, and sauces!

I have not tried this recipe but plan on doing so and plan on cooking it exactly as directed; then I will rate it.  How Mauigirl can you rate something that you did not even cook per the ingredients and instructions.........sheeeeeeesh, people please don't rate something you haven't even tried and substituted ingredients.

I've made this four times and haven't been impressed. I followed the recipe exactly; I even special ordered Aleppo pepper and made Chef John's Creme Fraiche (which is excellent). In the end, the flavor just isn't there. Tips for if you do make it: make sure your bread slices are at least 1" thick.  Cook at lower temp (425 or less) to minimize bread burning. Don't over baste; three times is plenty.

Smitty - use french or Italian bread, for goodness sake - you won't make it because of a small thing your hubbie doesn't like?  He wouldn't even be able to tell because of the yummy juices it absorbs!! I used chicken breasts,some grilled red peppers from a jar, made my own creme fraiche from this site.  SO good!!

I made this recipe immediately because I loved the video and it was very easy.  I made exactly the way Chef John did, but because I didn't have the Aleppo pepper, I used his substitute for it.  By the way, I did order the special Turkish pepper from Amazon and it is amazing!  This chicken dish is one of the best I've ever had, in fact, my son said it was his now all time favorite.  You can't stop eating it, it's so delicious! I sent the video to everyone I knew because it was so good.  I doubled the creme fraiche recipe because I wanted to make sure I had enough sauce for all the chicken.  It truly is one of my favorite chicken dishes!

Made the crème fraîche from scratch using heavy cooking cream (35%) and buttermilk, kept in a warm spot. Also, mixed paprika & chill pepper. 

It looked great, and was delicious. I added another clove or 2 of garlic; used sliced sourdough baguette, but that's it. I will definitely make it again..and again!

i found the bread got wayyyy tooo black, I watched the video and Chef John said it would be dark coloured but my bread was much more charred and I had to trim of the burnt part.I am trying to think of what a person could do to prevent it getting this black. I did use thinker pieces of bread which at least allowed me to trim. I mixed 1 t. of sweet paprika (or smoked paprika) with 1/4 t. of cayenne in place of the Aleppo pepper. I also needed to roast it an additional 15 mins. It was good but not quite the "great I expected." By the way, luv Chef John and his humour.

Just curious. Why the bread at the bottom? Any reason behind it?? Because as you say in your video, it got burned. But all the cream that got soaked in it, made it amazing. Why not just toast it and add it in the final 20 mins when the cream is added. Thanks.

The sauce made the chicken and bread so flavorful.  I first cooked the chicken at 400 degrees based on some of the reviews and that temperature got the bread brown without charring it too much. I then upped the temperature to 450 for the sauce applications. The chicken was perfectly juicy and the bread was excellent. I served a salad topped with a bright mustard dressing on the side to help cut through the richness of the main dish. Perfection!

OMG. Yum. So I made this chicken for Christmas dinner and it was crisp and moist. I did make a few changes based on other reviews. I marinated overnight and cooked at a lower temp 375 and finished on 450 to crisp up the skin. The bread did not burn it is crispy and flavor full like the chicken. The bread is just like having the perfect amount of stuffing, but only better. I gave each guest a little piece of bread with the chicken.

I used leg quarters and put bread under every piece of chicken. Also,the bread went up the side of the roasting pan. Used creme fraiche.  It turned out GREAT!!! Was not difficult.  Cooked a little longer then the recipe calls for probably due to increased surface area of the chicken.  Also flipped it to ensure both sides would cool.  Kept watching to prevent burning.  Simply delicious!!!!!

Disclaimer: I did not make the recipe yet. It sounds yummy like it would be a five stars though!  I  wanted to make sure I have the ingredients.   I just wanted to add what I found on a search for Aleppo Pepper:

The proper proportion for the best alternative to Aleppo pepper: Mix four parts sweet paprika to one part cayenne. Optional: Add a tiny pinch of salt.

Wasn't  impressed at all!!  450 was way too hot!  Even at 375 the bread was totally burnt and greasy!!  Didn't much care for the flavor either!!  Was just a real greasy mess and hard to clean up.  Won't be making it again for sure!!

Made this again for Thanksgiving today and it came out great as usual! This chicken in full of flavor! I have made this with a whole chicken and it's delicious, but since I was cooking for just one, this time I decided to give it a try with boneless chicken breast. To get that nice browning on the skin, I seared it off quickly on both sides first in the pan and then transferred it to a baking dish to roast in the oven. I placed all of the other ingredients on top/below chicken for aromatics- with the bread below. Unfortunately, I still haven't mastered the bread technique and mine came out too burnt for me to consume. I basted the chicken with the creme fraiche/aleppo pepper mixture twice during the roasting process and this process still worked in keeping the chicken breast moist. I've never used aleppo pepper before this recipe and it does add a really nice spice to the chicken. After it was done, I topped it off with some roasted gravy and it turned out to work very well with my Thanksgiving sides. I will continue to make this again!

No creme fraiche around here, so I used Mexican creme. The chicken was perfectly roasted and tasty, but I'm not convinced the basting added that much flavor. I must have sliced the bread too thin (1/2 inch?) and it was way too burned to eat comfortably. I would advise an inch thick slice. Doubt I will try this again. Very hard to improve on a simple roast chicken!

I have made this several times, and yes, it is rich and incredibly delious, but it is a recipe from the 
standard Grille in NYC.  Right down to the brand of pepper.

Best  turkey breast I've ever had. Yeah, I used turkey because I prefer it to chicken (also replaced the shallot with garlic for the same reason) but same concept. It was so delicious I can't even describe it. I'm cooking every meat over bread from now on, just in the hope that it's half as yummy as this was.

Wow! Made this chicken for dinner tonight, and got rave reviews. Absolutely wonderful recipe. Went all over the place to find aleppo pepper without success, so had to sub with a teaspoon of Just Cook's ancho chicken rub. Other than that followed recipe to a T. The chicken was so moist and flavorful, the bread was awesome! The flavor profiles of this dish were unlike any other roasted chicken  I have eaten. Absolutely loved every single bite! Thank you chef John for another winning recipe!

Found it very tasty but not mind blowing... I think next time I would add some sage and perhaps even rosemary to the Creme to give it a bit more dimension.  The bread was tasty underneath and the stuffed chicken turned out spot on... Really a good dish, but I just expected a bit more wow from the tangy Creme fraishe sauce.... But found it rather one-note.  Gonna season it up a notch next time and see what I can do to bring it up one note.

I followed the directions EXACTLY, but the bread was badly burned on the outside, and then saturated with congealed chicken fat on the inside. 

I LOVED how the sauce made the chicken so golden brown, and the taste on the chicken was fabulous, but I thought the reduced sauce was just too rich for my taste.   

I'm glad I made it.

This turned out amazing! It was also a fairly low maintenance recipe. My only critique is that the bread does burn and it made my kitchen smokey through the entire bake process. However, the bread is delicious, even when burned. I may try it with oven on 425 next time to see if that makes a difference. Will be making this again in the future!

No changes.  Bread was a bit "over brown" on the down side.  Should turn it over before the 1hr mark. Otherwise it was good.

I feel this recipe adds a lot of work and hard to find ingredients to simple roast chicken with herbs. I spent too much time looking for crème fraiche and alleppo pepper, of which my major grocer had neither. I looked up substitutes after the unsuccessful search and had all the recommended items. A chef should know when items can be hard to find and offer options or substitutions. Even then for the extra effort, I don't think the dish is exceptional. I gave it 3 stars for the wasted effort I had to put in to try it. Maybe closer to $10 chicken than $1 million.

" some of the greatest meals ever concocted were because somebody didn't have the accepted ingredients".-  me, 2016.  Gave me reason to go out and kick the snow of the herb garden for some late season thyme.  Used cabeata bread  cuz that's what I had and yes some of it got dark.  Even the black bread was good and didn't taste burnt.  Bread under bird was amazing as predicted.  I Added a jar of tiny mixed Greek olives, pits and all, to the cavity which when spooned out over when serving seemed brillant.  No  fancy cream in these parts so I added Half and half to sour cream along with some  minced dried summer  chilles ,a tablespoon Everdae habenaro sauce which is sweet, a little white wine and a few shakes of slap your momma salt to the other ingredients For a great sauce. I did have the Mauldron salt flakes and they were the finishing touch to a simple yet sophisticated dish.

I made this mostly as directed, with the only exception using smoked paprika and red pepper flakes (1/2 tsp each) for the aleppo.  I also thought the blackish bread wouldn't be good, but it was amazing.  Chicken was super moist and delicious.

The temp is too high. Be careful lifting the chicken to turn the bread (which will be burnt to a crisp after one hour at 425) as the juices in the cavity splatter all over.

I too, couldn't find Aleppo pepper, so had to leave it out. Used dried thyme as well, as couldn't find fresh. I used my homemade creme fraiche too. This chicken was fabulous!!! And the bread was OMG YUMMY!! I can't wait to find fresh thyme & the pepper, and make this again!!!

Just made this and it is excellent!  I did not have the Aleppo pepper, but the internet said it's between an Ancho pepper and paprika, so I put in a few red pepper flakes and some cumin and the tsp of paprika.  Hubby likes his food spicy which is why I added the few red pepper flakes, it had the perfect spice for him.  I had the thinner cut bread so I used two pieces one on the other instead of one thicker piece and this worked just fine.  My hubby works at a labor intensive job so this worked for him, but I had to limit myself to the meat, otherwise it would not be good for my pants, but whew!  This is tasty.  Thank you for the recipe. :)

Aleppo pepper is a Turkish crushed chili has an ancho-like flavor with a little
more heat and tartness.  It's not so easy to find but definitely worth it to go out of your way.  I order mine from penzy's spices online.  I am definitely trying this recipe, it sounds divine!

I am surprised not more folks gave this recipe 5 stars.  I just made it again last night (this is about the 5th time I've made it) and just ate the leftovers for lunch.  Just heating it up had several of my colleagues clamoring at my office door asking where all those wonderful smells were coming from.  It is a fabulous dish and not technically difficult at all.  John notes he uses 3 pieces of bread instead of 2.  I use FOUR!  More bread.  The bread is FABULOUS.  I recommend using fresh sourdough rather than old french.

I made this for a family dinner.  I cooked two chickens side by side in a big roasting pan.  I followed the instructions except for in the creme fraiche sauce.  I did not have shallots so I used a little grated onion and I subbed a bit of ancho chili powder for the special pepper.  That said, the bread was pretty black, but I went with it.  I HATE burnt anything, but the flavor of the bread with the tender, delicious chicken and juices was wonderful, not burnt.  My family gamely tried it and ended up loving it.  My cousin called it deconstructed stuffing.  I did need to cook it a bit longer because of the two chickens together.  I might try reducing the temp next time or putting the bread in a little later so it won't be quite as black, but honestly I was happy and surprised that it tasted so good just as it was.

Fantastic, followed the recipe exactly however we do not have a flat roasting pan however it works well with a ribbed one.  In the future we would cut down on the lemon, it was a little overpowering.

Really good, there was quite a lot of the creme fraich  left over, I would only use 1/2 cup next time.
I might try just using chicken breast and thighs ( skin on) next time, just put the lemon and spices underneath.

I made this without the pepper. The chicken was moist, skin crispy, but I really wasn't into the glaze. Maybe to much lemon, I don't know. The bread, so so.  The chicken itself was good though.

I made this chicken recipe as written. I used all the crème fraise sauce on the bird in the oven. the toast was more than "brown",, but we still ate it and enjoyed it. the chicken has a very interesting flavor, but million dollar, not really.

I made this but I used bone in chicken breasts on their own individual pieces of bread. I could not find the aleppo pepper so I used red pepper flakes and some chilie powder in the cream, it was delicious and everyone liked the individual breasts with bread.

Loved the chicken and would cook it this way again, however did not like the bread . You could taste the olive oil. So next time I will stuff the chicken with the bread.
