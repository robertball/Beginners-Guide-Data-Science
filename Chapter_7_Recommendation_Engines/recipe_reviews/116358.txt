Five stars for being easy and uncomplicated as well as delicious - not to mention that this comes together in less than half an hour.  Didn't bother to measure, just dumped in ingredients in amounts that suited me. In addition to the chicken broth I gave the sauce a couple of glugs of dry white wine - Chardonnay to be exact, and used fresh rosemary.  For tender and juicy meat, watch cooking time carefully; I found the submitter's directions to be really accurate. I served this with baked acorn squash and "Herbed Mashed Potatoes," also from this site. This was the perfect autumn meal.

I didn't have any savory, but the gravy and pork were delicious without it.  This would be good with pork chops too.  Next time, I'd double the sauce ingredients because there wasn't much gravy for our mashed potatoes.

I have to say that this is one of the best pork tenderloin recipes I have used.  I went with poultry seasoning in place of what was listed and went with 1/3 cup chicken broth.  After placing the pork back in the mixture, I turned the heat down to low and left it covered for 30 to 40 minutes.  Very tender.

Yum - although I have to laugh because I've been making this for years - I saute onions and mushrooms in butter, remove them from the pan then brown my seasoned pork chops in the butter glaze left in the pan and then scoop the mushrooms and onions back onto the chops.
 Then - and yes you will all spit your coffee - mix one can cream of mushroom soup, and fill/clean out the can with white wine and a splash of Kitchen Bouquet together, pour over the chops, cover and simmer for about an hour. The chops are delicious and the wine makes them fork tender.  My husband and 3 sons devour them over noodles. All of my sons are now out and on their own and this is a quick, delicious, no fuss taste of home they can make after a busy day at work. When my oldest was in law school he adapted it for his Crock Pot so it was ready when he came home.

Yep, cream of mushroom soup - scoff away.

Yum!  I once made a recipe like this out of a magazine and have been searching everywhere to find it again.  This is SO good - one of my favorite meals, and there's a ton of flavor.  Be careful not to use too much flower or let the flower/broth mixture boil too long or it gets too thick and isn't as good.  But overall -delicious!

i made a few changes starting w/ using about 1.5 lbs of pork cutlets, 8 oz of mushrooms, double the seasoning, 2.5 tbs of flour, and about 1.5 c of chicken broth. Other than the fact that my cutlets were just a little chewy(i was in a hurry), it was really good. The whole family loved it. I would make that gravy w/ any kind of pork.

Fast, super easy and delicious!  I used this recipe as a jumping off place and used some suggestions made by other reviewers and we ended up with a wonderful dinner.  I used more mushrooms – 4 oz.  I doubled the sauce along with all the seasonings, except the salt.  And I omitted the savory because I didn’t have any.  Instead of just chicken broth, I used half broth and half dry white wine.  I cooked my medallions completely in the pan and removed them to a warm oven.  Then made the sauce and dinner was done in no time!  No need to return the medallions to the pan and simmer for 15 minutes.  That’s the beauty of pork tenderloin; they’re already a very tender cut of meat.  I also richened my sauce with about 1 teaspoon of browning and seasoning sauce, which produced a dark, rich, beautiful sauce.

YUMMMMMMMY!!!!  This was excellent.  The only thing I added was about 1/2 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 because I wanted to get rid of it.

Delicious!  The medallions were melt in your mouth!  I will be making this again!

I had left overs and the next day I made some noodles and poured it over the noodles and it was wonderful!

Wow... absolutely amazing!  I did double the sauce to serve over rice on the side.  Wasn't a lot of extra, but it tasted absolutely amazing.  I used dried porcini mushrooms because it was all I had on hand and they worked just fine.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

So far I'm in the minority.

After reading the reviews, I expected something close to spectacular, but this was just...very ok. It was bland, though I must say the pork itself was wonderfully tender.

But I don't know what I could have done to add more flavor.

Full disclosure: rather than risk having leftover chicken broth/stock to have to use up or pitch, I used a dry white wine (pinot grigio). If anything, I think that helped.

Thanks anyway, but I won't make this again. There are too many other great pork recipes.

Very, very good.  I found a similar recipe on Rachael Ray, but was looking for something just a tid bit more more easy.  The only thing I changed (per other people that posted here) is that I made more sauce and used a white wine to get to a more marsala flavor.  I also didn't have any savory.  I added two springs of fresh rosemary which gave it an outstanding flavor.  I served it over fettuccine.  Every single person in the house gave the "compliments to the chef."  Wow!  It was so easy, the pork loin was buy one get one free, so the meal was cheap.  I made a tomato/cucumber salad on the side that accented the dish perfectly.  This will definitely be on my rotation list.

We enjoyed this. I doubled the sauce and used 8oz of sliced mushroom. I subbed thyme for the savory as that's what I had. I'll make this again!

This is a great recipe which I'm sure is tasty on its own, but I tweaked it just a bit, and that, as Emeril would say, kicked it up a notch.  First, I pounded the medallions to make them just a bit thinner, and dredged them in flour, salt, and pepper before sauteeing.  This resulted in a subtle crust and additional texture and flavor.  I also added an 8 oz pack of sliced mushrooms rather than just 1/4 cup.  And, I added a bit of white wine to the sauce, and replaced the savory with thyme.  YUM!  The same recipe could easily be made with chicken.  This is great served over rice.

This was a great recipe.  I grew a lot of herbs over the summer and had dried some to use over the winter.  If you're using winter savory you'll want to add a pinch more near the end as the flavor can disappear if it's cooked in heat for too long.

Am I the only one who is frustrated that you can't by a single pork tenderloin and that they are almost always sold in pairs?  That's a lot of pork for two people!  I used boneless pork loin chops instead and doubled the sauce recipe.  It was really good!  I think if maybe the meat was crusted that the texture would make it 5 stars. The house smelled like a restaurant kitchen!

This is a real basic, simple, and easy to put together pork recipe. The ingredients are all really basic things that most people have on hand, so I recommend that you try this. I did make a modification, though...I had no fresh mushrooms around, as my family doesn't care for them, so I omitted them from the recipe. The only problem I had with the finished pork was that it came out rather salty; this was probably because I didn't put in the mushrooms. Altogether, I found this very easy and quick to make; it came together in less than half an hour. I'd make it again, so thanks for sharing!

Made mostly per recipe.  Salted and peppered the pork, than dreddged in flour.  Doubled the mushrooms and garlic.  Used almost a whole can of chx broth.  Added a healthy dash of sherry to sauce before serving.  Very yummy.  My husband loved it and my 15 year old daughter ate the left overs the next day.  Might use shallots instead of onion next time.  Thanks!

I used fresh rosemary and added a splash of sherry wine at the end. I also recommend doubling the amount of mushrooms. It was absolutely delish! Went well with the herbed mashed potatoes I served alongside the pork (used rosemary, parsley, sour cream, butter, garlic, and a splash of milk with red potatoes and smashed with a fork). Yum!

Followed the recipe exactly except for a splash more chicken stock to eek out more sauce. Awesome. Even my picky eater liked it!

I just made this for my wife and she loved it.  This is a high-end restaurant quality recipe.  I made a couple of modifications.  I did not have pork tenderloin, so I butterflied two pork chops, quartered them, and pounded thin to make medallions.  I dredged the medallions in flour before browning them.  I used porcini mushrooms and added a 1/4 of white whine in addition to the chicken broth.  I simmered for about 30 min instead of 15 min and the meat was tender.  Perfect dish; A+.

Excellent, easy receipe! Everyone in my family enjoys this one and that is saying alot. I suggest having all ingredients measured out and on hand as the timing is quick and crucial, especially for the delicious sauce.

Very simple yet good. I didn't realize my potatoes had gone bad so when I got home and planned to make this, I ended up having to use rice but it actually worked out really well with this recipe. I added one full cup of chicken broth instead of a 1/2 cup and I skipped the salt. Great quick week night recipe!

This was very yummy. I did have to increase ingredients to make more of the tasty gravy. This recipe is one I am gonna make over and over again!

I did not have any savory, so used a little thyme instead.  I did not make potatoes with it this time, but I definitely will next time.  It would be a perfect compliment to the meat and gravy.

This is an excellent recipe.  the only reason I gave it four stars is because of the additions I made. but isn't that the beauty of a great recipe?  I used pork loin cut very thin because it is so much cheaper that a tenderloin.  I doubled the recipe for the sauce and added a T of worcestershire sauce to give it a little darker color and deepen the flavors.  I also did not have savory but had thyme in the garden so used that and fresh rosemary instead.

I recommend substituting sage for the savory if you don't have any, and add some green and red peppers while pork is cooking (with the sauce). Then your veg factor is covered.

My first try at pork tenderloin and it was a total hit! I didn't change anything and it turned out marvelous, even my 5 year old couldn't get enough!

On my second try with this recipe, instead of using sliced onions, I used green onions. Turned out just as marvelous :-)

Made as written, omitting mushroom and onion because I didn't have them in the pantry.  I'm sure this would have tasted even better, but it was delicious without the onion/mushroom.  The kids ate it up, even my picky eater who doesn't like gravy.  Served over plain angel hair pasta.  This will definitely be added to the monthly menu rotation!

We aren't big pork eaters but this recipe could just about change that. The flavor is excellant and the meat is so moist and tender. This is a recipe that will be made again.

We were not impressed at all. I was expecting something better with all of the wonderful reviews. The pork was very tender but very, very bland; even with all of the spices. Adding more flavor is something that can be worked with, but as the recipe is I would not make it again.

This was pretty good but maybe the pork would've been more interesting if it had been breaded and fried making is crusty or something...flavor was pretty good and nice on mashed pierogies and cabbage...

A keeper.  I followed the recipe except I had no savory on hand.  This was very good.  Next time I will double up on the sauce, and I will increase the amount of garlic. A quick meal that makes a nice presentation.

Made this the other night and it was fantastic!  I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used canned portebellas.  No dried rosemary but I did have fresh ... I used about a 1/4" piece and then removed it.  I also added about a 1/4 cup of white wine to the sauce for simmering.  Fabulous!  We are actually going to make this for Christmas dinner rather than our traditional prime rib roast!

wow, awesome recipe to change up my old routine on boneless pork loin chops.  made basically as directed, took a few suggestions from reviews,since i too did not have savory.  I didn't get to add wine (white or marsala) as i had planned from one of the reviews but i did switch to the shallots and doubled up on the broth, garlic and used fresh rosemary.  Pork was tender gravy was very flavorful.  As with any recipe, use them as a guide and season to your own personal taste.  I think that where some of the reviews went astray.  Thanks for posting will be making this again and probably trying some new tidbits then too, as always.  enjoy!!

Awesome. Tweaked as follows:I used green and red pepers in place of the mushrooms...love shrooms just didn't have any. Sautued onion and peppers first in oil then browned the floured medallions in same pan, added Marsala wine to the sauce and BOOM what a meal.
Thanks Donald.

Loved the taste and simplicity of this recipe.  I added a 1/4 C. of white wine to deglaze after the roux was complete and a spash of half and half at the end.  Didn't have any savory.

Excellent and easy recipe. Next time, however, I will season the meat with salt and pepper before sauté it. I added a little more mushrooms and put 1/8 cup of dry white wine with the chicken broth. My husband loved it. Definitely, I will make this dish again!

Pork wasn't hugely tender, but I could have overcooked it. The sauce was nice - my kids loved it.  Served with roasted asparagus and a sweet potato. Will try again and hope for slightly better results.

I cannot figure out what I liked better about this recipe....the ease of making it or the taste! I have added this to my recipe box and will be making it again. I did add a little more chicken broth to it after I returned the medallions to the pan just to create a little more gravy. I served it with a salad topped with a mixture of dijon mustard and raspberry vinaigrette dressing and gnocchi.

I decided to cook this last minute when I found it on the site.I was so tired of fried pork so this was what I was looking for. My family really enjoyed this..I omitted mushrooms from lack of having them. I didnt change anything else. They were really good and my picky son decided to try a bite and ended up eating a whole one.

Yum.  I thought this was a great recipe.  I didn't have any savory but the flavor was still delish.  I did add a touch more chicken broth for extra gravy.

Mmmm, so good!  Really liked this recipe - it was fast and easy - great for a weeknight dinner.  I did increase the mushrooms (because we love them)but kept everything else the same.  I reduced the simmering time of the pork to 10 minutes and that was still a little much.  Pork tenderloin cut into 1/2" medallions do not take long to cook.  Next time I will double the sauce because it's so good and there wasn't quite enough.  The flavors in this are are wonderful.  Thanks for sharing Donald!

This broth is FABULOUS!  I served it in little bowls on the side as well and we dipped everything on our plate in it!  I can't believe how flavorful it was.  Will definitely make again!

The only change I made to the recipe was to use fresh rosemary instead of dried. My family found this recipe to be somewhat bland. Easy but ordinary.

Very nice way to prepare pork.  The meat was so tender.  I agree with a few other reviewers that this recipe is easy to modify to your own tastes and/or what you have on hand.  You can also let the pork cook a little longer than suggested if covered and on a low heat and the meat will be even more tender.  I served it over herbed mashed potatoes and the whole family liked it.  It will definitely stay in my recipe book and be used again.  Thanks for sharing!

I stuck to the recipe except substituted a little on the spices. This was a really great recipe! Quick and easy with flavor that says you spent a lot of time and effort on it! It would be a great company dinner with polenta or mashed potatoes.

This recipe was exceptional... a very unique taste!  I always try to make recipes as directed without reading the comments in the ratings section first...so I pretty much made this as directed although I gave up on the savory after visiting three different stores.  I added a pinch more of the rosemary instead.  I did salt and pepper the pork before cooking as I have a habit of doing.  I couldn't help but add more mushrooms and I'm always a little heavy handed on the garlic.  I found I needed to add probably twice the chicken broth during the cooking.  I did not dredge the flour and the sauce came out perfect.  I was concerned about the liquid becoming too thick when cooking the pork an additional 15 minutes but it didn't and the whole thing came out perfect.  I would agree with another rater that you should measure out your ingredients ahead of time because the timeing is quick.  Definitely a keeper!!

Solid dish, Donald.  My family enjoyed my version which utilized red wine to deglaze and fresh herbs (growing in the backyard).  I enjoyed several reviewer's suggestion to roll in seasoned flour before browning, but I disagree with Cheryl on her interpretation.  I can totally appreciate your nostalgia, sister, but your suggested version with mushroom soup and white wine was...bland.  My kids would eat it, which you mentioned, but my wife and I were like..."eh?".

I REALLY liked this. My husband did too. It got the full five stars because it was so easy. I was worried at the point before the medallions went back in because it seemed like it needed more liquid, but in the end it was perfect. So glad I didn't add more. I served it over rice and it was great.

I loved this recipe!  I used Poultry seasoning instead of Savory.  Next time I would add more seasoning and more salt - it was a little bland until I added seasoning at the end. My 9 year old even liked it after I added more seasoning. My gravy was a little thin - I'll try cooking a little longer next time.  Thanks for the tips, including doubling the gravy.

Wonderful. Delicious. Easy. Yum. I sprinkled the pork with season all and browned it in butter. I used a dry packet of onion/mushroom soup instead of fresh and just mixed it in with the flour. I didn't have savory so I used some thyme. I used some chicken bullion granules and doubled the water so this could simmer longer as I had rice in the oven that was going to be awhile. Excellent flavor, we all loved this. What a great comfort dish!

This was great! I used country style ribs and cooked it the same way and it turned out yummy. I didnt have any savory either and used frozen mushrooms, but it was great tasting with stuffing and green beans. Thank you

Absolutely wonderful!  The first time I made this recipe, the only thing I changes was that I substituted thyme for savory (didn't have any).  I doubled the broth for more gravy.  The third time I made this recipe, I added about 1/3 cup plain yogurt just before serving and it was equally wonderful.  I served it for my bridge luncheon and got rave reviews.

The gravy was very flavorful, but the pork was not as tender as I was expecting.  I followed the directions and the pork was a little tough.

Delicious and easy to cook! What else can you ask for? ready in 25 to 30 minutes, no need to marinate the pork which makes it even easier, followed the instructions to the letter except for using half chicken broth, half white wine, had run out of savory so I skipped that, yet still came out delicious, paired it with white jasmine rice, cheesy mash potatoes (my own recipe) and a greek salad, I do suggest you stick to regular mushrooms instead of the portabella since the latter will give the sauce a darker shade to it, really only affecting the presentation of the dish, however which ever one you decide to use will make this a unique and quick meal to put on your table any day of the week, enjoy!

I made this for my family and it went over very well. I served it with buttered noodles and a small lightly dressed chopped vegetable salad. This was such a hit and the only thing I changed was I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh...thats what I had.

My family loves this recipe. I use tones rosemary garlic seasoning in place of all the seasoning. Sometimes I substitute chicken for the pork. I usually have to use more chicken broth because my family loves the sauce.

Excellent dish.  Pork is tender and juicy.  Sauce is delicious.  I doubled the recipe and added red wine and a little more garlic.  It's an easy dish to experiment with as far as adding flavor goes.  Easy;  a great week-night dish.  Thanks.

Pretty tasty, the recipe didn't yield too much food, just barely enough for 3 people, will increase quantities later.

Nothing special for us. Just okay. The recipe worse mechanically, just needs a deeper flavor. I'd make something else with my tenderloin. 
Btw, I made this recipe exactly as written.

This was a huge hit for my husband!  I served this over wheat egg noodles.  The pork was tender and sauce was just right.  It brought back some old hunting memories with his grandpa.  Unfortunely & surprisingly my 6 & 8 yr old girls did not care for it.  I added extra mushrooms and broth and shaved fresh parm over top.

Excellant!  Fairly quick and very easy. Love recipes that I can leave alone in the pan til serving.  I used chops as that is what I had and they were tender, moist and absolutely delish!!
Might want to watch the salt content between the butter/margarine - chicken broth - and 1/4 tsp salt.  Found mine just a tad salty but I think that was my own fault.  Well, done Donald!

Yum! Followed the recipe except that I omitted the savory because I didn't have any. This was fantastic and will likely be moved into our family's rotation of monthly meals. Very good! Served with garlic mashed potatoes and carrots.

I did not have Savory BUT it was very delicious without. My kids ages 5 and 7 enjoyed this as well. 
It went well with sides of mashed potato and oven roasted asparagus.

My boyfriend, who has always refused to eat pork loin LOVED this recipe, despite the picture posted with it.  Had to show him the other pics to get him to agree to try it.  Took the advise of others and doubles the sauce!  Definately a keeper :)

Wonderful! I dredged in flour before browning, doubled the broth and added just a bit of wine as others suggested. An easy/quick preparation when coming home from work.  Absolutely delicious.

My hubby & I aren't crazy about mushrooms, but I'm going to make this without.  From all the rave reviews, I can't imagine that 1/4 C of mushrooms could make much difference.

This is a great recipe. Try adding dried figs or other dried fruit (that you have re hydrated in warm water)to it the change up the flavor. Also, have added 1/2 cup of cream at the end for and even richer sauce.

Excellant!! Definitely a keeper. Next time I might try using half broth and half white wine. This might be good. 

This recipe by itself really needs no changes.

This is a good recipe. I made this with garlic mashed potatoes and brocolli. I followed recipe exactly and it was wonderful. I would add a tad more salt if you use a low sodium chicken broth like I did.

this was ok.  i even made my own chicken stock and my finished product, looked nothing like this picture.  i agree with another reviewer, and only cooked for 10 minutes - that was plenty.  if i make this again, i will slice the onions even thinner and saute them longer than 1 minute before adding the stock.

OK, this is GOOD!  I'm no Julia Child in the kitchen, so I look for simple and quick.  This fits the bill and is very tasty!  I added kitchen bouquet to brown up the gravy and served with red steamed potatoes.  This is now a favorite!

We LOVE it!  I made it pretty much as stated except for doubling the sauce, which I'm glad that I did.  I also didn't measure the garlic exactly and probably dumped in 1/2 - 1 Tablespoon.  It goes well over brown rice, and I'm sure it would be just as good over egg noodles.

This is a decent base recipe. I found it to be bland and the pork was very tough. Made it exactly as the recipe stated.... Recommend marinating the pork at least an hour prior to cooking and adding more garlic. Will try again with my own touches...

I made this for dinner tonight.   I would give it 10 stars if I could!  This has to be one of the easiest dishes I've prepared from this web-site, and I can definitely recommend this.  Absolutely delicious. I did however, double the recipe for the gravy.. Will definitely make this again.  My husband was very impressed.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This was excellent.  My husband called it resturant quality.  I doubled the gravy portion of the the recipe as called for in prior reviews.  I also used poultry seasoning as I couldn't find savory.  I marinated the meat in a mixture worchester sauce, shiraz, poultry seasoning, & a herb mixture my uncle makes.  It was so moist and yummy.

Bland. Of course the tenderloin was tender (it had better be) but the flavor was more like a hospital tray meat. And I did use savory and rosemary. Went strictly by the recipe since the reviews looked so good. Sorry but it did not do a thing for me.

A big winner!  I followed the recipe exactly but omitted the savory because we didn't have any.  This was so simple and very easy to make.  I thought it was full of flavor.  My husband was very happy with it too.  I plan to make this next time we have company.  Perfect w/ mashed potatoes and green beans just like the picture.

Though this isn't knock-me-out fabulous, it gets extra points for ease and ease of alteration dur to circumstance.  Didn't have savory, but used a fabulous herb blend that I had with rosemary and other herbs ... cut back on salt for family medical reason (and think it needed it).  The thing I loved is that I could finish it in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes - meaning that I can make this up and serve it for guests and not be slaving over the stove when they walk in.  I would just bump up the herbs a bit.

This was an ok recipe.  Separately the pork was wonderful as well as the sauce.  However, together the combination did not marry.  As another reviewer suggested...make this sauce with chicken.

I also doubled the sauce and increased broth to 1.5 c. Instead of savory and rosemary, I used 3/4 t poultry seasoning. After sautee onions, garlic and mush, I added 1/4 c wt wine and cooked for 1-2 min to evaporate the alcohol, then added flour, etc. I also returned pork to pan, covered and simmered for 30 minutes, juicy and tender

Very good recipe.  I would recommend doubling the sauce ingredients - I don't have a skillet that has a lid, so my sauce evaporated before the pork was cooked thoroughly, so my medallions were a bit dry.  I could tell, though, that had I a large enough lid, this would have been very tasty, indeed.

This was delicious.  I did not have a pork tenderloin handy so I just used boneless pork chops.  I have 4 children so I even cut these boneless chops into long strips before placing them in the skillet to simmer.  My family loved this dish.

the flavor is fantastic.  and easy!  (I had ~2x mushrooms, but that seemed fine).   The pork was a bit overdone, but I think that's because I browned it too long.  I'll definitely make this again.

I was really hoping for something spectacular when reading the reviews, but my husband and I agree that this recipe was "okay".  I followed it to the tee.  Although it was slightly better than some we have tried, it was quite bland.  The meat did cook up nice and tender though!

OK, I must admit I didn't quite follow the recipe as written, but by family HATE mushrooms and I didn't have any, so left them out, which does seem a somewhat big change, but I'll do it anyway.  Without the fungus - all my guys loved these!  Even my picky 15yo!  Served them with mashed potatoes and cheese broccoli.  Big hit!  Definitely will do this again.

This was great.  I really enjoyed it. Only made 2 minor changes....used fresh rosemary and deglazed the pan with Marsala sauce which, I think, added to the richness of the sauce.  I can't wait to try this with veal breast.

Super easy, and really tasty! The only thing I might change is to blend the veggies after they're sauteed, to have a smooth gravy. Oh, and I'll also keep my fingers out of the path of the knife blade. ;-) Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I thought this was 5 stars, wife thought it was 4.  Either way it was delicious and we'll repeat this one.  I did deglaze the pan with about an ounce of sherry.  Other than that, followed to the letter.

This was a great recipe.  My whole family really enjoyed the dish.  I did not have savory and could not find my rosemary.  So, I added Italian seasoning instead.  The pork was still great.  Thank you!!

I found this recipe for a quick and easy dinner. It turned out really good!! The kids really liked it. I will definitely make this again. My only tip is I added more than the 1/2 cup of chicken broth, and it made it a little more saucy.. Yummy! Served it with greenbeans and red potatoes. Delicious!!

Made this for dinner tonight, and it was yummy.  Couple of minor changes, because I used what I had on hand.  When you live 17 miles from the closest grocery store, you don't go to the store for savory, so I used thyme instead.  Instead of opening a can of chicken broth, I used chicken broth granules dissolved in water.  Also used a can of portabello mushrooms instead of fresh.  Gotta tell you it was really good, and the Knight gobbled it up like he had dragons to slay tonight.   I served this with homegrown green beans, cabbage, homemade whole wheat rolls, and lots of sweet tea to wash it down.  Very tasty indeed.

Great recipe!  I used cornstarch instead of flour to make it gluten free.  I doubled the mushrooms and broth and added a splash of white wine.  At the end I added a splash of gravy master to darken the gravy.  I've never had savory and I think that is what made it so good!!  I served it over rice and my husband I loved it!  Definitely a keeper!

The gravy in this dish is delicious! I used Bell's seasoning instead of the rosemary/savory . The pork was a little tough but I think it was my choice of using a pork chop cut into medallions. Definitely a great recipe. Double the gravy for yummy mashed!

I so wanted this to be good, especially after reading so many favorable reviews. BUT, many of the reviews were true. Good base recipe but it is a bland gravy. Maybe your sweet wife does like you in the kitchen so she can relax. Great effort but will need to keep experimenting to get that taste right. Thanks for doing most of the homework though!

REALLY wanted to like this, but just didn't.  Not sure why it didn't turn out like I imagined.  My teenage son loved it, husband said not bad.  I might one day try it again for a second chance since the reveiws were so high.  Followed exactly so maybe I goofed up somewhere.

This was good, but bland.  Needed more seasoning.  I couldn't find savory at the store, so maybe that is the key ingredient??  I will make again, but will maybe add some garlic salt for more flavor.  Definitely needed more salt.  I used a whole can of chicken broth and adjusted everything else accordingly to make more gravy.  Would be good on rice or potatoes.

This was wonderful – like others I doubled the sauce ingredients and still add more chick broth.  Hubby loved it!

husband liked it more than I did. Served it over buttered noodles with steamed carrots on the side. Made twice as much sauce since the tenderloin was gigantic! Needed more salt. Also used Italian seasoning since that was what we had. Husband wants it again, so may tweak it with a little more seasoning.

I have been cooking pork for a long time and could never get the "pork gravy" right! This is one of the best pork and gravy recipes' I have ever made! Thank you for sharing, your wife is right!  I added in addition, a little bit of white wine while pork was simmering. Let cook for 30 to 40 mins. and the meat was so tender! My kids ate it all, so I didn't have leftovers! Will definitely keep and make on our rotating dinner menu! Excellent and Delicious! Served it with steamed asparagus on side. Yummy!

I loved this recipe. Had to cook it myself after I read a review that Pork Tenderloins were tough.  How can that be.  They were tender just as I expected.  Maybe the reviewer used the wrong type of meat.

This was fantastic!  I made it for friends last night and they all raved about it.  I took others advice and doubled the sauce, which worked out perfectly.  I also did not have savory or rosemary, so I used parsley, italian spice and extra garlic.  It was very flavourful and quite easy to make.  I will definitely be making this meal again!

These were good, but I would have liked it a little more tender.  I also thought the "sauce" could've had a bit more flavor to it.  This will be a good recipe to play around with.

LOVED IT! Double the sauce. I used lots more mushrooms, 2 cloves of garlic and a large (rather than a small) onion to suit our tastes. I added thyme because I didn't have savory. I used chicken stock granules dissolved in water rather than broth - cut back on salt if the broth or stock you use is salty. Served with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans. AWESOME!

I made this for dinner last night and it was a hit! It had the same flavour of a nice roast pork, only faster! i will be making this again (and if you mix up a bit more sauce it goes great on top of mashed potatoes!)

This is a great recipe and the sauce turned out very tasty.  However, I felt that cooking the meat for 15 minutes was a bit too long because it turned out a bit dry.  I will make this again but I recommend that you cook it for less time (10 minutes) and then check to see if it needs to be cooked a bit longer.  I will make again but this time I would like to try it with chicken as others suggested. Thanks for sharing.

Try this recipe with chicken instead of pork. The sauce tastes more like it should go with chicken anyway.

I was looking for a base recipe to use up some pork shoulder (country ribs) and came across this one.  Made some major changes; added julienned red bell peppers with the other vegetables, used an entire can of chicken broth, and substituted thyme and parsley flakes for the seasonings (marjoram would have worked as well, but I didn't have any).  Also threw in a bay leaf when simmering.  Doubled the cooking time, and served over pasta.  The result?  Pretty darn good.  The sauce could have been a little thicker - next time I'll increase the flour, or maybe use 1/2 cup of half and half as one reviewer suggested.  Overall, a good recipe, and I've found a new way to cook a simple, satisfying pork dish!

Yum. Suprised at how tender the pork was. I buy the pork already in medallions from Lidl, so I skipped that step. Was tempted to add some creme fraiche towards the end, but resisted so I could try the recipe as is first. I'm glad I did, although I may add it next time. I didn't have the seasoning listed in the recipe, so used plenty of black pepper instead and relied on the seasoning in my homemade chicken stock, which I used instead of broth. Flavour was great. I'm sure rice is the natural accompaniment, but I really wanted roasted potatoes, so I served those with it instead. Again, yum. Very much enjoyed it, as did my boyfriend who shared the meal.

My roommate and I really liked this recipe. We could only find pre-marinated (garlic and herb) pork tenderloin that fit our quantity need (for 2 people) so I'm not sure how that played into the outcome. I added more broth but not enough flour to make more gravy. I would definitely add a little more than 1/2 c of chicken broth and about 3 tsp. of flour. Oh, and more mushrooms because I love them! Other than that, great - thanks!

Delish! I made double the sauce, and added about half a cup (or was it a cup...) of white wine to the sauce. Very tender and tasty. I was worried about the scent of the rosemary being so strong during cooking, but I went out and bought savory specifically for this recipe, and it toned down the rosemary just right. Served on rice it was filling and healthy. I will definitely make this creamy dish again!

This was good but not great. The pork did not have much flavor but it was very tender.  I will make it again though since both kids ate it.

Excellent recipe for pork tenderloin.  The only change we would make would be to increase the mushrooms to 1 cup.  We served over egg noodles.  Although, white wine would rock in the sauce.

This was very good and may have been even better with a tenderloin, but I had boneless portk chops so I used them.  They were a little tough, but that is the meat not the recipe.  I didn't have savory or rosemary (took my bush out of the yard) but even without those the sauce was still tastey.  This was certainly easy and would work on a busy night.  Thanks for sharing.

This dish is awesome!  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the gravy part.  I also used kosher salt instead of regular. It came out very tasty and my husband  (who is very picky) said it tasted quite good.  My kids ate every bit!  This is a winner!

I didn't have the medallions so I use pork chops chopped into tips. Served over rice and it was excellent.

This was great.  I used veggie broth and didn't use savory but it was fantastic.  My pork was slightly overdone.  Next time I'm going to chop a little off the time.

This was so good!  I took a previous reviewer's recommendation of doubling the sauce portion and think it could even be tripled, it didn't go very far.  Was very tasty, though.  I didn't have fresh mushrooms so just used a can of no-salt mushrooms, drained.  Also, I think I will cut the medallions closer to 1" thick because I had so many.
