This recipe has been a favorite of my family for a long time.  We use the same ingrediants, minus the cheese but put it together differently.  

I use frozen peas, not canned which you can pre-cook for 5 minutes before use or just toss in frozen.  I mix the mushroom soup, tuna and 3/4 of the crushed chips together and put in the casserole dish.  I use the remaining 1/4 bag of chips on the top, and bake, covered for 20 minutes until heated.  

Just like how my sisters and I would fight, my kids fight over this dinner and always want seconds.

I used most of the ingredients given..the tuna, soup, potato chips,cheese..but added a few of my own as well...wide egg noodles, frozen veggie blend, mozzerella cheese. I also sprinkled real bacon bits on top of each serving. Delish!!

My husband was longing for a recipe similar to this that his mother used to make.  This had a few additions that I think made it even better.  When I made it I added 1/2 soup can of milk and blended it with the soup. To this I added a 4 oz. can of drained, sliced mushrooms. It did need a bit more zip, so next time I think I will add some paprika to the soup mixture.

I use corn or mixed veggies instead of peas. Sometimes I stir in a cup or so of cooked egg noodles or elbow macaroni before baking. Also good with about 1/4 c. chopped bacon added. Additionally, tastes very good with crushed tortilla chips instead of potato chips.

You don't have to layer the ingredients, either... tastes just as good if you put everything together and gently mix it before pouring into the casserole dish.

Also, mix in 2 or 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise to make it creamier if you like.

This is a good basic recipe for tuna casserole that you can easily improvise on, depending on what's in the cupboard.

NOTE: If you think this recipe is too salty, use salt-free chips which are easy to find in any grocery store.

I make mine in a 9x13 pan.  Instead of cream of mushroom, I use cream of chicken.  I  have peas as a side and not in the casserole.  I like the hot casserole with cold cottage cheese too. :)

This is good but I think it would be better with shredded cheese on top.

This recipe was okay.  It was very easy to make but tasted a little dull.  I will keep looking for another tuna casserole as a "keeper".

This is great for a simple, easy meal. I usually add sliced hard-cooked eggs, and don't worry about the cheese if I don't have any. Lots of pepper, too!

Way too salty for our tastes.  Fast, yes.  Edible, yes.  Definitely not a keeper.

Like PUCKIE25 I mixed the soup and frozen peas together.  But, instead of Potato Chips I substituted panko which reduced the fat considerably.  Also, instead of cheddar, I lightly covered the layers with Pecorino-Romano, which added a little saltiness but still gave the casserole a nice cheesy flavor.  Good recipe, I'll make it again.

My preference in this recipe is to omit the cheese and use wide egg noodles to fill out the casserole.

This was simple, easy comfort food. I used bbq potato chips and Velveeta cubes along with frozen peas and it turned out well.

Thank you, thank you!  I also remember this as a child and thought there were more ingredients!
It's a great "comfort" dish and soooo easy.

It was ok, but i wasn't really crazy about the crushed potato chips in here for some reason.  Maybe i have too many other recipes fairly similar to this one (minus those chips). It was easy, though, and good in a pinch i guess.

this is a good recipe, but the cheese should go under the chips on the top layer. otherwise, it burns.

A bit dry & bland - I had high hopes for this recipe b/c my grandmother used to make a potato chip casserole that I loved as a kid.  Unfortunately, this wasn't as good as I had hoped/remembered. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the people that like this most are kids!  :)  Thanks for the post.

I didn't use potato chips
I used Italian Bread Crumbs
Onion
Fresh Garlic
Celery
Shredded Cheese
A smidge of Johnny's Seasoning
