I made this for Father's day and it was SO delicious. It's 4 stars because the instructions were not clear and that made me feel very insecure while making the pie. If anyone else is lost and is using a top pie crust as well, this is what I did: 1. I laid a 9inch pre-made Pillsbury pie crust in a glass pie pan, baked it at 350 degrees for 10 minutes BEFORE EVERYTHING. 2. Pulled it out of the oven and poured a box of blueberries in the semi-baked shell. 3. Combined the rest of the ingredients in a sauce pan, including the remaining 2pints of blueberries. 3. Cooked it for lower heat until the sauce pan was high in blueberry sauce. You can add cinnamon or vanilla if you want. 4. Poured it on top of the uncooked blueberries in the pie, added a top criss-cross pie layer and baked it at 450 for about 11-13 minutes.

This is an easy, and by far the best, blueberry pie I've ever made.  The second time I tried it I made some changes: added 1/4t each vanilla and almond extract, and 1/8t cinnamon (will up it to 1/4t next time to try that).  I changed the ratio of berries to 1 1/2C fresh and 2 1/2C cooked.  I found 1/3C sugar worked well when serving the pie with ice cream.  I look forward to making this pie because it's such a treat.  Thanks, Nancy.

Is the flour, butter, lemom juice and sugar suppose to be cooked on the stove with the blueberries?  The recipe was not specific.

I made this pie last night and it was excellent! I'm not a baker at all but this turned out wonderful using ready-made pie crusts. I bought 2 bottom crusts and used one as the top crust. I modified the recipe by adding in some strawberries and cinnamon. I baked the bottom crust for about 10 minutes and set aside to cool. I cooked the pie filling using 2 cups of frozen blueberries (thawed, rinsed and drained) and 1 cup of fresh, sliced strawberries. I followed recipe exactly except for adding in 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I put the fresh blueberries into the bottom crust then poured the cooked filling on top, put on the top crust and baked for another 15 minutes until browned. I served it with whipped cream. It was delicious! My daughter, who claimed she didn't like pie, gobbled up a whole piece! I chose this recipe because it didn't use cornstarch. The filling tasted very fresh and the fresh blueberries were still firm and just popped in your mouth. Next time I think I'll reduce the sugar just a bit and I might even try my hand at making my own pie crust. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This recipe is SUPER easy and SUPER delish!  I baked it for some friends and they gobbled it right up.  We picked blueberries, so they were very fresh and large, and the pie was just the right amount of sweet and tart.  The lemon juice isn't overpowering, and the fact that a layer of blueberries isn't cooked means you'll have a pie that won't completely fall apart or get runny.  This is my new blueberry pie recipe - why mess with perfection?

The taste was wonderful, however, when cooking the blueberries, the flour, butter and lemon juice mixture was so thick and did not loosen even when the blueberries started to pop.  I added more butter and lemon juice and it helped. Next time I will not use as much flour.  But, I will definately make it again.

This was the first time I've ever made blueberry pie. The only blueberry pie I've eaten is store-brought, and this was better. I never liked the overly-sweet, pudding-consistency texture of pies, and this was not too sweet, nor too gooey. I loved actually tasting the blueberry. Ate it with vanilla ice cream, and it was too delicious for words. I scarfed it down, and so did my brother, who usually calls my baking . He didn't even try to disguise his pleasure this time, asking me to bake another one. I followed suggestions and used a teaspoon of cinnamon, plus half-teaspoons of vanilla and almond extract. Now, I was slightly puzzled on how to put a top-pie-crust on it. The recipe doesn't describe baking. So after I finished all the instructions, I baked the pie for ten minutes at 450 degrees F - with a top lattice-strip crust. It didn't affect the rest of the pie too much. Still wonderful!

Very flavorful pie. I added 1/4 tsp vanilla, almond extract and cinnamon. I also used more berries.  Even though I forgot to add flour, it still turned out delicious! (I won't make that mistake again). It was a little running, but not a disaster. Just a note: it's important to taste the berries before you begin, so you can adjust the sugar accordingly. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

The best blueberry pie I've made. It has that fresh blueberry taste because it isn't baked. Great for dessert after a bbq. Be sure to refrigerate before serving though orelse it will fall apart. Great recipe!

This is a nice recipe, but I had to add a lot more blueberries to fill the pie shell because I was using a 9" pie shell.  But it seems like the filling as is would still be a little low for an 8" shell if you like a really full pie.  After reading the reviews I decided to add a little cinnamon, but I think I'd like it more as it's written.  Just remember to add more berries if you're using a bigger pie plate.

This is the best blueberry pie I have ever tasted. After reading other reviews I have the following tips: There is no top crust in this recipe and you won't miss it.  Save it for quiche or make two pies.  Also, yes you do cook the second pint of blueberries with the flour mixture.  If you stick to the recipe you will not be disappointed!

Followed the recipe to a T, one of the best fruit pies out there! Love, love, love it!!! So easy to make, too!!! Baked the pie shell first (did not prick it and filled it w/dry beans) then filled it later.  Did not use a top crust, put whipped topping on and it was magnifique!  Update: instead of filling the shell with beans, I have found a way to bake the shell w/o wasting any beans. Line unpricked pastry shell with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Bake at 450 degrees F for 8 minutes. Remove foil; bake 5 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out so yummy with the fresh blueberries!  I am just confused as to how to put the lattice on top since the pie did not finish in the oven.

This "Fresh Blueberry Pie II" was suberb! A very easy recipe to follow, and the pie turned out great. I did take some hints from other reviewers: Added 1/4 tea.of vanilla & almond extracts along with the same amt. of cinnamon-bumped up the lemon juice to double. The sugar, butter & flour stayed the same. I took the pie to a BBQ and these are some comments that were made. Wow..Fantastic..You made this?!.. Can I get the recipe?..Thanks to Nancy Fields for her great recipe!!

I'll admit that the directions on this recipe do not follow your classic pie recipe, so I was a bit unsure.  But I was happily surprise at how simple and flavorful it was.  It's a keeper. thanks!

I love this recipe.  It is not too sweet but bursts with blueberry flavor. I like the fact that there is no cornstarch, just natural pectin from the fruit.  The last time I made it, I grated alittle lemon rind in with the cooked blueberries and it gave it a slight more lemon flavor-a perfect complement to the blueberries. I did not put the criss-cross pastry on top to save calories- it cut just fine.  Make it- you won't be sorry.

This is a really good blueberry pie.  It was super easy to make too.  I did add a top crust, and because I had to throw it in the oven with the blueberries to bake the top crust, I think it detracts a little bit from the consistency of the fresh/not cooked berries, because they get cooked a little bit in the oven. But it was still delicious, and I think that adding the top crust makes it better, so I would do it the same next time.

THis is a great receipe. The only thing I changed was to cook all the berries and not put some fresh ones in the pie. I tried it once and didn't like it that way.

This was okay. It needed more cornstarch or flour as it was very watery. I wouldn't make this again, but it was easy.

I am so PLEASE to say that would give the  YOU the five stars. It was so tasty and delicious blueberries pie. We can taste each ingredients it does gives the  flavors. From now on, I will cook my blueberries first half and then pour over the fresh blueberries pie crust.

Someone did mention it about the soupy blueberries sauce . Try to mix and add the corn starch it will give you thicker sauce along with 1/2 a cup of flour mix with all the ingredients as above.  

THANKS for sharing your recipe the Fresh Blueberry Pie II. luci

ps. I did use  the cinnamon, n the vanilla instead the lemon juice. WOW!It's D E L I C I O U S! YUMMY, YUMMY!

I'm throwing out all my other blueberry pie recipes. This one is the best I've tried. I was not sure how long to cook the blueberries; till they all popped or half of them? That wasn't clear to me, but the pie was delicious and I will be making it again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

4 stars!  The reviewer who mentioned adding a lattice crust and baking again- thank you!  This recipe works beautifully with Rhubarb, Peaches, Apples- with really firm or sour fruit (like the Rhubarb), I cook all of the filling at once instead of 1/2 cooked, 1/2 fresh, but with sweeter/softer berries, leaving 1/2 fresh really amps up the flavor.  Also- nice that this starts out with less sugar.  Taste your fruit and filling- can always add more if needed.

I used the filling from this recipe and found that taking the all-purpose flour and changing it up, I used half all purpose and half cornstarch diluted help to get the berries thicker. I also used a mixed berries filling; raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 tsp of vanilla  instead of just white sugar. I made my own shell, for he first time. It was wonderful!! Definitely made my sunday!!  Thank you!

This didn't make blueberry pie, this made blueberry soup! I have no idea what went wrong, as I followed the directions and let the pie set for at least an hour. I won't be making this again. The 3 stars is because the soup tastes good.

I made this pie and it had no taste at all.  The cooked berries on top of the fresh berries, in my opinion, did not provide enough taste.  After all it's the sugar mixture that gives the berries it's  flavor.  I'm sorry but I don't agree with all the raves about this pie.  It is easy to make, I'll agree with that.

Quite tasty although it absolutely needs time to set up or you will have a soupy blueberry mess.  I tried it with .25 t of vanilla and almond extract.  Next time I would omit the almond extract but keep the vanilla.  I really enjoyed the combination of cooked and fresh berries.  Marvelous with vanilla ice cream.  Reducing the sugar will help the the naturally sweet flavour of the berries stand out.

This turned out great! My first pie and there wasn't a crumb left.  To make the latice top, I bought two frozen pie crusts. While one was baking, I let the other thaw and then sliced it into strips and laid them across the top.  Then, once the pie was finished, I stuck it in the oven for about 15 minutes at 400 to bake the top.  Served with french vanilla ice cream. Amazing.

I can't understand how the pie in the picture can be the pie in the recipe since the shell was baked beforehand and there was no baking after the fruit was poured into the pie shell???  My husband and I were disappointed with this.  The taste was fine but it was basically like a bunch of blueberries on a pie shell with a little sauce.  I had never made a fruit pie before but I have made fruit toppings for cheesecake and I think that it would've helped this recipe if half of the blueberries would've been cut in half instead of left whole.  I will keep looking for a blueberry pie recipe.

The taste is fantastic and very fresh. I tried this as a double crust pie, though, and it didn't work for me. It was full of liquid and I ended up pouring it over ice cream like a sauce. The taste is so yummy though that I plan to try it again but making it as the recipe describes.  I'm sure it will work better that way.

UPDATE:  I changed my rating to 5 stars. I followed the recipe exactly and it was outstanding!  Even my husband who dislikes blueberries loved this pie. I plan on making it all summer while the blueberries are plentiful and cheap.

I had two pints of blueberries to use up quickly, so I whipped this up.... Though it's five star in taste (adding vanilla, cinnamon and cutting the sugar to 1/3 cup), the filling amounts are WAAAAAY TOO LITTLE!  This barely filled my crust (a pre-baked Pillsbury one).  I was unhappy to say the least.  I will absolutely make this again, but DOUBLE  - if not TRIPLE - the filling!

I love blueberry pie so I tried this recipe. It is excellent. I did add 1/4 tsp. almond extract, 1/8 tsp Double Strength Vanilla, 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the flour, lemon juice and sugar. I only mixed this for a minute and then added the blueberries. I will add more blueberries next time. I cooked this for about 10 minutes constantly stirring with a whisk. You don't want it to burn. Cook the pie crust about 30 minutes before you are ready to make this mixture. I used fresh blueberries that I had in the freezer. They turned out great. Thanks so much for the recipe. I did not put another pie crust on top like the picture. It takes no time to make this. I could really impress by taking this somewhere.

I can bake almost anything but the art of pie baking eludes me until this one. My husband, who is my biggest critic, LOVED this pie. So easy and comes out great. I used fresh for the bottom layer and frozen for the cooked layer and it was wonderful. This is definitely a keeper.

3 stars seems too low, so I'm giving it a 4. The pie filling was good - I can use for other things as well. I will use a homemade crust next time.Can't beat the easy pie filling.

About as easy as can be. I used frozen mini Maine blueberries and made 2 in about 20 minutes. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to this to make the blueberries even better. Thanks. This is a keeper.

The price of blueberries always drops around my birthday, so I make this pie every year for myself. The only thing I tweak on this recipe is I add about twice the amount of lemon juice because I like the fruit to be tart. Other than that, this is fresh, easy, and delicious.

I used fresh frozen blueberries and fresh canned boysenberries in this recipe. It was AMAZING! I also used some cornstarch instead of just flour because the boysenberries had more juice than fresh would have. I added a little cinnamon and vanilla to taste. Great recipe! Thanks!!

An excellent blueberry pie, my family loved it.  I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, only change was using a little more berries in the cooking part.  Used a pie crust from this site too and it was great.  Never Fail Pie Crust II, it was also excellent.  I will use this recipe again and again, thanks.

This was a fantastic pie, especially given how simple it is to make.  I appreciate that it has few and basic ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly.    We had guests over for dinner, and the four of us finished off the entire pie.  I will make it again tomorrow!

I took this to a dinner party last night, and everyone loved it.  They said it was a whole different experience from a baked blueberry pie.  I did like someone in the photos... made pastry cutouts for the top and baked them while the crust was baking.  I used the 1/4 tsp of vanilla, almond, cinnamon others suggested.  Next time I'll omit the cinnamon.  (Completely a person taste with that)  I think that without the cinnamon it will taste even more like a 'fresh berry' pie.  I used the 1/2 c sugar thinking it would not be too much, but next time I'll cut that back a bit.  Served with vanilla ice cream this was fantastic.  I will definitely make it again.

This was awful!  It was very tart.  My blueberries were very good, I ate some as I washed them.  There wasn't enough filling for a 8 in pie.  The directions were unclear.  The picture shows a pie with a top.  Some reviewers gave directions for a top.  It was a disaster and I had company over for dessert.  Luckily I made some cookies too.

YUMMY! I followed other reviewers' suggestions at adding some cinnamon, and it was absolutely delicious!  My husband is not a big fruit pie fan (except for apple), and he tasted this and said "WOW! That is GOOD!"  He even commented later that evening AGAIN how good this pie was.  I've only made a few pies in my time (mostly pumpkin), and this one was easy to make, and tastes great!

Everyone loved it!!!  I used 3 pints of blueberries for a regular 9" pie, splitting 1 1/2 pints raw and adjusting the cooking ingredients for 1 1/2 cooked.

This was fantastic. I have used a Fanny Farmer recipe for years that used cornstarch, and sometimes it didn't always set-up. This was better, fresher and yummy! I was worried because there wasn't much liquid to "bring to a boil", but it worked.

Never having made blueberry pie before, I wanted an easy recipe with good ratings.  This pie fit the bill and is super delicious.  I have had blueberries in my freezer since picking them fresh in August.  Just run your frozen blueberries under lukewarm water to thaw.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar with fantastic results. I also did a lattice top for the pie, brushing first with butter and baking at 450ºF for 12 minutes to get a nice golden brown color. This pie is now my favorite!

I found a sale on fresh blueberries..3.99 for 2 whole pounds?!? I got 6lbs total. Not wanting to waste the whole idea of fresh blueberries and taint the health factor too...I came across this recipe which allowed me to enjoy my fresh blueberries along with this SUPER easy and tasty recipe! I was impressed. I usually tweak every recipe I use, but I didn't do anything to this one and it was great. I did have really sweet blueberries so next time I might increase lemon and/or reduce sugar. SO YUMMY!

It was a good recipe. I used wild blueberries which have quite a lot more juice that the domestic ones. I needed to add some cornstarch to thicken it properly. I also made up the filling and cooled it then put it into mini fillo shells with a whipped cream topping. It makes the filling go father and is nice for when you only have a small amount of wild berries and a lot of people who want a taste. Those wild blueberries are a lot of work to pick!

This was just the recipe I was looking for!  It was so delicious and easy!  My husband thought it was the best pie I ever made!  I was especially happy that I didn't have to bake it in the oven and clean up boiled-over juice afterwards.  Thanks so much, Nancy!

I followed the recipe, using a store bought premade crust. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla based on one reviewer's suggestion. I also used an "apple crisp" topping instead of a top crust, since I had some topping frozen in the freezer. This pie got great reviews.

This is the only blueberry pie recipe I will use. I love the fact that it uses both cooked and uncooked blueberries in a aked crust.  Once I have the blueberries prepared I put them in the prebaked shell and top them with streuse.   Then I put it back in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the streusel is golden brown.

I did not try yet but why is it that people don't read the directions correctly. The directions tell you to boil the flour, butter, lemon juice and sugar before you to pour it in the shell.  This is also a no bake pie and I see that people put it into the oven.  If you want a baked recipe, then find one that you do bake.  I love fresh pies and this looks good!

I've made this pie several times now.  It is always requested, and people go crazy over it.  It is easy as "pie".  No really, super simple.  BUT, the taste is fresh and fantastic.  The texture is amazing.  Nothing like the overly gelled goo pies you sometimes end up with when baking with fresh fruit.

Delicious.  And so easy!  I used a graham cracker crust pie shell so no baking needed!  I made my own healthy topping.  Just mix a cup of greek yogurt, a dash of cinnamon, a dash of vanilla extract and agave nectar to taste.  Keep chilled until ready to serve.  Thanks for this recipe!

I did not care for this recipe. The filling never set. WHen I cut inot the pie I instanly knew it was a mistake. THe fillling was liquid. When I removed the first piece, the filling immediately ran out of the rest of the pie and filled the missing spot. It should have cornstarch or something else to make it gel some. I've been cooking and baking for 30 + years.

Love this recipe.  Very easy.  I like just the bottom crust.  And I love that it doesn't get cooked.  (only the crust before the filling goes in.)  Slices perfectly after cooled. I't's a keeper in our house.

This was very good.  I did tweak the recipe a little.  I only had frozen blueberries so I added it all to the saucepan.  I used about 1/4 c sugar total.  I put cinnamon and sugar on the bottom crust.  Yum!!

This pie received RAVE reviews from even my most finicky eaters!  The whole blueberries were a wonderful little surprise every time you took a bite and the sauce received much praise.  Using a combination of fresh and cooked blueberries was a wonderful idea!  The instructions were super easy to follow but since I made my own crust, I followed the cooking instructions of another reviewer and had NO troubles whatsoever!  I have never made a pie before this one and have now been elected as the holiday pie-maker so long as I continue to bring this one to our family functions!  Thanks so much!

I gave this 5 stars because the taste was perfect!  I think it is lacking a thickening agent.  And the directions are unclear.  I used 1.5 cups of fresh blueberries and 1.5 cups of frozen and it turned out great.  I also used a pie crust recipe from this site ("Grandma's Pie Crust") and it just turned out great.  Since I made my own crust and included a top crust, I cooked the whole thing for 25 minutes at 350 and served it warm.  With a scoop of vanilla ice cream, this is one of the best pies I have ever had.

So so so yummy and really easy! The only change I made was to add a bit of lemon zest when cooking the berries. Next time I am going to try it with an oat crumble topping.

Great, super easy recipe. I've made it three times so far. I enjoyed it more with half raspberries and half blueberries. It gave the pie filling more substance rather than the blueberries, which tended to stay whole.

This recipe made me learn to like blueberries.  I do adjust the sugar according to the sweetness of the blueberries.

This pie is great and really easy!  My 4-year-old had been requesting blueberry pie for weeks (even though he'd never had it before and I never make pie).  I used my grandmother's secret pie crust recipe - Pillsbury Pie Crusts, which is great for someone like me who usually only bakes at Christmas.  I did add vanilla like some other reviewers suggested and I let my son help put a weaved top crust on it and baked if for another 12 minutes.  In his words it was "delicious, yummy, and sweet!"

What a superb idea to use both fresh and cooked blueberries; with one you get the sweet syrupy goodness and the other provides the pop of freshness. Highly recommended with a dollab of whipped cream.

This is so easy to make and very delicious!  I doubled the recipe to make two pies and I'm so glad I did!  The first one was gone quickly.  We're all looking forward to having the other one for dessert tonight!  Thanks for this recipe!

This really was the best blueberry pie I've made.  Putting the fresh berries in first made it amazing.  You got the "pop" of a fresh berry in every bite.  It held together well.

We loved this pie!  The mix of fresh and cooked berries gives you the best of both worlds.  I took the tip from some other reviews and added a little cinnamon and vanilla.  I also adjusted the sugar based on the ripeness of the berries.  Next time, I am going to add the top crust to help hold the berry filling together. It set up nicely, but it crumbles easily.

I made this pie for company and everyone ate it without complaint, but there were no rave reviews and no one was interested in seconds.

While it tasted good, I have had better blueberry pie. I don't think I will make it again. It was too sweet for my taste, even though I cut back on the sugar.

Absolutely one of the best blueberry pies I've tasted.  Putting hot, syrupy cooked berries over fresh creates a very fresh, flavorful pie that's not too sweet and absolutely decadent with a dollop of fresh whipped cream.  I recently tried replacing the 2 pints of fresh berries with 2 pints of fresh cherries, pitted and halved.  Superb!
