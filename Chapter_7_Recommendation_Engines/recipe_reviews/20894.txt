Just loved this this recipe.  Of course I fine tuned for my tastes but it was better than any I've had in any restaurant.  I used 2 leftover roasted breasts, 1 1/2 cups salsa, less cinnamon,
and I did not use the blender to pulverize the salsa. I merely added all the ingredients to the pan after onion and garlic were tender and heated.  I used 10 10inch flour tortillas and filled them each with 1/3 cup filling.  Now get this!  I baked 5 of them and deep fried the other 5.  The fried ones were more authentic and did not absorb as much oil as I thought they would.( oil must be very hot) The baked ones were just as delicious but with a slightly different texture to the tortillas.  Be sure to paint the tortillas with oil all over before baking.  Excellent recipe, Jeri. Kudos to you   Francy

Almost 3 years after first trying this recipe, I still make it at least twice a month. I've eliminated the beans (makes the chimis too mushy) and the garlic (makes the leftovers too stinky). I make extras and freeze them to reheat for lunches -- obviously they're not crispy when reheated, but they're still delicious and the aroma will drive your co-workers crazy with envy! I don't even have to measure any of the ingredients, it's become so familiar and automatic. Thank you, Jeri!

Great recipe!  I added a little non-fat cheddar.  Hubby loves Chimichangas...so now we can have them and still eat a little more healthy!

The hint of cinnamon gives this recipe an interesting twist. It's just enough to be subtle.  The chili powder makes a very strong statement so cut back on that a bit if you prefer a little less heat and intensity of chili flavor. Don't bother with adding the water and the extra step of pureeing the sauce as it's not necessary and will just create more clean up. There is also no need to secure the rolls with toothpicks nor turn them while baking. Just roll and bake - they turn out crispy all over and won't fall apart.

Super yummy!  This was such a great recipe to make with a leftover roasted chicken.  I'm a bit lazy in the kitchen so I substituted a taco seasoning packet in place of all the spices and it was fabulous.  I also took a tip from another reviewer and warmed the tortillas in the microwave before wrapping which made things even easier.  This recipe is a keeper!

I loved this recipe! The only things we changed was we only used 1/8 cup of chili powder and added a little more than 1/2 tsp of cumin. We did not flip the chimi's at the end but took them out after 6 minutes to put cheese on top to melt. My husband did not like the cinnamon, but I loved it. Everyone in the family raved about this recipe and I will be making it again. 

If you need to get shredded chicken, put bone-in chicken in a crockpot on high for 4 hours with a can of chicken broth and enough water to cover the chicken. After 4 hours the chicken will fall off the bone and you can easily shred it!

I took the advice of many reviewers and reduced the amount of chili powder and completely omitted the cinnamon.  The only problem I had was that the "shell" didn't brown in the time given.  I baked at 425 for 25 minutes and it still wasn't as crispy as we would have liked.  I think I will make again...much healthier than deep frying, but will tinker with spices (like the others) and add our other favorite ingredients like shredded cheese.  Thanks for the post.

I have been making this for years, easy & excellent.  I add one can of drained corn & sometimes 1-2 chopped cooked potatos. I saute the garlic & onion in the pan & then throw it in a big bowl with the rest of the ingrdents(less clean up) We like the sauce thick so I never add the water or blend it.  Also use refried black beans they taste the best.

These were very good. Instead of putting in the separate spices, I used a taco seasoning packet that I had in the pantry. I bought a rotisserie chicken from Publix and shredded it, which worked really well, and I only used a half of the recommended cinnamon because I was nervous about it. It gave a slightly different flavor which was great. I also topped with store bought queso, on each serving. I wouldn't recommend adding to the whole dish because it would make the leftovers mushy, just heat up the queso and add when serving. Leftovers were great too. Thanks for a great recipe.

My kids really loved this recipe.  I made some changes following other reviewers' suggestions:  I used taco seasoning and a can of (mostly) drained diced tomatoes for the chicken mixture which made it just saucy enough.  I had some leftover cooked rice that I warmed up and used in the tortillas along with some warmed refried beans, and I added some shredded colby jack cheese.  I also used uncooked tortillas that I bought at Costco and lightly cooked them in a skillet before filling them.  And I sprayed with cooking spray which made them nice and crispy.  Very good recipe!

These chimis were much healthier than you would get at a restaurant.  I was hesitant to add the cinnamon, but I finally did and loved the result.  I also used a store bought packet of taco seasoning instead of chile powder and cumin.

These were excellent!  I used fresh salsa and omitted the water, halved the chili powder and cinnamon, added extra garlic, used fat-free tortillas and fat-free sour cream for a very low-fat and delicious dinner!  Got raves from the boyfriend who was in disbelief that low-fat Mexican food could taste this good.  A+

Great recipe for leftover chicken, and fairly easy to assemble.  Two suggestions:  first, the flour tortillas will crisp up on their own without adding oil.  Second, add the spices and stir one minute before adding the salsa (oil helps release the flavors in the spices).  Definitely will try this recipe again.  However, the sauce lacked a little something...maybe lime juice? Coriander?

This was a nice way to use up some roasted chicken instead of the usual soup. I made it exactly as directed except I didnt blend sauce til smooth and in my opinion its not a necessary step. I also made my own refried beans by draining a can of black beans (could use pinto beans instead) heat a little oil in a frying pan add some chopped garlic then the drained beans, 1 tsp cumin, a few drops tabasco, salt & pepper. Using a potato masher smoosh the beans, cook a few mins then set aside. Make sauce add chicken, assemble chimi's. Next time I will skip the cinnamon, just personal preference. A good recipe though, thanks for sharing!

I did take a fast track route and seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning and pan fried it...then shredded it. What I love about about this is how flavourful and filling this is and it is BAKED...not fried...so easy to make a healthy and flavourful dish. Thank you for that!

Chicken Chimi in the Oven Haiku: "Husband said of these: 'They're restaurant quality.' Well, said between bites." So I halved the recipe and ended up w/ 8, that I made in 8" tortillas; bit more difficult to fill and roll, since they were smaller, but wow, really fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly (used lime & cilanto-flavored refried beans though), and couldn't have been more impressed, although these suckers are SCORCHING right out of the oven. And I wasn't exaggerating - my hubs did in fact, say they tasted like something from a Mexican restaurant.

This is one of the rare recipes that I make over and over again. It's really that good. I have made it with the onion and garlic and sometimes I just rely on the onion and garlic that's in the salsa that I use. I always add the amount of spices called for too. I usually add a little shredded cheddar on top of the refried beans and have never found that I need to secure the tortillas with a toothpick. If we ever have leftovers they never go to waste!

This recipe was just ok. The flavors didn't really blend well together. Definately not worth the hassle of shredding chicken. Our leftovers remain uneaten. A much better (and simpler) recipe is Beef and Bean Chimichangas on this site. My husband would eat those for 5 days straight.

I had to tweak this recipe a bit, because of the salt and fat content.  I always have left over chicken so I heated the leftovers added sautéed onions, with some salsa.  I made the Taco seasoning I recipe,  on this site,  which has much less salt.  Mixed it all together.  Warmed up some flour tortillas & put the chicken mixture with refried black beans (my hubby's favorite)  Rolled and placed in a pan.  Brushed with a good grade of evoo.  When they were finished, topped with Fat Free Sour cream, Extra Salsa, & Sliced avocados.  Yum

Very good recipe and very simple for a weeknight. If you like to let your meat mixture sit a few hours before making your wraps then go for it but  I thought  it was good the way it was. We have chili powder that is not spicy,  so we had no issues with heat other then what was in the medium salsa.

We liked these a lot, with some slight modifications. I used only 1T chili powder and it was PLENTY. I also meant to add only a teeny bit of cinnamon but the shaker got away from me a little and added probably more than what's called for - but it's okay it didn't really taste cinnamon-y at all, so no need to be afraid of the 1/2 tsp. I didn't bother with the blender, but mashed up the salsa a bit with a potato masher - I don't even think that's necessary though unless you have REALLY thick salsa. I added a little shredded cheese too, but we didn't even really notice it, so I'd say it's not really necessary to add (or add quite a bit). I also only had 6-inch tortillas - I got 10 6-inch chimis with these filling measurements. The final product was very good - we ate just with some sour cream, but I'd like to try to find a sauce that will compliment them. My favourite restaurant chimi gets served with ranchero sauce.

This was delicious!! I used ground chicken and chicken taco seasoning mix in lieu of the other  spices, except the cinnamon which I highly recommend including, because it gives the meat a subtle, rich flavor that made this filling so unique and special! I didn't have enough salsa, so I substitued 1/4 c. with cocktail sauce and also added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese between the bean and meat layer. Serve with sour cream and it's a new family favorite!

While the flavors were too strong (way too much chili powder), the recipe seemed to be missing something that would make it great.  No something I would recommend or cook again.

I added some brown/white rice that I had leftover and also put half regular salsa and half Costco mango salsa, which gave it a sweetness. I have a daughter who is sensitive to spicy foods so I halved the chili powder and added some smoked paprika, which I add to almost all the tomato based sauces I make (except Italian) for a smokiness that really adds a lot. I know this sounds like a lot of add-ons but if you made this as is -- it's a great meal. Try Tortilla Factory tortillas. To me, they are the best tasting you can buy (at least in Seattle) in a supermarket.

Tried for the first time tonight, they were definitely a hit, my husband went back for 3rds!:)  I was also reluctant to use the cinnamon, but so glad I did!  It gives the tortilla the taste like the chimi had been fried.  Texture was great turning them every 5 minutes as directed, with each turn I brushed with a little more olive oil.  Served green chili over the top with all the fixins....DELISH! Thank you for the recipe!

My boyfriend and I love, love, love this recipe! I did a few things different. I boiled the chicken breast and shredded it by hand. I added all seasonings except cinnamon and also added a little red pepper. Added shredded cheese inside the chimi and once it was cooked, I topped the outside with the remaining salsa.

All I can say is YUMMO Jeri! I must admit, as with a lot of recipes I see, the addition of the cinnamon scared me a little. Most of us associate cinnamon with sweet and not savory dishes, but for once, I decided expand my epicurian horizon and go for it. I'm so glad I did because the spice didn't jump out at you, however, gave the sauce a wonderful background flavor. The kind of flavor that you can't quite put your finger on, but you know you like what you're eating. I also added a goodly amount of shredded cheddar to the chimi and my mexican food lovin' kids thought that these were amazing. Thanks Jeri, we loved 'em!

It's really important to use a good quality spices that you know you like the flavour of.  I've made this a few times and once used a different brand of chilli powder from my usual.  It radically changed the taste and had I used that brand first time around I never would have made it again!  Does taste better with shredded cheese inside and lots of sour cream and guacamole (but only after a hard work-out!)

Made this 2 nights ago to bland reviews from my family of 5. I subbed enchilada sauce and salsa combo for salsa/water/spices.  I also added cheese to each tortilla after the meat/sauce.  Offered sour cream, salsa, chopped tomatoes and shredded lettuce as toppers.  Family loves Beef and Beef Chimi's from this site and just prefers Chicken Enchiladas over there.  Sorry, won't be making this one again.

This recipe is delish!!!!! My family raved about this! The only changes i made was i bought a rotisserie chicken from the store and shredded it and i added sharp cheddar cheese to the tortilla 1st to help keep it all together so i wouldn't have to use toothpicks.  Next time i will try adding the yummy salsa mixture and raw chicken to the crock pot and cook it all day. If you haven't tried this recipe you must!

Really good. I added a can of green chiles when I added the salsa to chicken, no cinnamon and less chili powder. Brushed with olive oil and came out great!

These crisped up and were pretty tasty. My only problem (and it's my own fault) is I didn't have enough mild salsa for 2 cups. So I used 1 cup mild and 1 cup mango salsa which gave this an odd flavor. Also, I debated whether or not to use the cinnamon, so I was only going to use a small dash. But, once again, a mistake was made and I over-did the dash. So I didn't like the overall flavor of the chimis. I sprayed a cookie sheet with cooking spray, placed my chimis, and then brushed on some olive oil. Baked for 15 minutes, then flipped them and baked for another 5. Perfectly crispy. I'll definitely make these again!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  You can do a million different things with this.  For my first time I reduced the amount of chili powder because 1/4 cup seemed ridiculous and I omitted the water and cinnamon.  I skipped the blender all together as it didn't seem necessary.  Turned out very well.  I definitely had to turn the chimis so they would brown evenly.  Topped with queso blanco!  Very happy with this recipe and will make again.

This was a good, but SPICY, dish.  I omitted the water, and didn't put in a full 1/4 cup of chili powder.  The only chili powder I had was chipotle chili powder, so I'm not sure how much hotter it made the dish, but this was definitely spicy - and we like spice.  I upped the cumin a bit (because I love cumin), added a tiny bit of shredded jack cheese and baked for about 20 minutes.  It probably could have baked longer, but it was crunchy.  Served with guacamole, and it was gooood.

This was good - my husband liked it and even took leftovers for lunch, which considering he isn't a huge chicken fan, is a good indicator for this recipe. It took a lot longer than 15 minutes for it to get even a little crispy, and they were difficult to turn in the oven. I think I will cut the rolls in half next time for easier turning. I also didn't put the entire 1/4 cup of chili powder in, that just seemed way too much and since it was late, I didn't want to make something inedible. I just estimated the amount based on what I put in other similar dishes. All in all, I'll likely make this again. Thanks!

I followed this recipe as written with the following exceptions....  I ran out of chili powder so I used about 1/8 cup plus about 1 1/2 Tbl cayenne pepper (my husband likes spicy food, so it wasn't a problem).  I also omitted the water as others suggested.  Cheddar cheese was added on top of the chicken & beans before baking, and this turned out really tasty; you could use other cheeses and it would turn out just as well, I think.  There was well more than enough filling for six tortillas, so I ending up with eleven chimichangas.  I will try freezing the leftovers and reheating in the microwave.
My husband fried some of the prepared chimichangas while the rest were baked.  The resulting two tastes were different, as would be expected, but both ways turned out well.
All in all, I think this recipes is well worth making: one that I will certainly make again.  Next time I will omit the cinnamon (based on personal preference).  This recipe was a great use for leftover baked chicken from dinner a few nights ago!

Delicious!  I added fresh mushrooms, green peppers and some ketchup (because all I had was medium salsa- it had kick!!).  I took the other reviewer's advice and only put half the cinnamon.  It was great!  I also stirred in about a 1/4 C. sour cream and also added some shredded Salsa Montery Jack cheese, right before I spooned mix into tortillas!  Sprinkled with same cheese before baking.  Thanks!

These turned out good. The only changes were I only used 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. You had a vague hint in the background & it really added a depth to the flavor. I also sprinkled shredded cheddar over the top before baking.

My family and I didn't care for these. I think it was the cinnamon, it just didn't taste good. I like the idea of baking them  with the olive oil, they turned out nice and crisp. I will use that idea again, but make my own filling.

This is one of my husband's favorite dishes. He loves it when we have this for dinner - he refers to them as the "Chimi Bombs" because he's such a fan . The flavor is great - the cinnamon really gives it an very good kick. I have topped it with cheddar cheese and placed them in the oven. It also works to mix all ingredients in a food processor at the same time instead of having to mix it separately in a food processor. It also works to make the chicken mixture ahead of time - makes for a really fast meal.

This had a very unique, but definitely mexican taste. I was worried about the amount of chili powder AND the added cinnamon, but it all worked together. My Dad, the biggest critic usually, was very fond of this recipe.

Didn't care for this one at all.  I cut back the cinnamon (wisely, I think), but they never got crisp and the filling tasted tired.

Made these at 1am because I was craving something like this - only change I made was to mix the beans and chicken stuff together in the pan before filling the chimis. We just like it better mixed up than separate in the food. Absolutely LOVED them. Smothered them with the White Cheese Sauce on this site. YUM!

Way too saucy (even though I accidently left out the water) and sweet for my tastes, but my family said they enjoyed them.  If I make them again I will cut back on the salsa and either cut back drastically or completely omit the cinnamon, which ended up being pretty overpowering.  Any ideas about why it turned out so sweet and how to fix it??

Yum - these were great!  Took a few suggestions from others and cut back the amount of chili powder and spritzed the tortillas with olive oil.  Served with homemade guc.  Very, quick, easy, and filling.  Thanks Jeri

Didn't really taste like a chimichanga, but it still was good.  I used beef instead of chicken.  Took the advice of other reviews and reduced the chili powder (to only 1 1/2 Tbsp.) and broiled it in the oven.  This made it quite crispy and it was done in 10 minutes (I turned them over once during broiling and removed the toothpicks at that time).

This is a fabulous recipe!  It is now family favorite at our house.  I did add cheese to the chicken mixture before rolling up in the tortilla and that added a yummy touch!  I've passed this recipe on to just about everyone I know.  I also slow cooked the chicken breasts all day, which made for easier shredding.

Fabulous!

This was very tasty and easy to make.  Next time I am going to add a bit of cream cheese to the chimi before I roll it up.  I added cream cheese to the top, but I think putting it inside to melt will be better.

Yum! These turned out great. All of us enjoyed these - even the kids. I pretty much followed the recipe although I did add some cheese to the inside. I eyeballed the chili powder but I'm pretty sure I didn't use anywhere near 1/4 cup - didn't want to make them too hot because of the kids. I baked a little longer then 15 minutes to get them to crisp up. I would make these again.

This was a really yummy recipe however i did make a few modifications and also three different kinds. 1)instead of refried beans i used roasted garlic hummus, 2) due to lack of tortillas i used the burrito sized tortillas cut in half and folded like mini triangles, 3) i added bacon to one tray of these and bbq sauce to the other tray. They came out wonderful served w/sour cream and homemade guacamole DELISH!

side note:for the shredded chicken i brought water to a rolling boil, seasoned chicken breast w/salt&pepper coated with 2 teaspoons of veggie oil and also seasoned the water w/garlic&onion powder, salt&pepper & cumin as well, reduced water to a simmer dropped the chicken in and let simmer for about 45 minutes then shredded, chicken came out moist.

I made this for Mother's Day.  I don't like to eat out on the busiest day of the year, but don't want to spend the whole day cooking either.  I prepared the filling on Saturday so that it was assembly/baking only required on Sunday.  My kids had one bite and all I heard was raves and I want to make these!  My son was trying to guess what the seasonings were.  We all loved them.  I did not add the refried beans.  I had side dishes of pinto beans and Mexican rice. It is easy to make and so much better than restaurant chimichangas.

The family & I really enjoyed. Used a pack of taco mix as suggested by other reviewers. Made a pouch of Mexican Rice and added to the Chimi as welll as used Green Enchilada Sauce to add to the top because it looked too dry. Made an Avocado, Red Onion & Tomato salad on the side. We were happy at the end of the meal :)

My DH helped prepare this dish. I prefer corn tortillas and used them instead of the flour ones. Made it as written otherwise. Served with homemade guacamole and no-fat sour cream. 
A great dinner -- we'll make again.

My tweak was to make the chicken "piccadillo" by adding slivered toasted almonds, chopped green pimento-stuffed olives and currents to the chicken mix. Adds a nice crunch and sweet/sour flavor.

Yum! This dish was very good, but it was actually the method that caught my attention. I had cooked up a can of drained and rinsed black beans, corn, diced tomatoes, a poblano pepper and some spices and had also roasted a whole chicken. Wanting a good way to use them, I baked bean and chicken burritos like this recipe, topping with mozzarella cheese the last five minutes - for 20 minutes total. Delicious! And even better the second night when I used an olive oil cooking spray(a mister would be perfect). This method worked great even with gluten free tortillas, which makes them all the better - for me, anyway! Thank you for this great idea, Jeri. I will definitely be making this again and might even use your ingredients next time. lol

These were good, but only without the seasonings (ruined the flavor of the salsa) and pan-fried. The tortillas get way too crisp baked in the oven.

Just made this recipe and like others ending up only using taco seasoning, mainly because that's all I had on hand. I would definitely recommend coating the outside with the olive oil, it gives the tortilla's a nice crispy texture and they get flaky which I loved. I would suggest serving this with some queso fresco or regular queso to give it even more umph. Next time I'm going to try adding some corn to give the filling more texture.

These turned out great. Just like most reviewers I decreased chili powder to about 2 tsp. Skipped the beans and added just a bit of shredded cheese before folding. I did secure each chimi with a toothpick due to the need to turn over. Served with guac, salsa and sour cream. Bake time and temp. right on.

Overall, a good recipe. I would've like a bit more heat from something like green chilies or jalapenos. I liked the texture you get from puree-ing the ingredients for the filling; much better than just mixing it all together. I didn't pay much attention to how long it actually took to crisp them to my liking, especially since I extended the baking time to melt some cheese on top (after they were crisp). Yum! Leftovers re-crisp decently in the oven.

I cooked this for the second time today, minus the water, and it turned out great. The first time I used 8-inch tortillas & 1 was an ample serving. I accidentally bought 10-inch tortillas which makes for a huge chimichanga, so half of one will be a meal. On the back of the chi-chi's tortilla package was this same recipe including the blending instruction. Chi-chis called for 1/3 c chili powder & 4 T water which is too much.  Jeri, I think chi-chis ”borrowed” your delicious recipe! You ought to call them up and ask for a cut of their profits.

Really great recipe and very flavorful without being unhealthy like Mexican food can be. I did half in flour tortillas and half in corn tortillas since I really like the authentic flavor of corn and wanted to see which one turned out better. The corn ones fall apart pretty easily, but I think I liked them more. The flour tortilla ones were also excellent though. I agree with other reviewers that you need to watch the cinnamon...I put in half a teaspoon and it was borderline too much. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

These were super good for a baked chimi. They were crisp and I served them with shredded lettuce and guacamole. I did not use beans as I am not nuts about them. The chicken was really tasty!

Everything was good with the exception of the cinnamon.  It had a very distinct flavor which stood out which my husband and daughter immediately picked out. I'll try it again and leave that out.

I love this recipe!  The flavor of the sauce was great.  I managed to get this perfectly crisp by baking the chimis on a pampered chef stoneware pan.  They only had to be turned once.

Yum! While I LOOOVED these, my hubs (who btw, HAPPILY ate TWO chimi's) "gently" suggested a few (minor) improvements :) I have to agree with him to some extent. Although delicious as is, with a few minor tweaks these could be better. For one, we both agree that the cinnamon flavor was a bit overpowering (I'll cut back to 1/4 t next time). Second, NOTHING compares to the texture of an authentic, DEEP FRIED chimichanga - PERIOD! My husband requested that we deep fry ours next time and I second that. My hubs final comment was that our chimi's were a *tad* wet. I think that was my fault tho.... To speed prep, I purchased a Mexican-seasoned rotisserie chicken. Since I ended up with only 3/4 lb. of shredded meat, I cut back on the sauce but apparently not enough (oops!). :( NOTE: DO NOT brush your chimichangas with 2 T EVOO! A T of oil (better yet, melted butter) is PLENTY!!! You want to LIGHTLY coat each chimi. Otherwise, you'll end up with soggy chimi's or will have to bake FAR longer than 15 minutes in order for them to crisp up. I ended up having to pop mine under the broiler for 5 minutes (be sure to watch carefully!). Served atop a bed of shredded lettuce with some reserved sauce, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo and shredded Mexican-blend cheese on top. Mexican rice and tortilla chips rounded out our meal. Thanks for sharing, Jeri. This now tops my favorites list! :-)

great recipe! My whole family loved it. I cooked my chicken breast in the crock pot with some chicken broth. I used 2 lbs of chicken. I used a whole sweet onion & 4 cloves of garlic. I cut the cinnamon down to 1/4 tsp. When I was done with everything I loaded up the flour tortillas with the beans and chicken mixture, I sprinkled a little taco cheese on them and wrapped them. I didnt puree my chicken mixture and it was still perfect. We did freze the rest of the chimichangas. Thanks Again!

Great recipe.  I did cut the chili powder down from 1/4 c to 1 T, and also reduced the cinnamon to 1/4 t.  The taste was great, with plenty of spice.  I too did not blend the salsa, but enjoyed the different textures while eating.

This was a really nice recipe. I made per directions. I would imagine you can easily get away with not blending/processing the sauce. But I wanted to get a smooth sauce. I liked it very much. It was also relatively easy and quick to make.

My husband loved this recipe. The way I made it was a little too spicey for me. I did not bother to process this because I was in a hurry. I used a whole jar of organics chipotle salsa. I do not have chili powder so used  1 teaspoon smoked paprika scant 1/8th teaspoon cyan pepper. I used 2 chicken breasts and was not sure how much they weighed and 1 large can of refried beans. I could not find 10 inch totrillas so got the medium soft taco size and it ended up making about 14 chimis. I will make it again this way for my husband but maybe use mild salsa for me. 
We also used plain yogurt to dip ours in because we like sour cream but try to stay away from the fat.

Love this baked healthy version. I kept the cinnamon in and could totally taste it in the sauce but i loved it. Might do a 1/4 of a teaspoon. I brushed the tortillas in oil like another review suggested and was happy with it. I also left the beans out and just served them on the side.

Oh my is this recipe a keeper. I see why many of you make these over and over. I did not puree the salsa, onion, and garlic mix. I also did not add any water, I didn't want it runny. After I added the seasonings and chicken, I added the refried beans to the mix. It made the mixture VERY easy to handle as I loaded my tortillas. I only had 9 tortillas and this recipe would have easily made 12. I also added shredded cheese to the tortillas first, then added my filling.

Wow!The family absolutely loved it, kids included.  Took the advice of others and used rotisserie chicken, taco seasoning & can of corn drained.  I also used all the ingredients from recipe except cinnamon, chilli powder and water.  I used blk refried beans vs pinto. The  chicken mixture was so good kids kept using it as a dip for their chips while I was assembling the chimis for the oven. Super easy and yummy!!

These aren't the chimis you find at most Mexican restaurants, but they are great. I cut back on the cinnamon a little, and added some ancho chili powder in place of the regular chili powder--the smoky flavor it adds is great. Most of you are going to think this is strange, but adding cocoa to these gives it an authentic kick that is wonderful. Do spread the olive oil over the entire rolled tortilla after constructing them; it's important to making them crunchy and not soggy. When baking, keep them separated so they brown well.

These were ok. The cinnamon overpowered a little, though it worked with the other seasoning. I may try this again with just a few dashes of cinnamon.

The flavor was incredible!  But after 23 minutes in the oven, the tortillas still weren't golden crisp.  I ended up frying them for the crispy outer.  Loved the filling though.

A great way to use up leftover roasted chicken. I reduced the chili powder down to a teaspoon, tender tummies, but other than that, made it exactly per the recipe. Delicious.

I made this exactly as the recipe is supposed to be and while the whole basting with oil and baking idea was great and worked out well, for me and my family the cinnamon and chili powder was too much. I dont think Ill ever make these again, but if I did I would use 1/2 the amount of chili powder and very little cinnamon, if any.

My family loved this. We didn't have any garlic but it was fine without and I skipped the onion because my salsa had plenty in it already. I forgot to put the toothpicks in and so instead left them in the oven for ten minutes before turning only once so they were more set. I know at least one reviewer said they didn't like the beans because they made it soggy when reheated but I didn't have that problem at all and actually felt the beans made the leftovers. I'll definitely be making this again.
Edit: I made this again recently with ground beef instead of chicken. (I skipped the food processor as well this time around though I don't think that made much difference.) They were delicious, better than the chicken version, I think.

This is an awesome recipe to use up leftover chicken. I used a fresh salsa which I think made a big difference. I also saved a little time by throwing the cooked chicken in with the salsa mix when chopping it in the food processor. It really shredded the chicken in a jiffy.

Good dinner that I would make again if I had leftover baked chicken to use up.  I would recommend only 2 T. of chili powder for a little spiciness.   It comes together quite quickly.  I like that it only takes 15 minutes in the oven.

Good!  Like others, I cut waaaay back on the listed amount of chili powder.  I, too, cut back on the amount of cinnamon.  Like someone else said, I was afraid of the cinnamon!  But, yes it did give it a good - different - flavor.  I'm glad I didn't use any more than the amount I did, though.  I used about 1/4 tsp.  Everything else, I followed the recipe.  Pretty good!

So good! We had leftover rotisserie chicken and tortillas to use up. It's a five with my changes: omit cinnamon,  added chopped green chili peppers with the pureed salsa mixture; did not have refried beans so I used canned black breans (pureed). After baking, we topped it with shredded pepper jack cheese then transferred it back in the oven for a minute to melt  and voilà!

I made a chimi casserole instead of individual chimis because my tortillas would not roll (I think the humidity had something to do with that).  I used Homemade Flour Tortillas and Refried Beans without the Refry along with 2 cups of shredded chicken to make this.  I layered tortillas, beans, chicken, tortillas, beans, chicken, tortillas, salsa and baked.  It was great!  I was nervous about the amount of chili powder in the chicken, but when it all came together this tasted like something I'd get at a restaurant.  I'll definitely make this again (hopefully as individual chimis next time).

This was just OK. It has to much chili powder in it.  Next time I make this I will reduce the amount of chili powder and cinnamon and add cheese.

Loved it!  Made it almost as written.  The cinnamon did add a strange flavor..I didn't hate it, but will probably leave out next time.  We used whole grain tortilla's and fat-free refried beans.  The tortilla's toasted up nice, and it was a hit.  So glad to have a healthier version of one of my kids favorite meals!  Thanks for posting the recipe!!

We tried this recipe last night and we were not disappointed.  It was very tasty and easy to make!  We used hot salsa and only 1/4 tsp of chili powder.  We love spicy food, but 1/4 cup of chili powder seems like WAY too much.  We also didn't blend up the salsa mixture, just added the chicken to it as is.  Towards the end of the baking time, we sprinkled shredded cheese on top (marble was all we had on hand) and let it bake a little more.  We had low fat sour cream on the side to dip.  Delish!  We will definitely be making this again!

I make this as is sometimes (always add cheese and never puree, though) and sometimes I take the quick route and just make as quesadillas.  Instead of brushing with oil, I use cooking spray.  For a good dipping sauce, mix together some sour cream and taco sauce.  Reheats well for lunch the next day.  During the last month of my pregnancy, I made these like a pan of enchiladas and froze for a reheat-and-heat meal after the baby was born.  There are a lot of options with this recipe!

Delicious and easy meal, well received by the whole family! However, instead of using salsa (because it is a different in New Zealand, two cups of it would be way to much!) used a can of Chilli and Garlic tomatos, omitting the crushed garlic and water from the recipe. Also, threw some chopped bell pepper in with the onion before adding the tomatos/salsa. Didn't wizz it in the blender, as I prefer the chunky texture. Cooked chicken beforehand with cajun spice, which worked really well. Also sprinkled cheese on top after last turn in the oven. Awesome flavor, will make again!

Super Score!  With three boys to please, this recipe works for the entire family.  I had extra mixture, so I made 8 Chimis and still had more for leftovers the next night.  I added cheese, and basted an extra 10 minutes.  I think next time I will try the taco seasoning, but I won't give up the different flavor with the cinnamon.  Thank you!

Absolutely delicious!  Very easy to make, though I used 1.25 tbsp of chili powder rather than the 1/4 cup the recipe calls for.  I used Old El Paso tortillas for burritos which were a smidge on the small side (I used leftover refried beans as 'glue' to keep them sealed shut) so next time I will look for bigger wraps.  Will absolutely make this again - can't wait to eat the ones I've frozen!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good and very easy. As others did...substituted 1/4 cup taco seasoning instead of all the spices, added cheese, used canned chicken, did not puree and baked 20 minutes on each side.

This is more liked a baked burrito. Mine never did get really crispy. I did not use water or the spices. I used picante sauce (Chi Chi's) and 2 tablespoons of taco seasoning. The picante sauce worked well and did not need to be blended. It is not as chunky as salsa. Definitely add cheese to it. Everyone ate it and said it was good but I don't know if I would make again.

This was great! I didn't add the cinnamon though. I also did not blend the mixture before adding chicken. I didn't think it was really necessary. I added a little cilantro and cheese before rolling up. Will definitely make this again! Thanks!

My husband didn't think these were bad but I thought the recipe called for way too much chili powder.  It overpowered everything else.  I made my kids cheese quesadillas because they wouldn't eat this.

These were pretty good. I don't think I have ever had an authentic chicken chimichanga before so I don't have anything to compare them to. Also, I made a lot of alterations. I put a little garlic and onion powder on the chicken before I grilled it on my George Forman grill and then shredded it per the recipe. I did cut the chili powder in about a third and increased the cumin by just a pinch or two. I omitted the cinnamon as I didn't have any on hand.  Also, I added a few TBS of cream cheese to the chicken mixture. I did not put it in the food processor either and it was fine. I spread the beans down center of tortilla as directed; topped with chicken mixture and a sprinkle of cheddar cheese. I folded the tortillas up wrap style by first folding top and botton edges and then folding the sides around them. brushed lightly with EVOO put seam side down in a baking dish.  There was no need for toothpicks. I only turned them once half way through and they stayed together fine. All that said, and the filling a little different than the recipe states... good recipe. Will make again! Thank you for the recipe.

This was really good!!  I hesitated about the cinnamon but put it in anyway.  My husband raved about these, he is so picky when it comes to food.  This one is a keeper!

Awesome flavor although next time will lighten up on the chili power just a tad. I also added some shredded cheese to the mixture before folding up the chimis. Will keep on the best hits list :)

Wow!These were great. My family devoured them in no time. They have a great flavor. I did changed a few things. I skipped the blender part. To save time and I didn't see a point in it. I also added a can of el pato jalepeno sauce, because I didn't quite have enough salsa. I also added cheese on the inside and on top the last couple of minutes of baking.

I made this for the first time and I followed the recipe (except I added cheese) and they were great!  Not as hot as my husband and I like things but perfect for the person who wants flavor but not a lot of heat.  I added cheese at the very end for the last 5+ minutes they were in the oven.  Next time I will add a little more heat to them but other than that they are GREAT!

This was better than I expected. The cinnamon added a very delicious twist. My kids really liked this recipe, even my extremely picky 6 year old. I didn't wrap the burrito according to the recipe, I used 7 inch tortillas and just wrapped them taquito style (just a little bigger) and I used 10 torillas. I didn't have to use the tooth picks this way.

at first, i was skeptical to try this recipe, but i'm so glad i did! my husband and i LOVED this recipe. i improvised a little because we love LOTS of flavor so... i added 1/4 - 1/2 taco seasoning packet to the chicken before adding it to the salsa. also, i used 1 cup salsa in a blender and added 1/2 onion ,1 clove garlic, 1 jalepeno, 1 tomato, juice and zest of 1/2 lemon/lime so that the salsa is actually very flavorful, fresh and delicious. i sprinkled shredded chedder cheese on top right before pulling them out of the oven. wonderful authentic taste! kudos, even as is, this recipe would have been great!

I probably used more garlic than most, but that is to suit my own family preference.  The only other thing that I did was add cheese on top of my meat & bean mixture. 

These were really easy for me and they tasted great!  I will be making them again and again.  It is just as good as our local Mexican restaurant and cheaper, too!

My family BEGS me to make this for them - I usually double the recipe because they want some for leftovers, too.  I add 1 t. of dried cilantro, and I top with Mexican blend shredded cheese for the last 5 minutes of baking.

So Yummy!!!  I cut the oil out completely and just used Pam and chicken broth instead (no need for the extra fat and calories in an otherwise healthy recipe) and substituted whole wheat tortillas for the regular flour torts.  I cut back on the spices per other reviewers comments.  DO NOT cut the cinnamon out!  It adds such a wonderful flavor!  Great Chimis!

This recipe made the BEST Mexican dish that I can eat yet.  My wife loved them so much, that she told everyone at her job about it, and now they all want me to make a batch of them for a potluck they are having.  Thank you Jeri.

I wasn't a big fan of this one.  I bought shredded chicken to save time.  I wish we would've left the cinnamon out, but I won't be making it again to see if that makes these taste any better.

Not too bad, but WAY too much chili powder.  I would cut the chili powder at least in half if not more. My fiance said he did not know what chili powder tasted like until I made these last night for dinner.  If you cut way down on the chili powder, then they are pretty good.

Good healthier version of the deep-fried chimi.  The cinnamon was different, but added a nice depth to the recipe.  I used my spray oil instead of brushing with olive oil, and turned out nice and crisp.

My family thought this was good.  My only recommendation is to make sure you separate the chimi's for leftovers before you put them in the fridge.  They are very hard to separate once they are cold.

These were a hit and so easy to make!  Made me feel a lot better about eating chimi's that weren't deep fried!  I'm always looking for baked versions of fried dishes and this one is a keeper!

This was just ok..it would have been better leaving all the spices out..I cut the cinnamon in half per other reviews & it still had way too much of a cinnamon flavor......probably won't make this again.

I made two Mexican chicken recipes tonight and this one was the loser. I reduced the recipe for two servings and something went terribly wrong regarding the cinnamon. It was overpowering instead of being a subtle background flavor. My chimi did crisp up nicely in the oven and I only turned once. Served with sour cream.

The only change I made was in not transfering the mixture to a food processor and blending until smooth.  Like a previous reviewer, and because most often I am only cooking for 1, I froze some for later.

This was awesome!  I didn't put the salsa mixture in the food processor because I was trying to speed up the prep time.  Actually, I think I prefer having the salsa whole.  Like other reviewers, I cut back on the amount of chili powder used.  Also, since I had so much other food in the fridge to eat up, I put these in freezer bags to have handy as quick treats/dinners.  I defrosted it in the microwave, then put it in the toaster oven for crispiness.  In the last couple of minutes, I added cheese on top.  Tasted just as good after being frozen as it was when it was fresh.

I was so excited to find this recipe again after making it a few times a few years ago.  I never added the cinnamon, cumin or chili powder when I made it before, but I will take the suggestion of using taco seasoning when I make it tonight.  My family always loved this one.

I made this for dinner last night and was quite impressed.  It was very spicy which is exactly what I was looking for.  After I took them out of the oven, I sprinkled some shredded cheese on top and served with sour cream, salsa and lettuce.  I will definitely make this one again!

This recipe is so hard to review.  WHILE I was making it, I was thinking "this is such a pain, I will not do this again".  With getting out the food processor, cleaning it up, assembling the chimis (which I made a mess of) etc.  BUT, the end result was SO good!  They tasted wonderful.  I get tired of the loads of cheese on most mexican food, this was a welcome change.  I did spread some of my tortillas with cream cheese.  That was really tasty, even though you normally wouldn't find it in a recipe like this.  Thank you Jeri, for the messy, yet delicious recipe!

This was such a nice change.  I made different fillings so that everyone had something to try.  The original recipe is fabulous but I made some chicken and cheese filling so that my toddlers would eat too. I also used some green chilis and cheese as a filling.  I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks Jeri!

It was very good. The cooking time in the oven was a bit too long, or the temperature was too high, as the filling was scorching hot and took forever to become cool enough to eat. I would lower the temperature next time so that it only crisps the tortilla, without over heating the filling.

I made this recipe for dinner last night and my whole family (two are very picky eaters) and EVERYONE loved it. It is easy to fix and tastes great. Serve with some Spanish rice, sour cream, guacamole, salsa and you've got a meal.

I did not like this at all. I added cheese and cut way down on the chili powder and it still had a spicy-bland flavor. Yuck.

I was pretty disappointed with how this recipe turned out.  We significantly cut down on both the chili powder and the cinnammon, but the flavor was still overpowering.  I think I would be willing to try this recipe again, but with quite a few adjustments to the spices - probably no cinnammon at all - and maybe a cheesier/creamier filling.

This recipe was great.  I followed some other suggestions.  I just used a packet of taco seasoning instead of the spices, it was wonderful.  Also, instead of brushing with oil, I just sprayed it with cooking spray.  It turned out crispy and delicious.

These were pretty good.  I don't think that they were worth the extra preparation time.  I definitely did not add all the chili powder.  That has to be a misprint.  Didn't really taste like a chimichanga, but they weren't bad.  Thanks.

I agree with disneygirl, it didn't really taste like a chimi, but it was very good. My youngest son loved it. My husband suggested cutting back on the chili powder, and everyone wants cheese added to it.

This turned out great. I did make a few changes. I reduced the chili powder. I didn't have the salsa so I used 1 can Rotel tom/cil/lime. I baked my chicken then cubed added to sauce pan with water to cover added some chili powder, cuman and garlic salt. Boiled down then shredded. I layered each Tort with refried beans, chicken mix and then cheese. I also used veggie olive since I was out of olive oil. Worked great. The kids went back for seconds. Things alot for a great recipe with little oil being used.

This is an absolutely delicious meal.  Goes great with some Refried beans on the side, or even with green beens.  I suggest trying 1/4 tbsp of chili powder and hot salsa.

chimichangas are my favorite so i was skeptical, but these were great! like others suggested i used extra large tortillas and without a doubt added cheese! the only other change i made was to expedite the browning process by broiling them for 2-3 minutes (they weren't browning quick enough for me). the rolling process is a little work, but if you can get through it, they're worth it. they taste very similar to the real chimi and they're much healthier. will definitely make again.

These were wonderful!  My husband and 9 year old loved them.  My only change was to add a little cheddar cheese to the chimis before I wrapped and cooked them.  Great recipe!

Very tasty. We used the whole 1/4 cup of chili powder, and it wasn't too spicy.  We, like other posters, added some cheese to the recipe.

My family loved this recipe. My daughter suggested we back off on the cinnamon but I liked it. There is a lot of chili powder in the sauce but not too much in my opinion. Overall, they looked great and tasted even better.

Great recipe.  Wonderful flavor.  Sauce is so versital.  We used it on quesadillas and tacos.  Wonderful flavor gets more intense if left in fridge overnight.  The chimis can even be cooked on an electric griddle for 3 - 4 minutes if you want it quicker.

These were terrific!  Like some others, I added a little cheese and reduced the chili powder just slightly.  I also used refried beans with green chiles in them for a little added Mexican flare. Excellent!  I can't wait to make them again.

These were great. I didn't follow the recipe exactly (didn't puree the mixture, added frozen corn and used mashed black beans and chick peas instead of refried beans) but it was a great inspiration and my husband loved them. Thanks

Too spicy for my kids!  I added shredded cheddar cheese inside and a little over the top.  Delicious!

First, I heated the tortillas in the mw  - they are much easier to work with. Second, isn't 1/4 cup chile powder a little much (I used 1/4 tsp.) As I thought, this recipe makes enough for way more than 6!

They were good but reminded me of burrito's.  I was looking for a crisp shell and

After I made this, I started craving chimichangas!  I even tried a bean and cheese filling for a quick lunch and that was good.  Next time I make this, I will leave out the cinnamon (personal preference).

A wonderful recipe with great flavor when finished.  However, they are a little tough to roll and keep together as the juices from the meat hamper things a bit I am sure that with practice and bigger (giant) tortillas they would be great.

I basically followed the recipe but took the lazy way out. I put some frozen chicken thighs in the pressure cooker for 12 minutes and then shredded those once cooled. I mixed the shredded chicken with a cup of restaurant style salsa, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin salt and pepper. I omitted the cinnamon just out of preference. I spread some refried beans along the middle of each 16 inch tortilla, topped with the chicken mixture and finally some Mexican shredded cheese. I folded and baked in a 9x13 inch dish sprayed with Pam. I did coat the chimis in olive oil. Served with sour cream. My husband announced it was his favorite!  My kids wolfed them down. This will be on the regular rotation.

This was a hit at my house last night! I didn't bother pureeing the sauce. I used black beans instead of refried since that's what I had on hand, and added a little cheese (about 2 tbsp) to each one. I made 4 chimis, and should have made 5 (they were huge!), but I think if I made 6, they'd have been too small. Delicious flavor!

My whole family thought this was delicious, even my husband who I find a little trickier to cook for. I doubled the recipe except for the chili powder and cinnamon, leaving them at their original amounts. I liked the way the tortillas crisped up a bit with the oil brushed on, though of course they don't exactly copy the texture of something fried. My youngest kids found this to be a bit spicy with the medium salsa I used, even though they like it on chips, so I'll try mild next time. We added shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, lettuce and tomatoes on top.  This will definitely go into our regular meal rotation, especially as my teen boys were thrilled to have leftovers to pack for school lunches.

Very easy, I usually pick up a roasted chicken from the grocery store to make this a quick prep meal.   Served with some homemade guac and some sour cream and it's great.

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I made it exactly as the recipe states, but did not secure the tortillas with a toothpick nor turn them. The spices just weren't to my family's taste, but the tortilla shells came out crispy and everyone ate them. I will use an altered version of this recipe again, but will try taco seasoning and add cheese, and perhaps leave out the refried beans.

I feel like I need to review this twice, since my experience was completely different than my husband's. I had to cut the cinnamon and cumin in half jut so he try them. Thanks to the amazing Hatch salsa I used, that was plenty for me. He claiimed they were "fine", and would have been inedible with the full amount. I loved them. I made them with 10" flour tortillas and spread the layers about 1/4" thick by 2" wide, leaving plenty of free ends to fold over. Then folded each naked end piece over. No toothpicks needed - I just placed them carefully fold side down in a well oiled pan (Pam will not cut it here), and let them crisp completely before turning, about 10 minutes. Cooked another 10 minutes and they were perfect! Served with a dollop of sour cream, shredded lettuce, and diced tomatoes kind of on top and falling off to one side. The presentation was lovely and the flavor combo perfect.

I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa and it turned out more like enchiladas, which I didn't mind. They still tasted good. What seems difficult with this recipe is turning the chimis even with the toothpicks. May stick to the enchilada way.

really liked these, added some shredded cheese inside the chimi  before rolling and some queso over the top when eating.  Doug loved the spices just as they were (used 1/2 the amount of the chili powder and cinnamon), but I wonder how they'd taste using a taco seasoning packet- may try that next time.

Overall this is a very good recipe, but there were key parts that didn't fit my family's taste.   I will mostly likely make this again but I will completely omit the cinnamon.   We did not care for that in the recipe at all.   I thought the cumin and chili powder were just right.   I don't think I would blend the salsa mix again.   I felt that was just an extra unnecessary step.   The other issue I had was that the filling needs more of something.   I'm not sure whether fried rice or tomatoes or something, but it needs more.   Lastly I doubled the amount of refried beans in the chimis.   As written there was just a trace.   The base of the recipe is excellent and I will use again.

Very good! If your tortillas come raw, make sure to cook them before putting them into the oven. Also, I did not use any toothpicks to hold them together, I did not want holes that juices could leak out of. Instead, just make sure they are folded well, and put the fold on the underside when cooking.

I followed other reviewers' advice by adding some cheese before rolling up the tortillas, and also used less chili powder. I also didn't puree my salsa, simply because the brand I was using (Trader Joe's) was not chunky at all.  These turned our GREAT!!  Restaurant quality, in my opinion!  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  Cooked two large chicken breasts in my crock pot, shredded them and added all other ingredients with the exception of onion/garlic (since I don't like either).  Cut the chile powder in half and upped the salsa to two jars of a famous local restaurant brand.   After baking, garnished with Colby/jack cheese, lettuce, chopped tomato, sour cream and fresh guacamole.  I live in NM where we enjoy everything spicy!

Definitely a keeper and so versatile as well.   LOVE Allrecipes because I can  almost always improve on a recipe from reading the comments and did just that.  1/4 cup of chili powder would never have worked for us.  I just used some lower sodium taco seasoning like another reviewer for the spices  and since we had mexican corn with jalapenos also used a little of that on the beans and some shredded cheese.  Even though we were reluctant to brush oil on the tortillas we did on top only and it made them delicious.  We never turned them over and only baked them about 8-10 minutes.  DELICIOUS!!!   We loved the chicken shredded in the salsa/onion mixture and will use what was left over on top of rice or black beans for lunch tomorrow. (did not use the cinnamon because could not see it in the recipe)  EASY satisfying meal!!!

Recipe shows promise, but the spices are way too concentrated.  Next time... cut chili powder in half, omit cinnamon, and add a layer of cheese between beans and chicken.

I made this with leftover chicken taco meat from the crockpot and used mashed pinto beans because we were out of refried beans and it came out awesome.  Out of toothpicks too!

I had better luck browning the tortillas with the oven set to broil for the last 5-10 minutes. To recapture the crispiness on leftovers, microwave about two minutes (so your insides aren't cold), then brown in a nonstick skillet (or any other skillet, if you add a little oil) for just a few minutes. Other minor tweaks: reduce chili powder to just a sprinkle and make up the difference with paprika, if your family doesn't love things spicy. You can also substitute the salsa for canned tomatoes (with chilies, if you want it spicier) and a little salt to make it more economical. I also serve the beans on the side (2/3 of my kids don't like them) instead of inside, along with cheese, sour cream, etc. for a "build your own" experience.

Amazing burritos. I do recommend starting off with less chili powder, especially if you get a salsa you like. I thought mine added enough flavor with just half the chili powder in the recipe. Just taste the sauce before you fill the tortillas and add more if you want more! The cinnamon adds a lot of depth, I don't recommend cutting it out. If the person eating it doesn't know it's in there, it'll be hard to identify for most people. I'll be adding some jalapeno's to mine next time.

My family loved this dish, even my teenage daughter who doesn't like most dinners I cook. I made modifications to the amount of salsa (1 cup) and chili powder (1 tablespoon) and eliminated the cinnamon, as suggested by others. I also warmed the tortillas on a comal before filling and baked on convection to ensure crisp texture. I sprinkled a little grated cheese on top right after baking. Will definitely make these again.

Best recipe we've ever made. Great with the addition also of some chopped up chipotle peppers to the sauce. Top with some sour cream and chopped cilantro and you've got a meal fit for royalty.

I had too much mix for the 6-10" tortillas. I stuffed them, but then they were difficult to properly close. I'd do 10 tortillas next time. I did blend the ingredients but next time will cut the chili powder in 1/2 (just too much). I also used almost a can of re-fried beans. When it says 1/2 beans, 1/2 mix, you will use more than a cup, and what would you do with the leftovers anyway? Baking didn't get mine crisp on ALL sides in 20 minutes, so I might try frying mine next time as well. All kids liked it which is an accomplishment at my house. I'm always looking for a way to use my chicken after making broth (which has been cooked all day) and THIS uses it superbly!

So so good! Such a simple and flavorful recipe, these will be in my regular rotation. I didn't bother blending the sauce (didn't want to dirty another bowl!) and thought that once you added the shredded chicken you couldn't tell if the sauce had been blended or not anyways. I used whole wheat tortillas and finished by adding a bit of Monterey Jack cheese on top in the last couple minutes of baking.

Loved it and I rated it without the beans as some suggested.  It might be good with the beans.  The cinnamon was good, but I was worried it wouldn't be.  I think I will add either drained black beans to the chicken in the future, or add "Best Spanish Rice" from this site, to the chicken.  I sprinkled cheese on top after they cooked.  Wonder if cheese might be good inside.

Great recipe!  I used only 1 Tbsp chili powder, and 1 1/2 C salsa.  That was plenty of chili flavor for us!  I made the Rush Hour Refried Beans on this site, and shredded leftover baked chicken.  My mixture filled 7 fajita size flour tortillas, which fit perfectly in a 9x13 pan.  Brushed canola oil all over, and they browned very nicely in about 20 min!  Served with guac, very tasty, although they would definitely be amazing with cheese melted on top too!

These were delicious and with one tweak they would be five stars. I believe they need Mexican cheese. I served with best Spanish rice from this site and guacamole.

Don't eliminate the cinnamon!  It's an essential ingredient.  I, too, reduced the chili powder and instead of refried beans, used black beans.

Thank you for posting this recipe.  My family loved it! I reduced the cinnamon, and used white & dark meat. I added cheese on the tortilla before rolling it.  Since we could not consume the whole batch, I wrapped each unbaked chimi on a tin foil & freeze. As soon as we decided to have chimi again for dinner, I moved the chimi from freezer to the cooler/ref the morning of to thaw.  Easy dinner.

I cooked the chicken in 2 tsp of olive oil and 2 tsp of hot pepper oil. Garlic, onion and sun dried tomatoes. Don't put the tomatoes in too early as they will burn.

Good recipe, but.....I would prefer them fried. I tried to crisp them up in the oven, but could not achieve the desired results. The cinnamon does add an interesting flavor, though my husband was not a fan. We had a lot of leftovers, so I froze them, and we will use them on top of tortilla chips, and make nachos.

Huge hit with the family!! I used half mild and half medium salsa and halved the chili powder but used all the cinnamon and cumin--it tasted great! I eliminated the water and still found the mixture too liquidy--needed to strain it a bit. I did not bother turning the chimis and they still crisped up nicely. Everyone said that this was a "definite make-again recipe"! Thanks!

This was a delicious and easy recipe! I only had about a cup and a half of salsa so I added some extra water. I didn't purée the mixture bc I like chunky veggies and didn't want to have to clean that too! Instead of using the spices (I was going to omit the cinnamon), I used a taco mix packet that I had on hand. To finish it off, I threw some shredded cheddar and about half a can of black beans into the filling. We only had whole wheat flour tortillas so I wrapped them up, topped them with some of the leftover sauce, some mexi-cheese and baked for about 6-7 minutes. Fantastic! My husband was way impressed and decided we would add this into our regular rotation. Thanks!

So good!  The hint of cinnamon made all the difference.  Will definitely make again.  Maybe next time add cheese inside the tortilla?  I also added a sprinkling of garlic salt on top of the oiled tortillas before they were baked.  Yum!

We loved the idea of these chimi's (and liked the crispy tortilla shell). However, we didn't like the flavor of the filling. I want to make these again, but I will search the reviews for an alternative filling. It seemed too sweet and had an odd flavor I couldn't identify.

We enjoyed these.  I cut the chili powder in half and left out the cinnamon.  Also didn't puree the salsa mixture.  I had really small tortillas, so I got 8 out of this and they were hard to flip so I just baked for 10 minutes and that was great.

The amount of chili powder in this is quite ridiculous!  I have had much better mexican fare.  The sauce overpowered the chicken, I thought and other than the chili powder, there wasn't a lot of taste.  Though not bad per say, I would never make this again.

This has potential, but needs a lot of tweaking for our taste.  Too much salsa, leave out the water, less chili powder, no cinnamon, more cumin, and top with the White Cheese Sauce from this site.  I am going to try it anyway.

This recipe is OK, but nothing I couldn't improvise on my own. Also, to make this truly restaurant-style you'll have to add more fillings besides just spiced chicken and refried beans. A good start, but needs tinkering.

The sour cream and refried beans off-set the spicy flavour, so I didn't find that the recipe called for too much chili powder.  Like some other reviewers, I added cheese to them.  I recommend extra large tortillas for easier bundling.

I will make this again.  I do like how the tortillas get nice and crisp in the oven.  I agree with others though; you only need 1/4 cup of chili powder.  I used 12 oz. of chicken not 2 ounces!! I think that must be an error. And the Monterey Jack or shredded cheddar on top may add some fat but it is worth that special touch!

Was more like a plain burrito, but chicken mixture was very good and would make again.

This is a quick, delicious and less-fattening way to enjoy chimichangas.  I added colby/monterey jack cheese, though.  The mixture thickened a bit when pureed, so it wasn't as runny.  The cinnamon was an awesome touch!  I used 1/8 cup of chili powder, instead, and my boyfriend complained that I should have used more - but then, the spicier, the better, for us!  These were crispy,  healthy, easy to make and overall really good.  I'll make them again and again!

I thought the cinnamon in this recipe made it unedible.  WAY to much chile powder.  I will make several revisions to this recipe before I use it again.

I thought this was a great idea. The chicken turned out a bit too saucy to make neat chimichangas, but it was still tasty, just more like enchiladas or something. VERY GOOD!
