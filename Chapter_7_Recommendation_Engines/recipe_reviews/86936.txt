These meatballs were great and everyone in the house loved them -- especially the 12yo, who said they were awesome.  For the sauce, I did cut the brown sugar in the glaze in half as recommended by others, and it could have been reduced even more.  With half the recommended amount of brown sugar, the sauce is still very sweet, maybe too sweet.  I'd recommend starting with about a quarter of the recipe amount of brown sugar and working your way up from that.  (Another idea is to make the meatballs without the glaze and use your favorite BBQ sauce instead.)  As for quantity of sauce, you really don't need to smother the meatballs, so I don't think doubling the sauce is really necessary.  For the meatballs themselves, I substituted 2% milk for the evaporated milk to lower fat grams, and it was fine.  I used regular Old-Fashioned Oats rather than quick cooking, and the oats cooked up just fine.

I actually cooked these in the slow cooker on low for about 6 hours. I added an entire bottle of bbq sauce also. They were very good and easy to make.

Absolutely delicious.  Smelled amazing while they were cooking and tasted just as good.  I only used about 1/3 cup of sugar, and it was plenty sweet.  Didn't have any evaporated milk, so I just used a splash of skim, and it worked fine.  They had a great texture-- nice and firm and no falling apart.  I think I will make extra sauce next time.  Will definitely make again.

I left out the evaporated milk to make the recipe "kosher-friendly", and my family just LOVED them! Went great with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans! Will definitely make it again.

These were terrific. 

Instead of the homemade sauce, I used 1 1/4 cup of KC masterpiece.  I also added extra seasoning salt and garlic.  Make sure to use good quality ground round or ground chuck.    

I also later did a pan with marinara sauce and topped with parmesan and mozzerela when finished.  It made excellent sub sandwiches..

These were a big hit at a party we had, with either sauce.

These were great! We had friends over for dinner and ate almost the entire pan! I used worcestershire sauce in lieu of the liquid smoke per my husband's request, but will probably try it the original way next time. It didn't have much of a "bbq" taste, it tasted a lot like my meatloaf. Will also have to double the sauce next time as was previously recommended. I was concerned because the balls were so mushy when I was shaping them, but the cooked texture was perfect. ***UPDATE - I have since made these with the liquid smoke, and doubled the sauce. WOW, I have to change my rating from 4 to 5 stars!!!

These were excellent! I doubled the recipe for a potluck, and they were so good. Very moist, and the sauce got nice and sticky. The only change I made was adding dried minced onions to the glaze instead of raw, because I used all the raw onion in the meatballs and didn't want to cut more. These will definitely be part of the rotation in my house!

These meatballs made for a family pleasing meal.  I prepared these weeks before we actually had them, and then stuck them in the freezer.  The night before we had them for dinner, I put them in the fridge and then the slow cooker the next morning with the sauce poured over.  Six hours later, they were tender, juicy, and ready to eat.  My husband and one daughter had these on hoagie rolls, and the rest of us enjoyed them over white rice.  Considering how easy they were to make, freeze, and prepare, we will be having these again.

The sauce for these meatballs was really good! Although it was a tad too sweet. I simply added a tablespoon of mustard and it was perfect. The meatballs themselves were disappointing tho. Even with all the spices, they turned out to be pretty bland. If I ever make again, I will surely up the dosage for the spices. The bbq sauce is a keeper tho!

I didn't realize it until I started reading the recipe closely but I've been making this recipe for years! It has been circulating in my family and is IDENTICAL except for 3 things. 1) substitute half of the oatmeal for cracker crumbs (I smash up saltines). Helps with the stickiness and gives it  a nice texture. 2)I almost always uses Bullseye. Very yummy and doesn't have high fructose corn syrup. Easier too, of course! 3) My family has make ahead directions (something I wish EVERY recipe had!!)! I often double the recipe and freeze them. I roll them into large balls and put them on a dinner plate that has wax paper on it. I let them freeze for about 45 minutes and then put them in a ziploc freezer bag and add another batch to freeze. If you don't freeze long enough they mush together in the bag. If you freeze too long they freeze onto the wax paper and plate and they're a huge pain to peel off.  When you need them plop them right onto a pyrex dish with wax paper underneath, coat with lots of bbq sauce and cook for 70 or so minutes at 350....maybe longer depending on the size of the meatballs. Sooo easy!! I have a batch sitting in my freezer right now in case of emergency!

Really good! I used extra lean ground turkey instead of beef and skim milk instead of the evaporated (about 1/4c). After I cooked the meatballs, I froze them for later in the week. I threw the frozen meatballs in the crockpot, made and poured the sauce on top and cooked on low for about 6 hours. Smell was amazing. I also decreased the brown sugar t 1/3c which was plenty sweet. I also added 1 tsp of liquid smoke instead of the full tablespoon. So yummy, will make again.

Delicious!!  My son said "Make this again".  For the meatballs I used regular oats and milk as that is what I had.  The sauce was a bit of an adventure as I wanted to make 1.5 times the recipe and I didn't have enough ketchup (about 3/4 cup).  I ended up adding a bit of barbecue sauce and then a small can of tomatoe paste and a can of water.  Used about 1/3 cup of onion, 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Was still delicious in spite of my patching it together.  Thanks!

Wasn't really sure if I should give this a 3 or a 4. It gets a 4 because my pickiest child enjoyed them. I read some reviews before making this and decided to go with half the brown sugar. I'm glad I did because I did find them too sweet even with half what the recipe called for.

We all loved these meatballs.  Just a shade too much liquid smoke for my taste so next time I'll use a tad less.  I baked half the recipe and fried the other half on the stove for a quicker meal.  Both were good--the baked were better.  Thanks for the post!

My husband and daughter really liked these, but even using only a quarter of the sugar called for, they found them too sweet. Although I made only half the recipe for the meatballs and the full amount of sauce, both of them said they would have liked more sauce. I will make these again, with those changes, though. Thanks!

It has to much evap. milk in recipe. I had to add more oats to compensate. The meatballs tasted very bland and they burned on the bottom.  Dissapointing.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I would - they were delicious, and relatively easy to make! My husband could hardly stop eating them. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the glaze/sauce; the only other thing I would change is to cut back on the sugar (I only used 3/4 cup instead of the full cup, and we still found it a little too sweet). I know I will be making these often, and with more sauce.

So yummy!  I didn't have liquid smoke OR evaporated milk when I made these, so I had to improvise a little, however, we absolutely loved these!  Next time I am going to make a bunch and freeze them so we always have them on hand.

This is the only recipe for meatballs I will use and I will hand it down to my children when they are old enough. Perfect. Will make double the sauce next time. Heck I'll make double the recipe and freeze some ! Definitely a keeper. Served them with basmati rice. Very tasty meatballs. I had to substitute a touch of cream for the milk. Awesome !

One of the BEST meatballs I've ever eaten!  My whole family and everyone we've served them to loves them.  I've discovered that it also makes a wonderful meatloaf - in fact, my husband almost prefers it that way!  I do use regular whole milk instead of evaporated, and I decrease the sugar in the barbecue sauce a little.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!

Not a hit with either of us I'm afraid.  Too much milk, and overcooked even at 40 minutes. I used my favorite barbecue sauce from Memphis, however, and was very pleased with that part of these.

The guys gave this 5 stars.  My husband really liked the BBQ glaze and said he would even enjoy it over meatloaf.  My little guy asked for a second one and ate everything.  He said they were "delicious."  So, I have to conclude that this a great recipe deserving of 5 stars and will be made again in my house!

Very good.  Made these for my husband and his friend for the game which 2 lbs of meat and they ate them all.  Baked the meat in the oven and then threw everything in the crockpot.  That worked well.

These are GREAT!  I usually make up a double/triple batch of these, bake what we need and freeze the rest.  We have even skipped the BBQ sauce and used them in spaghetti sauce, WONDERFUL!  My kids eat these up much better than meatloaf!

We LOVED this recipe!  I brought it to game night and had so many compliments on it!  I added more garlic and I also used 2% milk instead of evaporated milk.  (didn't have it on hand)  It came out so tasty! I baked them this time, I think next time, I'm going to try and use my new crock pot I just bought!

My family LOVED this recipe. Best meatballs i have ever made. My three year old asked for second and i have a hard time getting him to eat one serving. I did substitue oatmeal for plain bread crumbs and used spaghetti sauce and made baked spaghetti with them. will be making many many more times. best ever!!!!

My rating is just for the sauce as I had already made my meatballs.  I made the sauce and simmered it and then added my meatballs.  Served them at a wedding for 180 guests.  The sauce is fabulous just as is.  Perfect blend of flavors.  Everyone loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly with no changes.  The meatballs have the WORST texture and made them inedible.  The BBQ sauce was ok but a little sweet for me.

Fantastic! I don't eat red meat, I made this as an appetizer for my son's birthday party, it was a big hit! Everyone loved these meatballs! As suggested by Tat2, I made a few changes: I added a little worceshire sauce to the meat, reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, halved the amount of liquid smoke and added cruched Ritz crackers instead of oatmeal. I used a cookie scoop, so they all turned out the same size and nice presentation. It was gone quite fast, I didn't even have a chance to take a picture.

Way too sweet, though I added plenty of paprika! Also, it must have been the oats, but was very squishy.I had too many left over from a party-noone went near them!

I do not eat beef but the rest of my family does and typically when I make meatballs my youngest will not eat them, he loved them along with the rest of the family!  I might make the sauce to slow cook pork loin in to see how it turns out.

I love that these meatballs are baked! It's easier and less messy. I only used about 1/4 c. of brown sugar in the sauce, about 1 tsp. of liquid smoke flavoring in the sauce, and only about 1 tsp. of chile powder in the meatball mixture. Thank you Teresa!

These meatballs are a hit in my family. I get requests to make them every holiday. I leave the recipe as is but instead i mince the onions because i don't like the texture when they are chopped. The sauce is amazing, and the liquid smoke is essential. It's a little strong but i've tried cutting it down and it dosen't have the same flavor that way. This meatball recipe will stay in my family and i won't try any other.

These were awesome, I gave them 4 stars instead of five only because I made several changes to suit our taste buds.
I used old-fashioned oats instead of instant--it was fine. I used regular milk instead of evaporated. I doubled the garlic powder--really good flavor. 
For the sauce I followed others' suggestions and used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar...it was still plenty sweet, without being overpowering. I also doubled the garlic in the sauce, and added enough hot sauce to give it a nice zip. I used some that came from mexico...probably any brand would be good. 
These weren't just super saucy, so id you do like a lot of sauce I would double it, but I thought it really was enough as is. I was running short on time so I baked them at 375 for about 45 minutes...they were perfect. Delicious recipe...my husband loved them.

Best meatballs I've ever had by far!  I love how the BBQ sauce is sweet and spicy at the same time.  I like to use cayenne pepper instead of the chilli powder and it adds a really nice kick without being too overpowering.  It makes the contrast between sweet and spicy more noticeable.  My husband and I love it.  He wanted me to use habanero powder but I had to draw the line somewhere!

I made roughly 1/3 of this recipe for the meatballs, but made the full amount of sauce.  I used regular milk rather than the evaporated milk, and I drastically reduced the amount of brown sugar in the sauce, using only about 2 T.  I had red, yellow, orange and green bell peppers that needed to be used up, so I sautéed them for about 5 minutes and tossed them in with the meatballs.  These were good served over jasmine rice, but I didn’t care for the liquid smoke.  I guess I’m just not a fan.  I would make these again but I would omit or reduce the liquid smoke.

Not a big meatball fan but these were good!  I had some ground venison unthawed so subtituted that for beef.  I used 2% milk rather than evaporated. But everything else I followed.  The sauce .... I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar and I thought it was perfect.  DON"T SKIP the chilli powder, it makes the meatball!

I absolutely love this recipe! I have made these several times following the recipe exactly and also making a few changes if I didn't have everything on hand. I have used bread crumbs to replace the oats and my favorite barbecue sauce when I was in a hurry. Enjoy!

These were great meatballs! I will def use this recipe again. I used my own homemade bbq sauce, as I still had a jar left. I will try this bbq sauce next time!

This was fantastic! I added a little bit of crushed pineapple and made extra sauce for serving. My family loved it. I took the advice from another user and made garlic potatoes with shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top and green beans.

This recipe was great! Everyone loved it. I made a few changes based on what I had in the house. I didn't use any evaporated milk, but I did use a little 2% and it still turned out great! Will def. make again.

My husband and kids said this was a keeper!  I used lowfat buttermilk instead of evap milk and used low carb ketchup and splenda brown sugar blend in the sauce.  I also used lean ground beef.  With these changes, a very healthy meal!

I agree with others that the sauce really does have to be doubled. Aside from that, these meatballs were good (everyone I made them for loved them), but they lacked that special kick I was looking for. AND they were very greasy. I think using premade, frozen meatballs might fix that.

These meatballs are excellent!  They were devoured at a Christmas gathering. I made these exactly by the recipe but the next time around, I will cut down the brown sugar to 3/4c or so and I will bake them without the sauce as the sauce burned the first batch.  For the remaining meatballs (walnut-sized), I baked them about 25 minutes the day before.  The day of the event, I put them in the crockpot on low, tossed them with the sauce and let them heat up for an hour or so.  Yum! Yum!

Overall this meal is OK.  It's not  THE dish, it is A dish. 

I gave just 3 stars for 2 reasons: 

1. amount of sugar was overwhelming. Seriously, barbecue taste considers hickory, a little sweet and sourly-tomato taste. It should not be as sweet as desert. 
2. The amount of time & effort for this dish is not proportionate for it's result. I can get the same kind of barbecue meatballs with pre-made smoked barbecue sauce plus chopped onion. 

Now, what I like about this dish and why I gave any stars:

1. I like the idea of baked meatballs (less fat) covered with tasty sauce.
2. I like oatmeal in the ground meat instead of banal bread crumbs.

I have never made homemade meatballs before and came across this recipe.  Made for dinner last night and my family loved them.  The hour cook time was too long as some of them burned - I cut off the burned part and they were still eaten. I cut the sugar and liquid smoke in half as others suggested and they came out great.  I will make this again but reduce the cook time.

These were really tasty!  I didn't have evaporated milk, so just used regular, which I think affected the consistency, but they were still really good. The leftovers were even better the next day.  Next time I will make sure to use evaporated milk though b/c I think it will make them even better.

These were great....i've never heard of evaporated milk in meatballs but you learn something everyday eh?! The milk made the meatballs moist and rich. I made my own sauce for this instead of using this sauce recipe. I added my homemade chili powder(you must try making your own....what a difference!) The kids loved them and the dogs were begging extra hard.

Thankyou so much for a delicious and easy meatball recipe.  Although this recipe does not feed 12.  Also, coming from Australia, I have never heard of liquid smoke, so I used BBQ and tomato sauce together instead.  Worked just fine and my family loved them.  Will be a regular.

It was okay.  Hubby and I ate them, but the kids didn't like them at all.  The glaze/sauce was good but I should have doubled it, I think.  I don't think I'll made this recipe again.

These were really good! The BBQ sauce was really simple but delicious! I did everything separate- Meatballs in the oven and simmered the sauce on the stove.  Served with some fried pickles and was a great little dinner!

These meatballs are AMAZING! I've made these many times now. My husband loves them, my mom and dad gave them a 10 out of 10. So easy - we use a different bottled BBQ sauce every time. And they reheat very well. DELICIOUS!

Made this minus the onion for my family and everyone absolutely loved them. They asked that i make them at least one a week. They are very moist and yet they still hold together very well.

Tried these tonight for supper, over white rice. The only thing I tweaked with this recipe was using 1/2 cup brown sugar in the sauce. The meatballs were GREAT!! They might just be my new fav! The sauce... Well it was different, not sure if I'll use it again. The meatballs are a must though, and would be great with your own favorite sauce. Thanks for sharing!! :)

Simple and simply delicious!  I didn't have evaporated milk but regular milk worked just fine.  I cooked my meatballs in a frying pan until mostly done, then put all in a crock pot with the sauce on low for about 5 hours.  Took to a party and didn't bring home any leftovers.

This was pretty good. My husband and son loved it, I thought is was good, but my teenage daughter didn't like it. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used regular 1% milk and it turned out fine.

Excellent recipe.  The meatballs are perfect- tender and flavorful, and the sauce is delicious, too! They are great for a main course or to just make and keep in the fridge as snacks. (They were just as good as leftovers).    I'm planning to keep this meatball recipe on hand for potluck parties.  Oh, and I liked the meatballs so much that I'll probably try them with different sauces, too :)

i have made these twice and both time have turned out wonderful. The second time i even made them the night before and put them in the fridge until i cooked them the following day. It doesnt specify what size of cooking dish to put them in but i find that a 8x8 doesnt hold them all so use a 9x13

Truly amazing meatballs!! We have a dairy allergy in the family so substituted almond milk which was fine (can't taste it anyway); next time I may double the sauce (or at least 1 1/2 it) as I like to dip or put it over rice for serving. SO YUMMY!!!

These are soooooo good. This was the first time I ever made meatballs. I always just threw the mix in a casserole and made meat loaf. My son would now rather have meat ball. Thanks!!!

I enjoyed these meatballs quite a bit.  I used 1% milk in place of the evaporated milk and cut the sugar in the BBQ sauce down to 1/3 cup.  I'd definitely recommend doubling the BBQ sauce as the amount called for in the recipe doesn't even cover each meatball.  I served these with the garlic basil mashed potatoes (from this website).

These were great!  Excellant glaze...I used less brown sugar in the glaze and dry bread crumbs in place of the oats in the meat balls (just a personal preference).  Served with a whole grain rice and Ceaser salad.

Very good.  Subbed Worcestershire for the liquid smoke and used ground turkey but kept everything else the same.  BF even liked it and its hard to get him to eat turkey!

Have used this recipe for years. The one I have is twice the ingredients for the meatballs. The sauce is 1 24oz bottle of ketchup, 11/2 c. brown sugar, 1 tbsp liquid smoke, 3/4 c chopped onion, and 3/4 tsp garlic powder.  Makes plenty of sauce.  They freeze really well.  Last time I put them individually on a cookie sheet to freeze and then put them in a ziptop bag.  I think it worked, when my son came home, he took the bag full home with him.  He said they had plenty of sauce on the meatballs.

They're wonderful! My favorite thing about them is their versatility. You can use them as an appetizer, meatballs for spaghetti, or my favorite, meatball subs (just buy hot dog buns, put three meatballs on it, melt some cheese on top or add Parmesan). I didn't think they were too sweet, possibly if your main goal is a meatball for pasta, but otherwise, I loved the sauce.

The meatball recipe was fantastic! (Never thought about using oatmeal.) Because I was afraid the sauce would be too sweet as others have noted, I did not use the one in the recipe but used our favorite barbecue sauce. Only thing is that the sauce turned out a bit too thick so I'm going to thin out the barbecue sauce next time. Served it with macaroni and cheese with some veggies and it was great! What leftovers we had, we made meatball sandwiches the next day for lunch. Thanks for the recipe.

I read the other reviews and I halved the sauce--I quarted the brown sugar to just under 1/4 cup.  I didn't have liquid smoke so I omitted it.  I used meatballs I had already made (frozen then defrosted).

I was so excited for these, and then I was so disappointed! I used 2.25 lbs. of ground beef, and I adjusted the recipe to fit that amount. When I was mixing the ingredients, I noticed the first problem. After I added the evaporated milk (10 oz. I think) the meat mixture was VERY moist. It was so moist that when I formed the balls, I did not think they were going to keep their shape when I began cooking. I believe this recipe should say to add the milk until the mixture is slightly moist, which may or may not require all of the milk. It definitely would not for me! Well, I decided to keep going with the recipe since I used so much meat and did not want to waste any. So then, per one reviewer, I decided to put the meatballs in the crockpot. The reviewer mixed some water with the sauce, and I did the same. BAD IDEA. The already VERY moist meatballs were now soaking in watery sauce! Next, after having my roommates turn off the crockpot for a time, I decided to just forget the crockpot and put the meatballs in the oven. I think this is what salvaged them, at least a little. I poured off the liquid and put them in there for about 40 minutes or so. When I tasted the meatballs, the ones that didn't turn to mush, they were very very moist, too moist, but I now know how to fix that. Also, despite the water, the sauce was really sweet(I even halved it!)! I might try this recipe again when I want some meatballs, but I will not use the sauce again.

I used fresh minced garlic in the meatballs and added a little worchestershire. I formed the meatballs with my small cookie scoop to make uniform meatballs baked them in the oven most of the way. I then used a slotted spoon to take them out of the pan and transferred them to the crockpot. With the sauce, I doubled it (we like a saucier), added a little worchestershire sauce and used dark brown sugar for a deeper sweetness. I'm cooking it in the crockpot for a couple hours to save on heat costs. I'll update on how we liked it after supper. I plan on serving it with Rice Casserole, also from this site. EDITED SEVERAL DAYS LATER: Good taste. If I were to make this again, I'd cut back on the liquid just a bit for a firmer meatball. I'd also use cracker crumbs instead of oats. The next day, the oats tasted odd and gave a different texture than the day before. I've never had that issue with meatballs I'd made with ritz cracker crumbs. I think I'd add a little sage, too. Otherwise, very good. My older son kept complimenting me on a good hamburger.

I've been making this recipe for many years and thought it was my family's secret recipe! Imagine my surprise seeing the same recipe online. We always serve it with cheesy potato casserole. Line your pan with foil for an easy clean-up. I normally use skim milk instead of evaporated milk because that's usually what I have on hand. Great recipe to serve to company.

This was great!  I made smaller (~1") meatballs and cut down the cooking time.  The next time, the only thing I would do differently is chop the onions a little finer.

These are excellent. I do not care for the flavor of liquid smoke so I leave that out. Also I just use regular milk and dried minced onion. I throw these in the crockpot for three hours on high or six on low.

Very yummy!  I made them for dinner, paired with brown rice and asparagus, and got many praises.  I altered the recipe a bit, by using ground turkey and added fresh basil.  
What I didn't like was the quick cooking oats.  Next time I will use bread for the consistency.  The cooking oats caused them to be a little mushy inside.

Absolutely delicious! It smelled GREAT from the moment I put it in the oven. I mixed ground turkey with ground beef- and they came out fantastic. Oh, and I eliminated the evaporated milk. Nice and juicy. A real treat. I don't usually like meatballs, but these are a new favorite! My husband thought they were sensational! Will definitely make again.

This was delicious and a big hit. We will definitely be making this again.

It was a bit too sweet. Next time I think I will leave a bit of the sugar out of the sauce and add some vinegar. It came out like candy- delicious but very rich.

This is good.  I used ground turkey and bread crumbs instead of the beef and oatmeal. (Ground chicken works well too.) like cooking with a caribbean flavor, so I made a few changes. I only used about 4 or so tablespoons of sugar, and added a tablespoon of ginger and a tablespoon of rum for kick.  Simmer all and the liquor burns off.  Very good!

These were SO good! I skipped the sauce because I didn't have the liquid smoke in the house and substituted with some mesquite bbq sauce I had in the house.  They turned out yummy.  I froze the leftover ones on a cookie sheet and then once they were frozen stuck them in a ziplock bag so we now have several more meals in the house :)

This is a great comfort food dish. Served with some mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus.  I did add a small palmful of montreal steak seasoning because I was out of chili powder. 
Also, to get nice even meatballs, use a medium size cookie/ice cream scoop, then roll them into a ball.

These were very good and very simple to make.  I made them as one of my many appetizers for our Super bowl party last Sunday and people ate them, but did not make any comments.  These meatballs were the only thing left over.  Next time I plan on serving them with Spaghetti.

I have never rated a recipe from the internet before but this recipe was SOOO GOOD!  It was pretty easy and everyone loved it!  I did use only 1/2 Cup brown suger and worsashire/soy sauce instead of liquid smoke (1-1/2 tblsp. soy and about 3 slashes of worsteshire). I added an extra half cup of ketchup. Also, I cooked for only 45 min.

These are a great way of using plain old burger and turning it into something fantastic.  I didn't have evaporated milk so I just used regular milk and they turned out great, my 4 year old just loves them she couldn't wait for them to be done!!!!

These were ok...I followed the recipe exactly except for the liquid smoke flavour..I reduced it and IMHO it would be WAY too smokey if you added the full amount.  The only gripe I have with this recipe is that it in no way, serves 12 people.  If you made 1.5" meatballs as the recipe states, you'd end up with about one and a half meatballs per person....so the nutritional information is really skewed.  This recipe serves 6 people, not 12.

I added way more garlic powder and finely chopped onion. I wish I had used less milk - the mixture was a little bit too sloppy, and I had to add more oatmeal. I also cut back on the sugar in the bbq sauce, and thought it was still a tad too sweet. Husband, however, thopught it was perfect. We had it over spagetti with a sprinking of cheese on top. Not bad. Thanks!

My family really liked these meatballs.  When I made them I only added 1/2 the chili powdered it asked for (I still thought was a little strong) but my family really liked them.  We had a few left over and they were still good and actually the chili powder mellowed out a bit.

I come from a small western Kansas town, my family calls this recipe, "Funeral Meatballs". (When someone in town dies. the towns women get together and decide who's bringing what dish to the grieving family. This always shows  up).  I have added left over rice and or bell pepper to the meatball recipe.  I double the reciepe,  and freeze half. Our reciepe cuts the brown sugar in half. One of my all time favorite reciepes. Love this!

I felt compelled to leave a review about these meatballs because I just finished one that was a day old and it had me emotional. I have never made meatballs in my life. I am not a meatball fanatic. I just wanted to offer my two-year-old something different to eat. Stumbled across this recipe and decided to give it a shot. I amped up my seasonings to almost twice the amount in the meat due to other reviewers complaining of bland taste. Made the sauce exactly to the specifications. They were pretty good straight out of the oven but a day later on top of a fresh-baked yeast roll I was in heaven. The sauce could have been about 1/4 more to get an even spread but I just tossed the balls when they came out of the oven and it covered pretty good because it thins when it cooks. I might make this again on Sunday because it was so amazing. But keep in mind the meatballs didn't get mine blowing until the next day. They were even really good cold. Love, love , love.

Excellent recipe. I did not change a thing. Followed the recipe exactly. I have actually baked the meatballs without the BBQ sauce and froze them for later in the week.  Then I make the sauce and pour over frozen meatballs in a pot and cook stove top. They were delish and still moist.  Great plan if you need to do 30 minute meals during the work week. This will be in regular rotation at my house

I altered the recipe and used sweet italian sausage. The sauce was a bit like general tso..sticky..but tasty.  I might put less sugar in and I like the mustard idea..could use something to cut the sugary-ness.

These were on the sweet side but overall very delicious! Next time I will cut back on the brown sugar. Also I didn't have oatmeal so I substituted crushed cornflake crumbs and they worked as a great binder.

I did change the cooking method just a bit in this.  First of all I cut the brown sugar in half.  I baked the meatballs on there own, for about 20 minutes to get rid of some of the grease.  Didn't want a greasy sauce.  In a sauce pan I sauteed the onion and garlic to soften then added the rest of the sauce ingredients and heated until hot.  Put the meatballs into a baking dish and poured the sauce over and baked another 10 minutes.  I think an hour is WAY too long to cook meatballs.  I gave this a 4 because I think the sauce would have been greasy, and that this would have been WAY too sweet had I used all the brown sugar.

This recipe was very easy to adapt to my gluten free needs. Also, these were very easy to prepare and throw in the oven while doing other things. My only complaint was that they were slightly greasy, which could have been taken care of by baking on a broiler pan for about half the time then baking for the rest of the time in the sauce. Either way a very good recipe to use as a jumping off point.

These are very good! Like many, I made a couple of adjustments to fit my taste. Instead of making the sauce, I added "Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce (enough to coat in crock pot), 1/4 cup of Grape Jelly, and 2 Tbsp. of Brown Sugar. I also added Soy Sauce in place of salt to the meat mixture. They are Yummy--A sweet & sour coating! :)

My family loved these! I made half with BBQ sauce and half with Teriyaki sauce. We added extra sauce because it was so good. This will definitely be a keeper for game nights! Thanks for sharing!

AMAZING MEATBALLS!!!  I did not use the sauce as shown in the recipe (I've got a cold, I was too lazy to mix it up) but instead I poured a bottle of PC Honey Garlic BBQ Sauce over the meatballs before baking.  Wow.  How can something so simple be so darned good?  The meatballs held together nicely, had a hearty texture AND were very flavorful.  (I usually hate the taste of meat, no matter how it's prepared, but eat it for the health benefits...it's not often I go back for seconds!)  This is going into my recipe book--it's a keeper!  I am glad we have leftovers--and even a few to freeze for another lazy night!!  (Next time I'm going to use a sweet and sour sauce and I'll add a can of pineapple tidbits, a sliced red and green pepper and a sliced onion before baking...yummmmm.)  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is fantastic, you can make meatloaf with the same sauce and its delicious. I use sea-salt instead of regular salt though :)

These turned out great.  Even days later we are eating them and they are even yummier.  For the party, I doubled the sauce and put the meatballs in a crockpot with the sauce.  The guests had so many compliments on these.  Very good.

Meatballs were good, but I'd prefer to brown them in a skillet for more flavor and color.  To me, the sauce was missing something and too sweet.  Made for New Years Eve and nobody liked them.  Will find a different sauce recipe.

Used this meatball recipe for one of my catering events - excellent!  Loved the flavor boost that the chili powder gave it.  I did not make the sauce.  I used our own bbq sauce recipe so I cannot comment on that.

I made these without the BBQ sauce.  Wanted something to freeze for a quick meal.  My whole house smelled amazing while they baked, and I couldn't stop eating them while they cooled (even when they were so hot they burned my mouth!).  The chili powder adds a very subtle little after kick to them, which I loved!  I did use another person's suggestion of dried bread crumbs vs ripped up bread.  I think I put in around 3/4 of crumbs.  I would definitely recommend these.  Hoping they taste as good after being frozen!

Great meatball Recipe. Definitely a keeper for me. I used a chili sauce instead of ketchup and it added depth for me in the sauce. YUMMY!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  The taste is so unique that it easy to tell the sauce is homemade.  Our family really enjoyed this one!  Never tasted a meatball like it!

I made this recipe exactly as it stated, and it was wonderful and easy!  Big hit with the guys in my family and they much prefer it over meatloaf now. The sauce really makes the meatballs, so next time I am going to double the sauce to have for leftovers.

Very good.  I'm not usually a BBQ meatball fan but these were very good, and pretty easy.  I cut the sugar in half, as others recommended.  I also mixed 1 lb beed with 1/2 lb sausage to give the meat flavor a little more depth.

These were AMAZING!!!! I was completely shocked by the flavor and texture of this dish. I even had some problems with my oven the night that I made these...a few of them burnt on the bottom...but they still tasted AWE-some!! (We just didn't eat the bottom part on the ones that got burnt.) I would definately not omit or substitute the liquid smoke...it contributes much to the overall flavor and this dish wouldn't be the same without it. I will make these often!!!

Great.  I made exactly as is (half the brown sugar in the glaze), and served with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes.  The next day we made sub sandwiches with the leftovers.  I liked the texture of the meatball.

Fantastic!!! I have a different recipe I used for the meatballs, however I did make the sauce.  The sauce was excellent!!! Some reviewers commented on it being too sweet---I thought it was perfect.  I didn't make any changes to the sauce recipe.  It smelled delicious while baking!

Scaled the recipe to accommadate 18 servings, and served these as main course for a bit of a non-traditional easter meal.  Not only were they fun to eat, they were delicious and went nicely with coleslaw, pasta salad and deviled eggs.  Everyone loved them.

My family really enjoyed these!  Very tasty.  I used lean ground beef, and made them very large.  Next time I think I would use a little less oatmeal.  I tend to like less filler.  Un-like some of the other suggestions, I would keep the sauce the same.  This was great served over Pennsylvania Dutch noodles and my son loved the leftovers in a sandwich!

This was great! I was a little worried about the consistency pre-baking, since I scaled the recipie to 16 servings (who buys meat by the half pound?) I used two 5 oz cans of evaporated milk (1 extra ounze) and 2 eggs but they came out delicous!  I had some fresh parsley laying around so I chopped and added that, and one piece of old bread (crumbed) that I found in the back of the fridge, and about a tsp of cayanne.  The sauce I used the unscaled quantities subed onoun flakes and garlic powder for the real stuff and squeezed half a lemon into the sauce for some ZING! It was plenty and plenty delicious!

I want to serve these as an appetizer at a dinner I’m hosting next week so I made them today as a test.  They passed the test and are possibly the best meatballs I’ve ever had.  Can’t wait to serve them to my guest.

Oh wow!! Seriously amazing. The first time around we didn't have ketchup and had to use bbq sauce. It was amazing! The second time we made the sauce and it was even better - we didn't use chili powder to keep it kid friendly but other than that stuck to the recipe. So amazingly yummy and a keeper in our house. We put the meatballs on subs and served with cheese on it. The only meatball recipe we will ever need.

Yum!  These are so easy and really good.  I didn't want a ton of grease in the finished product so I cooked the meatballs without the sauce for about 30 minutes or till most of the grease had cooked out and then pulled it out of the oven and drained off the grease.  At this point I poured the sauce over and continued cooking another 20-30 minutes or till cooked through.  Some important notes about the sauce.  I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 2 Tbsp. and it was plenty sweet.  A little liquid smoke goes a long way so be careful with how much you use.  I wouldn't use more than 1/2 tsp. at the most for this amount of sauce.  It's good with a little worcestershire (about 1 tsp.) added in.  Served with mashed potatoes.  I will make this again for sure.

Loved the meatballs! Loved the sauce! Only sauted my onions before I added to meat mixture, doubled the salt/pepper,and used crushed garlic. Baked the hour at 350 on cookie sheet, without the sauce. Sauted onion again for sauce, mixing in  remaining ingredients with only 3/4 c. brown sugar and only 2tsp. liq. smoke and 1 tsp. dry mustard. Last 20 minutes, transferred meatballs to baking dish, and poured on sauce.Made about 11 good sized meatballs. Served with Green Onion Mashed potatoes and Corn. Big Hit! Thank you for a Great recipe.

This sauce is fantastic!  I was going to make the meatballs too, but ran out of time and had to use frozen ones instead, but I imagine that the real ones would make this only get better.  I also used worchestershire sauce instead of smoke flavoring.  No need to look any further for a meatball recipe!  A definite crowd pleaser.

The meat balls were great but the sauce was too sweet. I would suggest buying a spicy BBQ sauce and adding the liquid smoke and using that as the sauce. Other than that the meatballs were moist!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe.  My first time making meatballs and they turned out fabulous.  
The only thing I did differently is that I through them in the Crock Pot, like some other foodies have done.  And I added about a cup and a half of water to the sauce.  Turned out wonderful!  Not too sweet at all.  My daughter who really doesn't like anything BBQ, loved them.  She had hers on a hoagie bun.  My 4, and 8 year old boys also loved them as well as my husband. This will become a regular in our house!
Just Yummy!
**Had to come back and edit.  I did double the recipe on both the meatballs and the sauce.  (We are a family of 6) And I only used about 4 oz. of Evap. Milk.

I loved these meatballs but my family thought they were too sweet and felt you could taste the liquid smoke. I have made them several times and added less of the liquid smoke which seems to go over much better with my family.

it was an easy and tasty recipe. i didn't have the liquid smoking flavouring so instead i used soya sauce and it came out just as good. maybe next time i would dilute the glazing sauce with water since it dried out completely.

I looked and looked for a good meatball recipe and finally settled on this one and I'm glad I did! Next time I'll make more sauce for our rice. This is great made with 93/7 lean ground turkey and placed on brown rice! My husband and our 2 and 4 year old boys LOVED this! Thank you for a great supper.

I have made meatballs similar to this before. This time I was out of liquid smoke.I checked out the reviews on this recipe.... some had used bbq sauce, so I decided to try it. For the sauce, I used KC Masterpiece, chopped onion, 2 T brown sugar and garlic powder. The meatballs turned out very well. For times when I'm out of the sauce ingredients, I'll definitely make it this way again. --I cooked the meatballs 45 minutes before adding the sauce. After adding the sauce, I cooked an additional 15 minutes...they turned out perfect!

These are very!! good.  I think they are better as an appetizer or good for a potluck since they are a little sweet and you can only eat so many of them before its to sweet.  But they are great!!!

Tasty, but I had a problem with the recipe.

I only baked them for 50 minutes, and the sauce burned in the pan on the lower rack.  The upper pan was less saucy than gloppy.  If I make these again, I'll cook the meatballs alone for maybe 30 minutes, then put them in a crockpot with the sauce and let them finish that way.

Very good sauce.  I actually used  pre-made frozen meatballs and threw them in a crockpot with the ingredients for the sauce.  I let them cook overnight and brought them into work for a party.  I served them with homemade herb and onion rolls.  I received many compliments!

I didn't add the evap milk for lower calories or the chili pepper so it wouldn't be spicy for my kids and it was wonderful.  Our family would definitely make this again and again.

Great! My kids loves these meatballs.
I make these with baked potatoe wedges.Which you can bake right along with these to finish the meal off and only have to have the oven going.

I followed some of the other advice and cut back to 3/4c brown sugar and instead of adding liquid smoke I added a couple of dashes of worchestire sauce and 1 tbs soya sauce. Turned out great.

These were by far the BEST meatballs we have ever had!  I cooked them most of the way in the oven and then transferred them to a crock pot to finish cooking and keep warm at a party.  My sons are BEGGING me to make them again at home! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe for meatballs!! The sauce is superb and compliments the meatballs wonderfully.  I would recommend using ground sirloin or a leaner meat though, as the fat/grease in the ground beef can overwhelm the sauce somewhat. It is definately going to be a frequently used recipe in my house though!

I made this recipe last night and it was great!  I did use 1/2 the sugar as other people suggested and it was still plenty sweet.  I eliminated the chili pepper because I don't like too much spice and also didn't use the liquid smoke because I didn't have any and it still tasted great.  I used about 1/2 the recommended milk and used skim instead.  

Served with mashed potatoes and peas and hubby and my 2 1/2 yr old loved them.  Will definitely be adding to my regular menu.  Very easy and delicious.

I was pleased with how these came out.  In my small, apartment sized oven, the meatballs cooked through in about 45 mins.  Next time, I would shred the onion as opposed to dicing, as I did not care for the onion pieces in the meatballs.  I enjoyed the glaze, adding 1 tbsp worcestshire sauce, and 1/2 cup chili sauce to counterbalance my brown sugar.

I made some modifications due to food allergies and they still came out great. 1 TBSP of chili powder is powerful and spicey. My husband and i loved it but the kids were not too keen on it. This DOES NOT make 12 servings - no way! As others have said you will probably want to double the sauce. I also was forced to modify the sauce, the recipe simply calls for too much sugar (I used aprox 1/2 c because i do like a sweeter sauce, 1 C would have been WAY to sweet) and it also calls for too much liquid smoke so beware on that count too.

Great meatballs!  I tried this recipe and was very happy with the results.  I took the meatballs to a party and all who commented thought the meatballs were great.  I decided to use only half of the brown sugar called for since some other reviewers commented on the sweetness of the sauce.  Personally, I do think it wise to cut back on the brown sugar because the sauce was perfect using half of the recommended amount.

These were super simple to make and very tasty! They were very wet and hard to work with and I thought they might need more oats as someone else suggested, but I left the recipe alone and they turned out perfect. I served this with mashed potatoes which was perfect for using up the rest of the can of milk. Could be done in the crock pot too, I suppose.

I liked these, but the rest of the family did not. I made it as a meal with noodles.  These would really be great made smaller for an appetizer.   I put about 3/4 the amount of sugar listed.  If I make it again I will use 1/2 the amount listed.  I will also use less milk.

I cannot compliment this dish enough. mind blowingly good flavor. I did 1/2 the brown sugar as many suggested which i thought was great. still sweet but not overpowering. I was shocked at how good the sauce was with so few ingredients - bravo! Immediately adding this to my personal recipe book cause its soo good! best meatballs ever had!

I am rating just the meatballs; I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce with these (hickory and brown sugar). The meatballs are amazing! I went easy on the pepper and severly cut the chili powder because my kids think ketchup is spicy.
I made a double batch and am glad I did! All 6 adults who had these loved them, the kids who tried them did eat them. (One said the SBR sauce was spicy.) I am saving/printing this recipe to make over and over again.

Delish! Perfect fresh or with the the meat for the meatballs premade and frozen but not shaped. I followed the recipe for both the meatballs and the sauce for the serving size of 8. Only thing I changed the first time was only mixed 3 tbs onions in the 1lb ground beef and used traditional oats. Second time still only used 3tbs onion in 1 lb meat and traditional oats but for the sauce prepared from serving size 12 instead of 8. Cut sugar cut ketchup. Used 1tb liquid smoke instead of 2 tsp. Used 1/4 cup onions instead of 3tbs that I used with serving size 8 sauce. Second sauce tasted less sweet and more like meatloaf. First sauce made from serving size 8 was more like sweet bbq. Enjoyed them both. Greased round pan with butter. Meatballs are even more tender if frozen before cooking so I make them and store them and I don't pat them out until time to cook. Used 1  whole egg for serving size 8. Used 1.5 eggs for serving size 12.

I made this a few times. The first time I followed the recipe to the dot. Way too sweet. The next few times I add some carrots and feta cheese to increase the volume. The sauce I change to tomato and onion (canned tomatoes and onions that I mashed) sauce mixed with bbq basting sauce. Add some worcester sauce and garlic (can one ever add too much garlic).  Came out perfect. Not even next morning leftovers left. One for the keeper.

These meatballs are delicious!!!!  Not very healthy but worth it, and very easy to make. Made about 20 meatballs at 1.5 inches round each. Paired with rice and veggies they make a great meal.

I didn't the first time but next time I will cut down on the brown sugar and the liquid smoke.   Also we like it with pilaf so I will double the sauce for more gravy.   I use extra lean ground beef in meatballs.  Not super fast and easy it's more from scratch.  But I had the time and made it. You can also add rice for porcupines.

This was delicious!!  I made a couple of changes.  First, I made the mistake and put the Liquid smoke  in the meat.  BUT - we decided that was better than in the sauce.  Also , I agree with some of the other reviewers, 1 cup of brown sugar is too much- I used between 1/4 and 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet. Definitely will make again!!

I made it almost as per recipe (but as recommended by another cook) made double quantity of sauce. Had to make it minus the liquid smoke flavouring, couldn't find any. It was yummy, will be an addition to my regular cook up.

This is VERY similar to a recipe been using for close to 20 years that came from Taste of Home. As another reviewer mentioned, used crushed saltines instead of oatmeal. Big difference is meatballs designed to be frozen raw. Spray the cookie sheet with Pam, freeze and place into ziplocks for use when you are ready. It is a wet mixture-freezing makes it stay together  through the baking. Make yearly for family reunion. Very popular. Make meatballs weeks in advance, that morning throw in roaster , careful not to stack too high as will not support weight of thawing meatballs without smooshing bottom layer.  Cover in the ketchup mixture. Keep warm in slow cooker.  Taste better the next day!

Except for substituting Worcestershire Sauce for the liquid smoke and using 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of a cup, I made this recipe exactly as is for a potluck and it was very good.  Only 4 meatballs left over at the potluck.  Next time I may try tweaking it a little by doubling the garlic powder and minced garlic, use only 1/2 cup brown sugar and double the sauce recipe and see how it tastes.

My family loved this recipe. Instead of ground beef I used ground turkey mixed with mild Italian sausage. I didn't double the sauce like some did and it was still a lot of sauce. great recipe

I've made this several times now. I agree as written - too sweet. We have decided it is best with 1/2 to slightly less than 1/2 of the brown sugar. I didn't have the sweet milk on hand, so I used regular, and tossed in 2 TBSP dry milk too as my substitute, as well as Worcester Sauce in place of the smoke. Rave reviews, and people are asking for the recipe!

Wonderful!! A tad on the sweet side for me so next time I will cut down the amount of brown sugar since I made then to be eaten solo with toothpicks.  If you are using them with bread as sliders, the recipe is perfect.

Yum! Is all I can say! I sub 2% milk for the evap and used quinoa rather than oats. We throw them on a Hawaiian sweet bun with some mozzarella cheese. They make a perfect appetizer! It is a must have for your next appetizer party!

This was a big hit! My very picky husband loved these as well as the guest at the party I attended. I ran out of Ketchup, so I substituted Cocktail sauce and the result was amazing. I also made a double recipe of the sauce. I would definitely recommend them.

These were awesome meatballs and I loved the stickyness of the sauce.  I made as directed with one exception...I used A-1 sauce instead of liquid smoke.  I wanted liquid smoke, just didn't have it in the pantry.  The flavor was still amazing.  I may just keep the recipe w/the A-1.  We have enough to try as sandwiches tomorrow - YAY!

This is a marvelous meatball recipe as written. The meatballs really soak up the sauce and flavor. The meatballs are great alone, as well, and you can try them with spaghetti sauce, the traditional cocktail/grape jelly sauce, etc. Marvelous!

I made these almost exactly as stated, with a few minor changes because it's what I had on hand.  I added 1/2 lb ground turkey because I only had 1 lb ground beef.  I also subbed half and half for the evap and old-fashioned oats for quick cooking.  Otherwise, I cooked these exactly as stated.  They were fabulous!  Not one meatball was left after the party was over and I will be making these over and over.  I loved making my own sauce as well.  Made it extra special!

Great recipe, simple and easy to make your own. Like many others the meatball were very hard to form but in the end came out moist and tasty. I changed the recipe to yield 6 servings and that produced 22-24 meatballs. Also, I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of the oats, omitted the liquid smoke, and added a cup of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce to add  smokey flavor.

Delicious! I brought these to a party and received many compliments. I put a good spoonful of the sauce over each meatball and it made a nice glaze. Smelled fantastic while baking. The glaze is a bit sweet but that's probably why this is called a glaze and not a sauce. Very easy to make.

Made a few changes, used milk and cooked burger patties on my stove grill slathered in sauce. For the sauce I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, didn't have liquid smoke so I substituted Worcestershire.  Delicious.  Loved by all.

I have made these meatballs twice in two weeks!... as requested by my boyfriend.  They are de-lish! I followed the recipe almost exactly, I used skim milk instead of evaporated milk, and only used 4 ounces. Also, I didn't have any liquid smoke, so instead I added 2 tablespoons of "smokey" BBQ sauce,(Sweet Baby Ray's Gourmet BBQ Sauce), to the ketchup mixture.  The meatballs are perfect, not to soft where you can't touch 'em or they'll fall apart, and not dried out... a little bit of texture and  the flavor of the meatballs is a great match for the sticky, tangy, sweet BBQ sauce!  I found my go-to meatball recipe for appetizers or as a main dish served with veggies and/or rice and/or potatoes. Thanks for sharing!

This is a favorite among my entire family!  I made it with oats the first time and wasn't a huge fan.  I subsituted panko bread crumbs in place of the oats and it was fantastic.  The sauce is tasty and we love it served over mashed potatoes.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe! I've made it soooo many times now and it still comes out perfect! My whole family loves these (including my picky kids)! My husband is a home-made freak who has to have everything home-made and absolutely LOVES them! NOTHING is wrong with this recipe AT ALL! Every single thing is PERFECT! I keep seeing people who add this or that to "make it better" but you seriously don't need to add ANYthing! I don't normally write reviews for recipes but this is well deserved! I make them for dinner, church dinners, family get-togethers, anything. I love to make them for little appetizers, too. I just make them a little smaller and stick a tooth pick in them. yuuuuummmmy! Thank you to whoever made this recipe and posted it! :)

THE HIT of my last party.  I doubled the recipe and even used a bit more ground beef than called for, and more onion than called for, too.  Added a bottle of good, store-bought hickory bbq sauce because I wanted to be sure I had enough sauce for my party.  It was totally amazing and I did have enough sauce! I, too, cut the sugar in half and it was PLENTY sweet--will probably use only a 3rd of the required sugar next time. Based on everyone's reactions at the party, I am quite sure that I will be asked to bring these meatballs to future events.

This sauce was to die for.  I doubled all sauce ingredients except brown sugar.  I will never buy prepared bbq sauce again, and I am not much of a bbq sauce fan.  This dish will be in my permanent rotation. Great recipe!

These were pretty good, but nothing special.  Using oats rather than breadcrumbs gave the meatballs a fluffier texture.  I had to make a couple substitutions based on what I had: 2% rather than evaporated milk and worcestershire sauce instead of liquid smoke.  Based on other reviews, I cut back on the sugar, but the sauce was still nothing remarkable, just a typical homemade barbecue sauce.  The meatballs also only took about 45 minutes to cook.  I like that they are baked (never thought of that!); it's easier, cleaner, and maybe a bit healthier.  I'll consider using oats in place of breadcrumbs in the future, and may add liquid smoke to bbq sauce if I ever get ahold of any, but will not use this recipe again.

Very yummy. The man of the house even commented on how good they were. I followed the recipe except for doubling the sauce and halving the sugar. I put half the sauce over the meatballs before they went in the oven, then turned them half way through the cooking time and put on the remainder of the sauce.

Not as popular at my dinner party as noted.  They were good, but not as great as others noted.

This was unbelievable! I loved it, the only change I made was that I substituted the oats for instant rice.

These have become our go-to recipe for potlucks and family dinners.  The only change I've made is to use onion powder in the glaze, but only because it's a personal preference (I'm not a big onion fan anyway). The sauce is fabulous as is - I've never seen a reason to reduce the amount of brown sugar.  Again, probably a personal preference.

These were THE best meatballs I have ever have. I left out the liquid smoke and added Worcestershire sauce instead. AMAZING. My husband had thirds!! Next time I will make them with extra sauce to use for other things! YUM!

I pre-made these in the oven for a pot luck and then stuck them (with extra sauce) in a crock pot to take with me. Everyone loved them. Would have been great just out of the oven, but were also good served out of a crock pot. Very good to put on a roll with a little coleslaw to make a mini-meatball sandwich.

These were really good.  I didn't have quite a pound and a 1/2 of ground beef, so I reduced the other ingredients slightly.  The meatballs were very moist and flavorful.  I also didn't use the glaze, I used Annie's Natural BBQ sauce so it would be gluten-free for my husband.  I just drizzled it over the meatballs before baking.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Good Good Good!!! I made a few changes and it was excellent. 1. Cut the sugar in half!! It is too sweet otherwise. 2. I used 1 1/2 lb elk meat and it turned out great. 3. Made a bit more sauce to completely coat the meatball. Like 1 1/2X as much.

I scaled this down to 1 lb of hamburger and it made about 25 nice size meatballs.  I don't think the scaled down amount of the sauce was enough so next time I'd not scale that part back.  Thanks for posting the recipe!

Hot dang, just finished making these and tried one.  These are great, here's what I did.  I had 1lb of ground turkey so I scaled it to 8 servings.  I made the meatballs with turkey, old fashioned oats, and a splash of 1% milk (everything else the same).  If using turkey, you may want to omit milk, they were really moist and didn't hold shape.  For the sauce, I decreased the brown sugar to half and was still too sweet.  I used worchestershire sauce instead of liquid smoke and doubled it.  The sauce was still way too sweet so I added cider vinegar which made it sweet and tangy.  More to my liking.  They just came out of the oven and are delicious.  I'll be serving these tomorrow at a play date but had to try it before hand.  Will be making again but decrease the sugar more, keep everything else stated above!

This was so delicious!!  The sauce was fantastic.  You really do need to use a larger dish than medium as specified.  My medium dish was full after half the meatballs were made so I made a small meatloaf!  Highly recommend you to try this one.

Wonderful recipe!! I added 2 cups cooked leftover beans (Trader Joe's 17bean mix) which I pulsed in the cuisinart. I also used bbq sauce from the bottle as the glaze. Thanks for posting this recipe -- I would never have thought of chili and oatmeal as ingredients for meatballs.

This was awesome, I took it to a potluck and it was a huge hit.  Loved the sauce too, but took advice from other reviewers and only put in 1/4 c. brown sugar.  It was definitely sweet enough.

Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly for the meatballs, except I added in ground turkey with the ground beef. I used a cheap jar of barbecue sauce for the sauce and it was great. The entire family loved them.

Really great recipe for meatballs-got it right the first time!!!! My husband loved it as well.  You can also prepare the meatballs without the BBQ glaze and use them in a meatball sub with marinara or just in your pasta...excelent!

Good recipe.  Very easy and quick to make, the sauce was sweet but not over the top.  Served the leftovers on an italian roll and sprinkled a little grated parmesan cheese on it.

I thought the meatballs were excellent! They were so moist and tasty. I didn't have liquid smoke on hand so I ended up using bottled BBQ sauce. They still turned out delicious. My 14 and 24 year old sons raved about them, and checked on me to make sure I saved this recipe for future use.

I substituted the from-scratch bbq sauce with Bull's Eye sauce. I also slowly added the evaporated milk and only added in what felt right; I ended up with two extra ounces. Finally, I rolled the meat into bite-sized pieces and browned them before baking.

These were delicious! Yes, you do want a full tablespoon of chili powder (in comparison to the other spice, this quantity had surprised me). A bit ugly with the brown, store-bought bbq sauce (a red sauce might be prettier). Even my friend who hates bbq sauce ate a few without any complaint.

My family love, love, loves this recipe!!  I as well cut down on the brown sugar.  I also bake them most of the way first in the oven without the  sauce on a sloted top roasting pan.  Cuts down on the greese quite a bit.  I then put it in a crockpot with the sauce.  What a hit!!

I made this last night for a church get together, and it was very well received!  I followed the recommendations of others, and cut back on the brown sugar (1/3 to 1/2 cup).  I cut back on the chili powder as well, but I don't think it would have been too spicy had I used the amount listed.  I didn't have liquid smoke, so I followed the recommendation of another person and used a couple dashes of worcestershire sause and ~1tbsp of soy sauce.  Be sure to check the meatballs before 1hr - the sauce will start to burn.

This was a very easy yummy mid week meal.  Like most others, I cut the brown sugar. I prefer a lower carb recipe so I used low carb ketchup (Atkins) which has less sugar, and 1/2 c. Splenda blend brown sugar (I may consider using only a 1/3 c. next time).  I did not have any quick oats on hand so used 1/2 c. cracker meal.  I also used meatlof blend (beef, pork and veal) instead of plain ground beef. My husband and teenage son loved this recipe!

These are awesome meatballs!  The recipe as written is a very sweet bbq sauce.  Add a little less if you'd like them a bit spicier.

I thought this recipe for the meatballs turned out very well, except the bbq sauce started to burn if left cooking for the full hour. I will probably make these again, and just not cook them as long.

My husband and children love these made the same but baked with pasta sauce to go with spaghetti.  I enjoyed the bbq sauce.  Very moist meatballs - easy to make ahead of time and simply pop in the oven!

This was a very good recipe although I will add alot less chili powder. Both my husband and I thought these would be absolutely perfect if I even left out the chili powder next time. Will make again though. Thanks. :)

Wonderful!  I was asked to bring something for a Boy Scout potluck and I decided to increase the recipe to make about a hundred of these.  Rave reviews were heard from everyone.  Now my kids ask me to make them all the time.  Thanks for the wondermous recipe!

These meatballs are the BEST!  We loved the sweet tangy sauce. They make a quick and easy dinner the whole fam likes.  If we have any left over my 17 yr old son and hubby actually fight over who gets them.
