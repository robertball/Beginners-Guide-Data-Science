I made this into a breakfast food by using those fully cooked breakfast sausage links. I did not use the whole package of frozen links, just enough for a full container of whomp biscuits (eight sausage links). I didn't cut them either, I just folded them over like a little burrito. The kids ate all of them. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Huge hit here--apparently they want this again tomorrow.

I made the recipe according to instructions. The time to cook was way off.  At 18 minutes, the bites were VERY browned on the tops, and the bottoms were burned. They were barely edible, let alone good enough to bring to the party I was attending that evening. I cooked the bites at 375 degrees for 8-9 minutes. They came out much better. At  the proper cooking time, the bites are very good. I am giving this recipe three stars because  the recipe is not good if it is followed exactly.

Yum!  I used jalapeño smoked sausage and sliced it into bite-size pieces before wrapping it in biscuit.  I served it with extra sweet-hot mustard on the side for dipping as suggested.

I used regular mustard and crescent rolls and they were delicious! They are also super easy to assemble. Home run!
