Very good! I halved the dressing portion and that was plenty for us. The only thing I would change next time is to use 1/2 the oil, as it was a bit too oily, so I had to scoop out some of it. The flavor of the dressing is great and went well with the other ingredients. I will be making this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I LOVE this recipe!  My family was stuck in a rut with our regular rotation of vegetables, so I tried this salad as a side dish with roasted pork loin and it was a hit!!  I do recommend halving the dressing (although my husband bought more spinach and gladly finished off the leftovers)!  Also, we substituted sliced black olives for the fresh mushrooms.

I did drop the amount of oil.  This time around I believe I had too much sugar, not enough vinegar.  I need to learn to measure!  I see in the photo attached to the original recipe that dressing is on the side.  I think I'll try that next time.  Bacon should be well done.  Onions less done.  Love this and will make again and again

It was very tasty and was a hit with my guests.  Every bit was eaten.  It makes quite a bit and I think next time I will reduce the amount of oil used.  Good recipe.
