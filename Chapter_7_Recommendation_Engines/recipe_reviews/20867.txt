This is the first time I've cooked with zucchini, other than to just saute or grill it.  It was great! I consider recipes to be guidelines and always consider the recipe reviews.  Here are the changes I made: I used 2 cups of dry plain bread cubes, 2 eggs, Lawry's seasoning salt, 1 t of jarred roasted garlic, 1 cup of mozzarella (in an attempt to make it lighter), a chopped green onion and 3 cups of zucchini.  I also baked it in an 8 by 8 dish.  We had it as the main part of the meal and loved it, the bread was perfect and not mushy and the zucchini was tender. It had lots of flavor and the extra egg helped hold it together.  It surpassed my expectations and I plan to make it again except make a little more so it fills the 8 by 8 dish more.  Thank you for a yummy, inexpensive, beautiful to look at and nutritious recipe!

FABULOUS!! I loved this, hubby loved this, 18 month old loved this! Used some of the reviews to make this wonderful base recipe even better... used bottled minced garlic (2 tsp, we love garlic) an extra slice of bread, about a half cup more zucchini, 2 eggs, and I accidentally melted a half cup of butter, so I was naughty and added the whole thing :). I put 1/3 of the cheese mixed in the casserole sprinkled the rest on top. I added some Lawerys seasoning as well. Put in a 8x8 pan and cooked 20 minutes covered, 20 minutes uncovered. Perfection!

I love this recipe! I put in two zucchini plants this spring and thinking that I just may be overwhelmed by squash, and instead I wish I had planted another. This recipe is so simple and tasty. I like to vary the bread and found that chewy breads such as french or italian, lend a wonderful texture. Try differernt cheeses too. Monterrey Jack or Muenster are great. Other than that, I don't change a thing except maybe less onion. This casserole, along with a salad, has become one of my favorite meals. What makes it even more special is when I go to my desert garden and pick a lovely, fresh zucchini just for this dish! Plant some zucchini and you will be well rewarded.

this was okay.  It was the first time anyone in my family ate zucchini.  My only advice for when I make this again, cook it for only 45 minutes,  It was too hard and crunchy.  It would've been great otherwise. thanks

As I put it in the oven, I thought, "This doesn't have enough spices in it.  It's going to be bland."  But it wasn't!  It was a really nice side dish, tasty without overpowering.  I used a Monterrey Jack type cheese, and only about 1.5 cups (all I had).  I also used day-old bakery bread,  toasted in the toaster oven, but the 4 slices of that looked like too much bread, so I added another half-cup of zucchini.  Oh, and at that point, it looked too dry, so I added a second egg.  But even with all those adjustments, it came out very yummy.  I also used an 11x17 pan, based on another reviewer's suggestion.  I highly recommend this! It was an excellent compliment to a simple marinated, grilled chicken breast.

I brought this to my in-laws for dinner, and they loved it; I thought it was pretty good.  I used both zucchini and yellow squash, and I added an extra cup of it.  I used 2 slices of toasted bread and about 1-1/2 cups of chicken-flavored stuffing mix.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt (plenty of salt in the stuffing).  I think this is a good zucchini dish.  Thanks!

Loved this recipe. I used salad croutons (much crunchier than even toasted bread) and did like another reviewer did - put half cheese in with all the ingredients, then added the last half of cheese when I removed the cover and baked for the last uncovered 30 minutes. Voila!

I will caveat my comments by saying this recipe woudl be excellent exactly as written but due to some extra garden veggies we had on hand, my husbands love of spicy food and our desire to cut out some fat in our diet I made the following changes. It was excellent but I knwo the original would be excellent too. For those of you interested in the changes I made read on!  I used rustic olive bread cubed and toasted. Skipped the butter and used 2 Tbsp Olive oil instead. Added a diced pimiento ( Spanish long green pepper), one diced fresh tomato, 2 eggs not 1, pinch oregano,rosemary and cumin.  2 garlic cloves in place of garlic salt as we love garlic.  And as others noted I cut the cheese to 1 cup and sprinkled some red pepper flakes on top before baking. Excellent will definitely make this again!!!

This dish was awesome. I made it for a barbecue alongside a reliably good pasta/veggie mix and this dish was the one they demolished. I did make two changes I feel are necessary to the recipe, one being to toast the bread cubes. The egg/butter/cheese still coated the cubes and their crisp texture was perfect with the tender zucchini. I also melted the butter in a skillet, then cooked the chopped onion until soft but not brown. I can tell you from experience an hour at 350 won't take the raw bite out of the onions. The proportions of this dish were spot on and I have already been asked to make it again, thanks so much for sharing.

I love this! I did make a few changes to the recipe to suit my taste and weight goals. I used whole wheat, low cal bread (45 cal/slice); low-fat margarine instead of butter, 1/4c of egg beaters instead of an egg and Fat Free Cheddar Cheese mixed in and Low Fat Mozzarella sprinkled on top. I also add 2 tsps of minced garlic and 1 tsp of cayenne pepper (I like some spice). These few changes dropped the calorie count to 191/serving and tastes amazing.

I made this recipe as is, and it was excellent!  I cut down on the cooking time because I was hungry and didn't want to wait anymore, so it was in the oven a total of 45 minutes, turned out perfect.

To make this more of a meal, I added diced chicken.  I also added some chopped celery and a few tablespoons of parmesan cheese.  I used 3 Tbsp of butter rather than 4, and it was perfect!  My husband loved it, and he's weary of many of my zucchini dishes. It's one of my new favorite ways to use this abundant squash!

Very simple to make,would add cheese to the actual mix,as opposed to just sprinkling on top.Perhaps next time add more garlic salt to it.But,overall,very tasty indeed.

Very good and insanely easy!!  both my hubbie and my 18 mo old son liked it.  my only complaint is I felt it was a touch on the salty side and I used unsalted butter.  Next time I think I'm going to add some chopped broccoli to the mix but this will for sure be made again in our house.  P.S. between me, my hubbie and my 18 mo. old son there were no leftovers, we polished off the whole casserole :)

My Husband and I loved this recipe! We doubled it for the 9x13 pan, using 3 eggs, 1 large red onion, and only 2 cups of cheese (We used Mexican Four Cheese and it was amazing!).  It was perfect!!! The only change we thought we should make after that was to use more Zucchini - 5 cups Zucchini or one Large Zucchini. Teenagers did not like the texture. Hubby and I ate more than 1/2 the pan ourselves!

This recipe is fantastic. I toast the bread before cutting it up so it won't get soggy. Even my husband who doesn't like zucchini likes this!

Instead of bread I used Pepperidge Farms Herb Stuffing Mix.  Like others I sauteed the onions till soft and lightly golden.  I didn't have Cheddar cheese so I used Colby/Jack and it was tasty!  Will make again. Will use more zucchini/probably 3 Cups.

I used toasted garlic bread. I also sautéed the onions, garlic, zucchini and fresh cut up tomatoes first to cook off some of the liquid. Then I poured it over the toasted garlic bread then the cheese. It only took 20 minutes to bake in the oven.

I tried this recipe tonight as had lots of zucchini in fridge. I doubled the recipe all but the cheese. It turned out really nice, I did add a bit of mixed herbs as some said it was rather blah, it did the trick. I just had bread crumbs in the freezer so I used about 1cup for each slice. Also think next time will not uncover it as long, maybe 10 mins or so. Makes a really nice side dish

This was very good.  I took it to a church meal and everyone yummed it up.  There were only a few crumbs leftover.  Several people asked me for the recipe. I used some yellow squash w/ the zucchini.   I doubled the recipe except for the cheese, although I think between the yellow squash and the zucchini I had about 7 cups of veggies.  I split the cheese and put half inside and half on top.  I thought it was delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was the first time I got my 13 year old son to eat zucchini without a grumble!  It was delicious.  I served it with marinated grilled chicken steaks, cherry tomatoes and cucumber for an easy midweek meal!

Husband said this was the most delicious zucchini casserole he's ever eaten.  Did make a few changes due to my family's preferences.  Added additional cup of zucchini, extra egg, used fresh crushed garlic, seasoned salt, mixed 1/2 of cheese with mixture, pinch of dried oregano & pinch of dried parsley.  Baked in 8x8 casserole dish.  Will make again!

Delicious.  A tad over done veggies but still delicious to a person who hates mushy veggies.  I changed things a little .... used GF bread crumbs (small amount as it was all I had), 3 C. zucchini, 2 eggs, 1/3 C. Cheddar cheese in mixture and 1 1/3 C. Cheddar cheese on top.  I used a Pyrex dish 8" x 11" and baked it just under the required time.  Next time I would add crushed or sliced garlic.   What a wonderful find.  Thank you.

This was great. I used my homeade french bread. Thanks for posting. I planted 2 late zuccini plants for seed and I have more than enough of it now.

i used minced garlic and whole wheat bread.  baked in an 8x8 for the recommended time.  i also used 1/2 the cheese but a bit more wouldn't hurt.  My wife is not a veggie fan yet the leftovers are missing.  I bet she took them to work...

I really liked this dish. I used toasted asagio french bread and cubed it. I should have diced the zuchini a little smaller, and probably would saute the onions before I mix them in. I served it with "Chickless Parmegan" (vegetarian) and the marinara sauce went really well with the zucchini casserole. It was good and I will certainly make it again.

I rated this recipe a 4 because my husband and everyone at the church potluck absolutely loved this dish. I thought it was ok but my taste buds aren't 100% right now so I based the rating off of the reviews I received. I did adjust the recipe a bit because I tripled it and I never really measure anything. I did toast the bread first, added cheese to the mix and it sat in the fridge over night so that when it baked up it was almost like a cheesy bread casserole with zucchini (and yellow squash) here and there. I also added a bit of celery chopped really fine and a few additional spices. 
Aside from that, all else remained the same. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a great way to use fresh summer zucchini!  I had a few extra zucchini that I needed to use, so I added an extra egg and some breadcrumbs to the mixture.  It was a hit!  We will make it again for sure!

It was easy to make with my kids but a large onion was a bit strong. A 9 by 13 pan is too large it comes out as a very thin layer. I will use a smaller pan and less onion next time. Good easy way to get kids involved in making veggies though :)

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  The house smells great while it is baking! I did shorten the bake time as well, 30 minutes covered and only about 15 uncovered.  I also tried adding cooked ground beef to the mixture, and then a layer a fresh sliced tomatoes on top before adding the cheese.  It made a wonderful meal and helped use up some more garden produce!

I thought this recipe was delicious.  Although some thought it was too bready.  I think I'll add a little less bread next time.  I also added 1/2cup extra cheese.  Kids enjoyed it... I think because of all the cheese.  I will make again with the alterations.

I altered this recipe right away because it didn't seem like enough to fit a 9X13.  I used more of everything except the onion--I only added half an onion.  I also added some ground black pepper.  We really enjoyed it and I'll be making it again.

This was AWESOME and EASY!  Didn't take more than 10 minutes to prep and then you can relax while it bakes!  I made it pretty much to the recipe but added 1 extra slice of bread, 1 extra TBSP of butter and 1 extra egg

I used day old Italian bread, and thought this had good flavor and a decent texture, right out of the oven. Reheated the next day, the texture was unpleasantly sponge-like. After thought - My zucchini and bread cubes were large, and I think this would have been much better if I had cubed them very small.

This was better than I thought it would be.  I added a few extra ingredients- can of diced tomatoes and some chopped green olives. I forgot the egg, but I don't know that it mattered.  I think adding ground turkey or pork would turn this into a tasty entree.

We followed the recipe pretty closely, except added 2 eggs (instead of 1), used both yellow squash and zucchini, and mixed in 1# browned bulk sausage before baking. It was very good.

First off, I was very glad to find a zucchini casserole that didn't call for canned soup! It was very easy to prepare and was delicious! I used about 1 cup more zucchini only because I underestimated how much my zucchini would yield and I didn't want to waste it, and I used 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic and a little less than 1 tsp. sea salt. Otherwise I followed the recipe and was very pleased. Thanks so much!

Difficult to rate this one... we ate it, it was ok, good way to use up that zucchini from the garden... but I wasn't too impreseed. I would definitely like to try another zucchini casserole recipe. I think it might have been the bread that I didn't like too much.

Amazing!! I made this gluten free by using Udi's white sandwich bread and was worried the GF bread would be soggy, but it turned out perfect. I also used half yellow squash and half zucchini, and added in cubed red potatoes. I did add salt, pepper, parsley, oregano, and thyme since the herb/spice ingredients looked a little bland. It was amazing and everyone in the house ate seconds.

This was really good! For the first time ever my husband ate something with zucchini!  I made a few minor alterations for what I had on hand. 3 cups of zucchini, mixed in some mozzarella cheese and put a handful of sharp cheddar on top. Oh and I put it in a 8X8 pan and which seemed about right.

This is a solid recipe, but nothing over-the-top. I like that it is a well-rounded side, meaning it's a veggie and a starch so I don't need to make two sides. It's easy to prepare but does take a long time to bake. I used whole wheat bread, but I think white would've been better. I'd make it again if I had zucchini to get rid of.

I really liked this, but of course with the changes I made...I doubled the zucchini, I was desperate to use a lot.  I used croutons instead of bread and real garlic instead of garlic salt!

This was very easy to put together.  I followed "the bunny chef's" ideas and added the extra egg and used 3 cups of zucchini and placed it in an 8x8 pan sprayed with oil.  Everyone loved it including the kids

I made this last night - loved it. My husband came home late and devoured the rest - loved it. I sauteed the onion in olive oil along with some garlic so I didn't add the butter. Also I accidently shredded the zucchini instead of cutting it up - didn't matter - it was still great. The only thing I ever make weekly is pizza - but I think this will become a weekly dinner as long as the zucchini is growing. Thanks DC1 PS. I also toasted the bread and added a second egg. I used motz. and  montery jack cheese. Even though I love cheese on things - I think I only used just over a cup. I did stir some of the cheese into the casserole and put the rest on top. My husband thinks I should sell this!!!

I tried this and only made one change, I grated a clove of garlic into the butter and then melted the butter. This was a great side dish and my husband said it was the BOMB!! If you like zucchini/onion mixture, you will love this.

This recipe was VERY good..... the only thing I would definitely do differently next time would be to bake it for only 45 minutes.... 30 minutes covered and another 15 without being covered.By cooking for a full 30 minutes uncovered the cheese burned. :(

Very easy and idiot proof!!! You can fiddle with the amounts and ingredients and it will still be very good. My family LOVED it the first tiem I made it. Second time I used less butter and you couldn't tell the difference. NOTE: if you are covering it with foli, be sure to butter the inside of the foil (as you would with any similar dish.

This was so good.  Of course I had to make a few changes. I had more zucchini than the recipe called for so I ended up using 4 cups of zucchini and added a cubed bagel along with the bread. I also added the extra egg like others recommended. Everyone enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again.

SO-SO easy and delicious! A great way to use all that extra zucchini. I took the tips of other reviewers and toasted the bread first (thicker bread that can be cubed works best, in my opinion). Also, the thought of baking this for an hour in the summer heat didn't appeal to me, so I pre-cooked zucchini and onion in a saute pan for about 15-20 minutes before I put it in the oven, uncovered, for another 20 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be very good. I toasted whole wheat bread to use in the dish. Next time I think I will use less butter as I found the dish to be a little greasy, but hey, that's what makes it delicious. The timing described in the recipe is just right and I love that you can probably add all kinds of veggies and easily make modifications. Will make this again with whatever I have on hand.

This was really good.  A great way to use up zucchini in summer!  It tastes great suprisingly since it is so basic plus it is really easy to make.  I did fry off the onion & used crushed garlic with it.  Was still good.  I have now added a few slices of tomato to the top also to use up those when I have had too many.  Great stuff!

I liked the idea of this recipe but I did a few changes. I used 3 cups of zuchinni, I cooked the onions in butter then added them, 1 chopped tomatoe, salt, pepper and garlic. I recommend using smaller zuchinni because they are not as bitter as the bigger ones but the bigger ones still work. Thank you for the recipe Dixie.

I made this dish for my family.  I used, as others recommended, more zucchini; I also used less cheese, English muffins that were slightly toasted, and left out the garlic salt.  My father especially liked this recipe.  My mother and I both thought that something was missing and it was not any of the items that I did not include.  Next time, I think that I will brown the onions before mixing them in.

This was the first zucchini dish I've ever made, and I now know I love zucchini, but was not too impressed with this dish.  I used leftover chicken cubes and andouille sausage which added flavor, but the bread cubes were really soggy and got picked out.  The next day we tried eating the leftovers but ended up throwing it away.  Everything was soggy and runny; possibly due to the mushy bread, egg, and cheese. I won't make this again.

This recipe was really good it was so tempting to eat it while it was baking because the smell was overwhelming.  I also used emmenthal (like swiss cheese) instead of cheddar because I can not get it where I am.  It came out excellent and I could not imagine eating it with cheddar.  Also instead of garlic salt I used adobo (a spice by goya) which contains salt, garlic, and spanish spices.  It gave it a real nice kick.  I also mixed a bit of chesse into the mixture before adding the 2 cups of cheese on top.  My boyfriend loved it as well and I will definitly make this again.  Also it can be used as a light main dish for lunch witha  salad on the side.

My family loved this dish! My dad had two helpings and wanted more. It was a nice change to the usual fair at dinner. It is hard to find variety with Diabetic recipes.  This fit right into the carbohydrate diet we follow. Thanks!

This is excellent.  I didn't change any ingredients but I did toast the bread and then I poured the butter with fresh garlic over the bread before I mixed in the remaining ingredients.  I had several compliments on this dish when I took it to a cookout.  It's a keeper.

Loved this! Delicious! Like many others, I made a few changes:
Used both zukes and yellow squash; added a little parmesan and a dash of cayenne to the mixture; sauteed the onion first; used a little more squash and a little less bread; AND, best of all....I added a topping of crushed cornflakes with a little butter after uncovering and baking some more. That really made it yummy! We will definitely have this often! 
I will try some of the ideas that I've seen here, like adding sausage to make a main dish meal.

I use gluten free bread, and it is great! I have to double because my son wants leftovers to take back to college. Sometimes I sprinkle cooked bacon over the top. I like this recipe because it doesn't call for creamed soups, which is great if you can't have gluten.!

We cut the recipe in half. It says that this is a side dish that serves four, but that has to be wrong. I think this recipe easily feeds eight as a side. As a main dish, I could see it feeding four to six people. Another thing to watch out for is the size of zucchini dice you use. It isn't specified in the recipe. We used a 1/4" dice and it turned out really nice. It was tender, but not mushy. If we had cut the zucchini like we normally do, we would have ended up with undercooked zucchini. I think the amount of onion was just right, but my wife thinks there was too much. We both liked this recipe quite a lot. We will make it again, but I am looking forward to making a few additions. Bacon never hurt any recipe, and I wonder how cream cheese would work in this recipe, with cheddar still sprinkled on top, of course!

The baking time took far longer than listed. Perhaps thin slices would bake faster. 

It was a little on the plain side. I recommend adding cooked diced chicken, two diced tomatoes, and some fresh basil.

Awesome, great way to add zucchini to your menu. We ate it as a meal instead of a side, so I added some imitation crab meat that I diced up, 3 different types of cheese I had on hand, celery, onion, and a few dashes of Old Bay.  Served it with hot rolls, and it was all gone but one little piece - that I have to add was even better after sitting in the fridge overnight!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Great starter recipe. I sauteed the onions and fresh garlic. Then added a 5 Italian cheese blend instead of cheddar. The zucchini was perfect, not mushy.

I made this today for Christmas dinner at my niece's. I added minced garlic as some other reviewers mentioned. I doubled bread, zucchini, eggs but still just one sweet yellow onion and the 1/2 stick of butter was plenty. I toasted the bread (used gluten free for my niece, worked fine). I mixed some cheese in and then 1/2 way after removing foil added some to top. I used a foil 9x12 pan. It had wonderful flavor. Everyone enjoyed it very much. I will be making it again in an even larger quantity for a large potluck on NYE. I am going to try garlic croutons to make it even easier. Thank you DCI, this is one of my best keepers. Guaranteed I will be asked for this recipe at the potluck!

It surprised me how much I liked this. It's sort of like a poor man's easy quiche. 

Like other posters, I cooked my onions until transparency before adding them, along with some fresh garlic. I also toasted the bread crumbs, drizzled them with butter and layered them on top (mixing the cheese with the vegetables) in hopes that they wouldn't get soggy. They didn't. 45 minutes of cooking time was just right for me. Other than that, I followed the recipe--no seasoning salt or extra eggs required.

My husband especially liked it.

FABULOUS!!  My husband and children devoured this dish~even the one that does not like zucchini!  Added 1/4 cup red bell pepper, 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and a little pepper to the zucchini mixture.  I will be making this dish often!!!

very simple, yet delicious! I liked that it was the kind of recipe you mix everything, set a timer, and forget about it! (till the timer goes off!) I toasted my bread cubes in the oven (350 degrees) until just starting to golden and I used different kind of cheese, Colby Monterrey was all we had in the fridge. This is the kind of thing that would be good with any cheese! 
easy, cheap, delicious :)

This dish was absolutely delicious. I followed some other suggestions in the reviews and made with 5 slices of bread, 3 cups of zucchini and 2 eggs. Baked covered for 30 and uncovered for 20. Perfection!

I liked the idea of this casserole, but I was not happy with the way it turned out. It was somewhat soggy, and 1 large onion made it VERY oniony. That's all I could taste! If I made it again I would put much less onion. Also, I would saute the bread cubes in the butter to toast them since the 1/4 cup of butter seemed to make it soggy.

I agree with another that a recipe is just guide line. After reading several reviews this what I came up with. The big difference was I added 2 plum tomatoes next time I will add more maybe half zucchini and half tomato.  Used fresh garlic Andres some black pepper. Made this for a dinner with a few neighbors and told them they were going to be ginnea pigs. Every one loved and and wanted the recipe. I will be making this for my family reunion next weekend.

I used 1/2 bag of cheesy/garlic croutons and smashed them up alittle bit instead of the bread.  My whole family raved about it.  Will definitely make it again now that I have abumper crop of zucchini.

This recipe was really quick and easy to make, and best of all, my toddler who hates everything I make actually asked for another serving! I did 3 eggs instead of 1, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Would have given it 5 stars except it seemed really salty, I will use less garlic salt next time.

I made this casserole for a bbq because i had a massive amount of zucchini left over from the farmers market, and no time to go to the store.  it was quick & easy, and i think that almost every person at the bbq asked me for the recipe!! i was a little nervous because i didnt have enough chedder, and had to sub some mozz,  and the only bread i had was whole grain bread.  i also nearly doubled the recipe and mixed the cheese into the dish.  Regardless, it came out excellent!  i dont think ive ever gotten so many compliments on a dish, and its one of the easiest dishes ive ever made to share!!

We loved this. Made this with left over french bread.  I just eyeballed the recipe and realized I added too much bread so I added another egg.  My husband couldnt get enough of this.  I covered this with foil shaped like a tent over the casserole, then took the foil off half way through.  I do not recommend this.  The cheese and bread get a little hard and chewy.  Next time I will just keep it covered.

My hubby and I really enjoyed this! I used light cheddar cheese, adding 1/2 in the dish itself. I also just threw some garlic croutons in the food processor instead of using crumbs, so I could omit the butter in the topping. I added some garlic in with the zucchini. I will be making this again!

I cut up four SMALL zucchini and when I realized that I had three cups of chopped zucchini, I looked for a review that closely matched my needs...I followed "Nancy's" advice.  I cubed four slices of wheat bread, 1/4 cup melted light margarine, 1/4 large chopped purple onion, 1 tsp minced garlic, 2 beaten eggs, and 1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese. I sprayed an 8 x 8 glass pan with Pam and covered with foil also sprayed with Pam. I baked at 350 covered for 30 mins. then uncovered for 20 mins. My family thought this was a little bland but when served with Tabasco sauce, it was a huge hit.  I guess that means that cayenne pepper would be a nice addition to the dish...

Very easy, tasty way to use all that zucchini! I made two small changes, otherwise kept as written. I used less onion, about 2/3 large one, and less garlic salt, 2/3 tsp. The result was just fine. Having done it once I may play with it little-add mushrooms, bacon, or ground turkey for instance. It's a good recipe. Enjoy!

I could make a whole meal out of this. Melted the butter in a large pan than stirred in bread fallowed by the other ingredients. Placed in an 11x9 backing dish and baked according to directions. The bottom and edges were  browned and chew to perfection and the zucchini and center were nice and moist. Mmmm.

FANTASTIC.  Addictive, in fact.  I chose to saute the onions and mix 2/3 of the cheese in with the other ingredients, and I toasted the bread.  I love onions, but if you aren't crazy about them, reduce to 1/2 an onion.  I'll be making this a lot.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I tried this recipe last night. I normally don't cook with zucchini, but I had some given to me. It was an ok dish. The casserole was a little dry. My kids and hubby did not like it at all. I will not be making this again.

Can I say YUM enough.  The first time I made this recipe my family loved it.  The next 2 times I made it I used roasted garlic Tuscan bread and then Hawiian Sweet Bread and my family went nuts!  Thank you for this one!!

This was delicious!  I've made it twice in one week - at the request of a non-veggie lover!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was tasty but didn't hold together firmly.  The second time, I followed advice from some other reviewers and used unseasoned stuffing mix instead of cubed bread and I also upped the spice with more garlic and some cayenne pepper.  It held together better the second go round.  This dish is ideal to bring to a pot luck - everyone will enjoy it.  I'll definitely be adding it to the regular rotation!

Great recipe. I will double the ingredients the next time I make this as it didn't quite fill the pan. I'll also use 2 cups more zucchini and 1/2 onion. Will also use less cheese. 
Great side dish!

An excellent zuke casserole!  However, I did cut back on the bread cubes and increased the amount of zuke.  I also added some hot pepper sauce and I stirred some of the cheese through the casserole and sprinkled the remainder on top.  My family really enjoyed this dish.  Thanks, Dixie.

4.75 / 5 stars - because it tasted SO good! My alterations: I used zucchini & yellow squash, and even added carrots. I used minced onions instead of chopping my own.

Though I toasted my bread first, they were still soggy. However, I think it was my fault due to the egg. I am going to experiment because I am making this for Thanksgiving :)

If you follow this recipe, with or without all the cheese, I bet it will turn out well. We really liked this dish.

Pretty good - but could use a bit more kick. I added mushrooms because I didn't have 2 cups of zucchini. I also used smoked cheddar for a bit more flavor. It still needed a little kick so I put some carne guisada over it that I had also made that night. That did the trick! I would make this again when I've got some extra zucchini but would maybe add some hot pepper sauce to the butter. Good recipe - thanks :)

This is a good new way to use up zucchini from the garden.  I used a little less cheese and will experiment with different cheeses next time I try it.

I use crookneck squash with this recipe. I use a large onion, decrease cheddar a bit and add some mozzarella. My husband and I love it. My 3 y.o. on the other hand has to be pressured to taste it and once he finally does, which takes FOREVER, he says Mmmmmm! We love this comfort food.

Very easy to make and delicious.  I prepared all but the last 3 minutes in the microwave.
What I did was first melt the butter in a small casserole, then stir in the toasted bread cubes.
Then I placed everything else in the casserole, except the cheese and cooked it covered in the microwave for 5 minutes.  Then grated the cheese on top and ran it under the broiler of my oven for three minutes to melt and brown the cheese.  My husband really enjoyed it.  
Not only is it quicker, it also saves a lot of energy.

Great use of zucchini in a new way. I prefer two eggs tho after making several times both ways. It’s very much like a stuffing with half the carbs!!  My daughter LOVES it and asks for it often. Covers a vegetable and side in one dish!  I use whatever bread I have on hand, often a mixture of wheat and white, always a denser quality bread vs a sandwich loaf. I cube and let sit on the counter to dry prior to assembling. I use fresh garlic and onion I have on hand ( white red green etc). I mix the cheese in saving a small amount to sprinkle on top once uncovered. Great even heated up with a poached egg on top for brunch!

Very easy to make, but did make some changes by advice of others . I doubled the recipe to 8 servings which fit very nicely in a 9x13 glass baking dish. Changes are as follows.:
...Diced Italian bread then toasted in oven at 350
...only used 1/2 amount of butter
...Put 1/2 the cheese into casserole/ other 1/2 on top after removing the foil
...Lightly Saute onions in the butter
...Doubled the amount of eggs from 2 to 4
...Added 1/2 tsp pepper
Someone had suggested adding basil to the mix. I have a cooking spray of olive oil and basil flavoring. I used this to grease the pan. I think it added a nice flavor to it. 
My zucchini was frozen. I was afraid that it would be too watery, so I let it defrost on kitchen towels to absorb excess moisture. I mixed the eggs with butter and spices in a small bowl, than poured over all the other ingredients that I had put into  a larger bowl.
Last, but not least...I baked 20 minutes covered with foil, then added the top cheese at this point and only left it in long enough to melt the additional cheese...about 15 minutes.
The end result was fantastic...enjoy!!!

I mixed half of the cheese into the casserole - half on top.  Lots more zucchini than called for in recipe because my garden is overflowing right now.  Add breadcrumbs because the excess zukes will add more moisture.

I substituted the bread with big salad croutons. I like the Garlic and herb croutons.9obviously they are already hard toasted)  It helped the moisture and added flavor. I have a garden and my zucchini was out of control. I'd recommend this recipe to anyone!

I made this last night and it disappeared in no time. I did change a few things. I used sourdough bread, smoked sharp cheddar cheese and pepperjack cheese instead. Otherwise I everything else in the recipe stayed the same. Wil make this again for sure. Thanks for the recipe!

I got a lot of great compliments on this very easy & quick recipe. Very simple and easy to follow for someone like me who is not a wiz in the kitchen. I will most likely add more cheese and another egg next time. And possibly sprinkle some bacon on top just to give it a little extra flavor but was definitely great as is.

Love zucchini and this was great! I tried this recipe with a few changes: 
1) used 2 cups of herb seasoned croutons,
2) increased the zucchini to 2 1/2 cups,
3) doubled the eggs,
4) mixed the 1 cup cheddar cheese in with the rest of the ingredients,
5) and topped the casserole with about 2/3 cup of Tex Mex shredded cheese
6) Baked it in an 8x8 glass pan...turned out a bit crusty in places so next time will bake at 325F instead.

Yum! Will definitely make it again!

I needed a full meal, so I added cooked chicken sausage. It was a hit! I edited how it was cooked since I didn't want my oven on so long in this hot weather. I toasted the bread in the oven as it was heating up and cooked the onions and sausage in the butter on the stove and added real garlic, salt and pepper. I microwaved the zucchini which took the excess water out of it and only used half the cheese. I didn't see a need for the egg so I didn't add it. These small cheats saved a lot of oven time. :)

Made this exactly as written. Strangely, it reminded me of cheesy potatoes!! In a good way. I loved that the cheese got kind of dark and hard over the top. The zucchini was done perfectly, not overly seasoned. Adding garlic would likely enhance a bit! Also, 2 eggs would coat the bread a bit better but I used one and it came out fine. Just don't expect it to spread liberally over all the bread cubes. It only came up half way in the pan, so if you double you could still get it all into the 13x 9. I love that it's quick and easy. Basic ingredients. Perfect dish to throw together in a pinch or to use up your bumper crop.

I had made the Zucchini Tomato Casserole, but made it with Italian cheese blend instead of cheddar. It was Italian tasting so when I made this I went the Mexican route. I had some jalapeno hamburg buns that were stale and used 4 of them in place of the bread (the whole buns, as some reviews said their bread was mushy). I also used 2 eggs as another reviewer had suggested. If I had any ripe tomatoes, I would have added them as well. So after I baked this, I served topped with salsa and sour cream.  DELICIOUS!!! 

I made this AGAIN today, adding chopped roma tomatoes and 1 chopped jalapeno.  I forgot the eggs, but since I mixed 1/2 c of cheese into the vegetable mixture, it still held together pretty good.  I love this casserole!!

YUM!! Exceeded expectations!! I took the advise of another person and used the "chewier" bread (french bread) and I also used a half can of sliced black olives (drained). Absolutely Delicious! Will be making again and sharing the recipe. Thank you for sharing this !

Well this was excellent,  but due to missing a few things I had to substitute. I used 4 cups croutons that had poultry seasoning in it. I used 1/4 of a large sweet onion, chopped and sautéed it in the butter then two small minced garlic cloves to the cooking onion. Then I added it to the croutons. Since I had probably three cups of zucchini I used two extra large eggs beaten and added the cheese to the egg and used half of it into the zucchini/ crouton mixture. Mother rest of the cheese rest of the cheese went on top. I cooked it for a full hour we ate it all, between 4 people. It was delicious. We will definitely make this again with all the zucchini we have in our garden.

I ran across this recipe when I had some Zucchini and Yellow/Summer Squash that needed to be used up pronto!  I also was in need of a trip to the grocery store with limited "gazintas" on hand.  It sounded boring when I read it, but I had the necessary ingredients/gazintas on hand, so why not give it a whirl?  I LOVE this recipe!!!  It is deceivingly flavorful and scrumptious!  It's a great use - up for your tons of harvest of zucchini & summer squash and that stale bread.  Thanks for the recipe!  Delish!

I really enjoyed this. I made this exactly as the instructions were written. Next time I make this, and I will definitely make again, I will cook 30 minutes covered at 350 degrees, then I will uncover and turn my oven on low for the remaining 30 minutes. The cheese ended up too done for my liking. I wanted more gooey cheese on top, but I ended up with browned, crispy cheese. All in all, this is the only thing I would change. :)

Oh my heavens this was yummy!  I took other's suggestions and toasted the bread first. That really helped to keep the bread from getting soggy. I added 3 eggs. Came out beautifully! Will be making this a lot!

Family loved this dish.  I had a little more zucchini so added a few croutons and an extra egg.  Also added a small amount of crumbled bacon and some fresh chopped tomatoes and as others suggested, mixed some of the cheese in and then put the rest on top.  It wasn't watery at all.

It's been years since I've made a dish using bread as a filler, but they were one of my favorite ways of cooking!  Great way to use old or dried bread.  I do recommend that you use a "substantial" bread, such as French, Italian, etc. A/R has many wonderful recipes, including this one.  The best part of this recipe, is that you can use it as it's written, or you can add flavorings, such as green chilies (sp?), or chopped tomatoes or whatever!  HTH!  Blessings!!!

So good. I tweaked it a bit by adding french fried onions instead of chopped, and since I didn't have any bread,  I added 1 C. of Italian bread crumbs.  I used chopped garlic instead of garlic salt, and mixed 1 cup of cheese into the mix, plus 1 C on top.  When it was done, I placed sliced Swiss cheese slices on half of the casserole (since not everyone in my family likes Swiss}.  It melted beautifully into the mix.
I recommend cubing 4 C of zucchini, as the two cups only filled an 8x10 deep dish casserole dish.

I chopped the zucchini into smaller pieces than normal "cubing" would leave. 

I halved the onion and grated it, used 1 large garlic clove (minced) instead of garlic salt, sauteed the garlic and onion before adding them to the mix. I also baked it in an 9x9 Corningware dish instead of a 9x13 since that would have made it thin as a cracker. It was a huge hit with my family. 

Oh, I used Orowheat White bread and it was delicious, but next time I may try artisan Italian bread.

This was a huge hit at our family's big 4th of July party. I got compliments from everyone, and was asked to make it for future parties. The changes I made: doubled the recipe, toasted the bread before cubing, seasoned with Lawry's Salt, and added half the cheese to the mixture and half on top during the last 5 minutes of baking. It was great, and I will definitely make it again.

I liked this recipe. I used a small onion instead of a large one and I added another 1/2 cup of zucchini, for a total of 2 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups. I also didn't have garlic salt so I just used some Happy Salt ( a salt mixture with garlic and other spices) and a little pepper. Like someone else said, I didn't think it would be very flavorful, but it really was. I'll make this again.

This is extremely delicious. I didn't do the butter method.. I just sautéed the onions in 1 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp of olive oil - until browned.  I browned the bread to crisp it up. added a handful of chopped tomato for extra juice.  It came out perfect and not soggy.  totally yummy.  I imagine with this recipe you could add any veggies and it would be delicious.  Thank you!

Made this with seasoned bread crumbs, a little milk and some salt and pepper added and my husband liked it and my son loved it.  I found it a little bland even with the additions to seasoning.  I also cooked it a little longer as the zucchini wasn't quite soft enough.  Will make it again with more seasoning.

Fabulous!  I added chopped fresh basil.  I didn't have onions so I used fresh chives.  I used a blend of cheeses including parmesan.  The flavors worked really well together.

WAY too much bread for the amount of zucchini. If I make this again, I'll make sure to use less bread or maybe some crumbled ritz crackers instead.

Well, I thought it was decent. My kids normally like most foods, but they did not like this at all. I gave it a three because I really feel like it was the zucchini, not the recipe. They must not be big fans of zucchini?!? I agree with others, maybe some kind of meat our sausage would help.

this was OK, but i would only use 1/2 an onion, sauteed first and add other cheeses....i subbed 1/4 c. of the cheddar into pepper jack and sprinkled the top with parmesan.....i also mixed the cheese into it instead of putting it on top....my kids hated it....i liked it....just glad to have something else to do with all the zucchini!....

Delicious! I made this as a side dish for Christmas Eve dinner exactly as the recipe calls and there weren't any leftovers. It's super easy and very tasty! I used an Italian loaf for my bread and it was perfect!

I made as written - wasn't crazy about this! Kind of flavourless and some soggy patches (maybe my bread chunks were too big...) but it's quick and it used up some zucchini!

This was yummy! I added boiled and shredded chicken breast to make it more of a main dish. Additionally, toasted the bread, used half chopped red onion, 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese, and 1 cup Monterrey Jack cheese. I topped it with some finely shredded fresh Parmesan. It was AWESOME!

I made this as the main course, next time I think it will work better as a side. 
Also, I think I will increase the amount of zucchini I use, I didn't think 2 cups was enough. 
Great recipe!

My family thought this was pretty good.  I also only baked for 45 minutes.  I used two eggs instead of one, otherwise I think it would have been way too dry.
Even though, we liked it, it seemed to need something more. Next time, I'll try adding something. Maybe another veggie or bacon bits?

I took care of the watery zucchini, I cooked the zucchini in the microwave for about 5-6 minutes, then added the butter and onion. I also added homemade taco seasoning and cilantro and added cheese to the top.

I made this to go with spaghetti using last season's zucchini I had frozen.  I used a LOT less cheese, though.  It was a bit on the dry side that way, but absolutely delicious when eaten with spaghetti sauce and I will try it again without sauce when I have fresh zucchini.

This has the potential to be an awesome recipe. I would change one thing and that would be the bread. I did a light multi-grain bread and it was awful with the dish. I think next time I'll go with white and make sure it's really toasted. Other than the bread, it tasted excellent.

I needed a quick easy recipe in a hurry and this looked good.  I can't believe how good it actually was!  All I had was 12 grain bread, and the only cheese I had was the new Bistro Blends, Cheddar salsa with tomato and jalapeno peppers.  Everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  There was a samll amount left and I had it for lunch the next day.  It was every bit as good as the day before.  Thanks for a great recipe.

excellent!   I too, changed just a few things - used stuffing mix (roasted garlic flavor), sauteed a couple of Vidalias to throw in, and used a mix of zucchini and yellow squash.   My family will eat these if I press the issue - but you'd have never caught one of them saying, "I love zucchini" - until now!!  Good job, submitter!!

I had extra zucchini, so I added about half a can of cream of chicken soup and some milk.  But, it turned out great.  I served for a family dinner and there was none left!

I thought this was really good. I used 3 cups of zuccini tho and just sprinkled the top with cheese....didn't use the 2 cups it called for. Also I just baked it covered for 35 minutes and took it out. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was a very yummy side dish!  I cooked the onions in the butter before adding them, because I didn't want them to be too strong.  It turned out great!

I doubled the recipe to fit an 8x11 pan (except for the cheese, which I kept at 2 cups, and the onion).  I also added some Montreal Chicken seasoning for flavor.  Great recipe(except for the fat content!!)Everyone loved it!A keeper.

I thought this was really good, but my husband thought only OK.  He doesn't like a lot of cheese so I only used 1 cup instead of 2 and he thought it was still too much.  ANd my kids wouldn't touch it because they are really picky eaters and won't eat anything green.  However, I will make it again for company and also pass this along.  It was very easy and a good way to use up zucchini from the garden.

I increased the zucchini to 3 cups and decreased the onion size to a small one.  I also baked it in a 2-qt. casserole dish.  It was very good and very easy.

I though it needed more zucchini and less of the onion.  The taste was fine, it just needed something else, I'm not sure what it is though.

My husband and I love this recipe.  Its an easy and delicious way to upgrade your holiday stuffing or add sausage and its dinner all on its own.  A couple notes.   If you're multiplying the recipe keep the same amount of butter.  You need alot less than you think.  Add a little poultry seasoning to give it some good flavor.   I find the onion to be a little overwhelming so i used half the amount.  Enjoy!

Simple to make and delicious.  I did two changes to the second batch I made which improved it to my taste.  First, for the bread, I used an asiago sourdough cubed, and browned them in the melted butter till a little crispy.  I follow the recipe then as directed up to the shredded cheese instruction.  I mixed half the shredded cheese into the mixture, and topped with the rest.  The original version is delicious, the changes I made time two worked great too.  I ended up making it several times again over the zucchini harvest month, and everyone loved it.  Thank you

I made changes such as toasting the bread first, sauteing the vegetables instead of boiling and I used a smaller pan. I also used Mrs Dash Original spice to give it more flavor. It was good, especially fresh but not so good left over. When you reheat it, the bread gets really soggy. I could see this recipe working better without the bread and adding some sausage instead. Especially if you want to eat the leftovers.

I’ve made this twice and getting ready to do it again. It’s a great recipe for zucchini season! I used San Francisco sourdough for my bread, Irish style butter and an extra clove of sautéed garlic because garlic. On my second bake I added two more eggs with more and different cheeses. Lots of different ways to play with this recipe. Really easy to make.

Like most people I made some changes.  I followed the recipe except I added 2 eggs because 1 didn't seem enough to coat everything.  I also added some additional spices. (italian seasoning) And I added cooked smoke sausage pieces.  It turned out nice.  Everyone liked it and asked for more.  Oh I also mixed in some of the cheese then added some on top.

This was really good.  We plant zucchini every year and I end up with a ton by summer's end.  I followed other's suggestions to toast the bread first (good ).  Used less cheese too.

i followed some suggestions, toasted the bread first and added cheese to the mixture, also cooked it for 45 min instead of the whole hour. my husband would not eat it, i ate it and the flavor was ok, but the bread was still very soggy at the bottom and zucchinni was overcooked and mushy.  won't make this again.

Made it just as directed. It was delish. I served it with fish and it was a hit. Crispy, done perfectly and cheesy.

I used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the bread, and an extra egg to hold it together. I also mixed in some of the cheese as well as a sprinkle on top. Everyone loved it!

We really enjoyed this. Only change was to bake it with 2/3 of the cheese mixed in. Topped it with the final 1/3 and let it bake a few minutes afterwards to melt the topping.

The recipe does not specify how large to cut the chunks of bread and zucchini. After making this, I can say smaller is better. I used two eggs, as other reviewers did, and mixed the cheese in with everything else, and it still fell apart. It was delicious, however. I think the next time I make it, I will shred the zucchini.

Made a few changes. Added 1 yellow onion diced, 2 tsp minced garlic, chopped celery, 1 lb bacon chopped and cooked w/onion, garlic, celery and seasoned with black pepper. 

Prepared corn bread muffin mix  & added double amount of zucchini to muffin mix. Spray 9x13 casserole dish w/cooking spray and dumped zucchini mixture in. 
Next the cooked drained chopped bacon, onion, and garlic goodness on top of zucchini. Last but not least Velveeta cheese slices top it all off. Baked @400°F for 30 min sides of dish should be bubbly. 
AWESOME! SO GOOD!
 Although I wish I would have remembered to add either an extra egg to muffin mix or 4 tbsp of butter or margarine. Possibly would have even worked to bake covered for part of the time.

Very tasty. Most of the family enjoyed. It is a different way of serving zucchini. The mixing of the onions and the zucchini go well together and the cheese just tops it off. We will make it again.

Really enjoyed this.   Had about a cup more zucchini than called for (that I included ) and was out of cheddar cheese so I used a Mexican 4 cheese mix.  Made it a second time with yellow squash  and cheddar cheese and it was really good too.  Think it would be even better if you toasted the bread cubes  as some people have mentioned.

The baking time was longer than needed, so I cut it down to 40 minutes.  (30 covered, 10 minutes uncovered).  The kids asked me to make it again - everyone loved it.  The bread was a little soggy, but i think next time I'll try toasting it first.

A great way to use all those summer zucchini. I used a combination of mild cheddar and mozzarella cheeses, plus I substituted a clove of crushed garlic for the garlic powder & added about a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce. Makes a really good midweek vegetarian meal with a salad.

This was okay. There are many good reviews so I must have done something wrong. Maybe it was the bread I used which was a regular loaf of white bread. I toasted it like some suggested. It was just kinda dry and bland.....eh. Oh well. I'll try different bread next time. Thank you for posting!

No substitutions it was exactly as the recipe called for. I was a little unsure but my son who never eat anything healthy sucked it down. It was a win-win and I will be making us again.

Excellent...my husband and I both loved this.  I did add extra cheese to the mix and plenty on top also.  The fresh zucchini from the garden was enhanced in this dish....not hidden.

I WILL be baking it again.

I will definitely be making this again and again throughout the summer. I followed the recipe almost exactly today.  The only thing I changed was I toasted the bread first after reading the reviews, and I cooked it in my convection oven. It would be very good in an omelette.

I just don't keep bread around so I used 2 pkgs. of seasoned croutons and splashed a little half and half into the bowl, to moisten the cubes.  My go to recipe for zucchini or yellow squash!  So good.

This wasn't bad. It was very easy. I forgot the garlic salt but even without it the cheese had enough and it is lower sodium without it. I'll probably do this again. And - it does need the whole hour of cooking time. 1/2 uncovered and 1/2 covered.

After reading a bunch of reviews, I sauteed my onion and toasted the bread. It tasted good and the church crowd ate it up, but it did not taste like zucchini. More like a crunchy, cheesy bread with little bites of squash here and there.

I didn't have mozzarella cheese so I used grated pepper jack instead. Also there was no need to brown the sausage, like a lot of recipes call for. 
I would definitely make this again.

We liked this.  I used asiago cheese bread which I toasted and cubed and I thought really added to the flavor.  I didn't feel like 2 cups of zucchini was enough.  Would use more next time.  Also thought the zucchini was a little overcooked and mushy.  Might try cooking it less time next time

It was ok. Pretty simple recipe without many ingredients, but it would make a great "blank slate" to personalize your own version of a zucchini casserole. I can imagine people having a lot of fun adding their own ingredients and tweaking this recipe to their liking. But as it is, it's just ok. Bread, zucchini, onion, cheese. That's the flavors you get. Only thing I did different was toast the bread a bit before cubing it, at the suggestion of another review. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and it made plenty for my husband and I to eat with a little bit of leftovers.

The rating is for the original recipe.  Luckily I followed some of the fellow reviewer’s suggestions, such as mixing half of the cheese in (rather than just topping it with cheese), adding an additional egg, and baking it in a 8 x 8 inch pan.  I also used garlic powder and salt and added black pepper, ground mustard and ground nutmeg.  I may or may not make this again…

Loved it...a lil too much onion so I halved the amount(we aren't big onion eaters, but ours are homegrown, making them way more potent)...added more cheese and mixed it inside as well as topped. I added some extra sharp cheese and a sprinkle of fresh parmesan for a tang....loved it! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Really good. Only change was sauteing the onion and zucchini in a pan before baking and then only baking for the 2nd 30 minutes. A little bit faster and might avoid the sogginess that others have mentioned.

Would definitely parboil the zucchini before assembling when I make it again, to see if that makes it moister. Did use the ends of my whole wheat bread cubed and that made the dish.

We have been looking for easy recipes to get out 18month old to eat something besides grilled cheese and yogurt and this was a hit! We will definitely be making it again. Used French bread, omitted the onions, and added minced garlic salt and pepper  and it was perfect

I made this exactly to the recipe but, although my husband and I both love our home grown squash and zuchnini,  we did not like this at all.  Really not sure what the bread was supposed to add to the recipe.  I will not be making this again.

Really good! Made a couple changes though, added 1 tsp of Creole seasoning and used 1 tsp. bottled minced garlic instead of garlic salt. Next time I will use two eggs for a better binder. Mixed some cheese in with zucchini too. Super good! Thanks for the new idea!

Raw onion flavour swamped the dish. Should have fried the onions first. It really needed more spices, at the very least salt and pepper. I added 2 eggs+ milk+ water rather than 1 egg, and even still the consistency was too lumpy for my liking. Perhaps chopping the zucchini more finely would have helped, but then the key ingredient would be unnoticeable.
One good thing: lightly toasted bread lumps  cheesy flavour.

Sounds great, but my market doesn't sell zucchini by the cup, so it would be helpful to 
translate it to pounds.

This was great! I added yellow summer squash & used italian bread crumbs instead of bread and it was fine. I did season more since my family is used to well seasoned dishes & it came out perfect. I would definitely make again. I am trying to work out a way to add chicken breast on top to make a 1 dish meal. I will post if it comes out well.

Delicious despite my mistake of mixing the cheese in with the egg,onion & spices.  Next time I'll remember to put the cheese on top and it won't dry out. I added little slices of tomato from the garden and increased the egg to 2.

It was good. The hubs loved it. I added some cajun seasoning on top just because I thought it could use a little extra spice. Will be making it again, probably will add sausage for a bit more substance. It was a little flat.

I am not a great cook, but I had some zucchini to use and this sounded good.  It WAS!  My 17-year old said he wanted to have the leftovers the next day but there weren't any!  I made it exactly as directed except I had shredded zucchini so I used that instead of cubing.  Also, I found the 9x13 pan to be too big.  Would use an 8x8 next time.  We will definitely make this again.

This was very tasty!  I did decrease the cooking time after reading some of the comments.  I cooked it for 30 minutes covered, then 15 to 20 minutes uncovered, which was plenty.  As much as I love cheese, this was almost too much cheese in relation to the zucchini, so next time I make it, I will use around 3 cups of zucchini.   I did mix most of the cheese into the dish, sprinkling the rest of it on top.

This was good as written although I did throw in a can of chicken. However, it did have problems. The cooking time was right but the cheese should only be uncovered for 10 -15 minutes. Otherwise it is way too hard. Also this should be cooked in a 8 x 8 pan. Spread out into a 9 x 13 it was way too thin. Good flavor however.

This was okay. Not great, but not bad either. I think stuffing would have been better than the little bit of bread. I also had to double the cheese, mixing some in with the zucchini mixture. It had a good taste, but it was very "vegetable" tasting. If you're looking to hide the veggies, this is not the recipe for you. There is another zucchini casserole on this site, I think its called "Chicken Zucchini Casserole"- it is MUCH better.

Very Good!  I made this because I had zucchini and didn't know what to do with it. I thought my kids would eat it, but they won't.   I don't feel it's too healthy because of the bread and cheese.  Seems more like a holiday side dish if I were splurging.  It tastes like stuffing with zucchini in it.  I used seasoned salt & garlic powder since I don't have garlic salt.  I also used rosemary parmessian bread which was really tasty. I could probably eat the entire thing. It's good!

Not too crazy about this.  I feel like the garlic needed to be halved and it needed some salt and pepper maybe some italian seasoning too.  More than likely will not make again... sorry, just not my preference.

I like this recipe better than the ones made with cream soups. I used corn bread instead of my expensive whole grain bread (about equal ratio of bread to zucchini), 2 eggs and about 1/3 cup milk. I also added about 1 cup cheese to the mix and added the rest near the end of cooking. I cooked as directed in a 9x13 pan and it was really good. Some of the bread was crunchy, some of it soft.   I made it a 2nd time with white bread, mozerella cheese and italian seasonings in a smaller pan. The corn bread was far better according to the family. I might add some chopped tomato the next time.

5 stars with modifications. I toasted the bread a bit. I added minced garlic and seasoning salt. I would double the zucchini next time and add another egg.

5 stars with modifications. I toasted the bread a bit. I added minced garlic and seasoning salt. Mine cooked in HALF the time. Be careful. I would double the zucchini next time and add another egg.

Pretty good, but not fabulous. If I make this again I will add some herbs - maybe thyme, some lemon juice, and less cheese and butter for a healthier dish. Thanks!

Try using toasted Panera's Tomato Basil bread for xtra flavor. Also, added 1/2t of Penseys Aleppo Pepper, 1/2t of Pensey's Italian seasoning and a few turns of freshly ground black pepper. I divided the cheese by putting 1/2 into the zucchini/onion mixture and the other half on the top. Put in a 11x7 baking dish. I kept it covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 15. Very yummy!

This was very yummy.  I baked into a 9x9 pan - which was all I had  available.  The next time I will cube my zucchini into smaller pieces or perhaps shred.  This is a keeper...thanks for sharing!

This was a yummy recipe. It was a little bland, but I added some Parmesan cheese on top as well as some cracked pepper and everybody was asking for the recipe. I thought it worked better in a smaller pan too, but the cook time was right on. Everybody loved the crunchy top. Oh and I toasted the bread first and it wasn't mushy at all! Thanks!

My husband has raved about this recipe for weeks, Great way to use up Zucchini from the garden. I folled the recomendations for adding Season salt, and I used Green onions (Just what I had on hand). And I added 2 eggs. Very fluffy, and just a good dish. I served with a side of baccon for a nice summer dish.

I made this dish last night and I will not be making it again.  The time to cook this recipe is way to long.  The cheese ended up being burnt at the top and the entire dish had very little taste to it.  I was disappointed cause I love zucchini.

OK, as usual I cheated.  Took this idea and made it my own.  Was in a hurry (as usual) sauted the cubed zucchini added the spices and melted the cheese on top. If I ever have the time I will try it as written.  I'm sure not to run out of zucchini anytime soon. Wasn't bad my way...Can't wait to try it again. Great idea!

I use 2 cups of store-bought croutons (thanks, "Mrs. Cubbison"!) and half an onion instead of a whole one. One of my favorite recipes for a side dish...my vegetarian friend uses it when her relatives come over, since it's something they both enjoy. I've used yellow summer squash too...a little different taste, but still yummy!

Not a bad recipe!  I used saltine crackers in place of the bread - makes it more like an escalloped corn recipe.  You can always add another egg or two. I also use onion granules and veggie pepper (from Frontier Herbs) because of personal preference. YUMMY!!

This was a very good way for me to use my abundant supply of zucchini.  It was very flavorful.  Have made it two days in a row.  It is a very easy to make recipe.  The only thing I did different was to add black pepper to the recipe.

Never having made Zuccini before I was more then a little nervous when I was given several Zucchini. Fearing I would waste them I rushed here & found this recipe...I had everything I needed in the kitchen cooked it up using day old french bread and oh my goodness my family of 7 were suprised and delighted! DEFINATELY making again!

i think this will be a 5 star recipe in our household, with a few modifications.  i used sour dough bread, and i'd recommend not because i think it takes away from the zucchini. 1 tsp. of garlic salt is too much...just sprinkle a little on.  and after i uncovered the dish for the last 30 minutes, it turned hard.  so next time i'd leave the foil on and put it in a smaller dish.  but i am definitely going to try this recipe again.  thank you.

I really liked it, others didn't so much. It's an American influenced taste, though.. we're used to stuffing at Thanksgiving. To others, it tastes like stale bread. Flavors were delicious!

I loved this recipie. I needed a new zucchini recipie and I found this one today and had all the ingredients and an hour later it was done. I put a little too much garlic salt (but that was my fault) and excluded the onions because I didn't have any on hand. It turned out really good and my husband and mother loved it. My mother said it was the best thing I have cooked in a while. It smelled so yummy while it was cooking. i couldn't wait to eat it.  I will cook this again, probably next week.

FANTASTIC! GREAT way to eat your veggies. Simple to make & just deee-lish! I didn't have cheddar cheese, so I used Italian blend shredded cheese...which was awesome, too. Thanks for the recipe!

I give this 3 stars.  It wasn't at all bad, and was good enough that we finished it off, but not quite good enough that I'd make it again.

I followed the recipe exact, except I substituted mozzarella for the cheddar.  It was good but the onion was overpowering.  And I really like onions.  Next time I'll cut the onion in half and add a protein.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it tasted a little odd. Someone said too greasy, another too salty, and I can see both of those. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either.

This was a fairly bland casserole.  There's so much more that can be done to enhance the flavor of zucchini.  This one fell a little flat.

This was excellent.  This was about 2 servings as a main course, maybe 4 as a side.  Also, I added halved mushrooms and omitted the butter all together.  Baked uncovered, the bread crisps just fine and was not soggy.  Thank You! Thank You.

I love this recipe and make it at least once a week.. i omit the butter for health reasons and if im feeling lazy instead of the first half hour in the oven....i zap it in the microwave without the cheese for 6 minutes. Some people like it their bread reallly crunchy others dont, so play around with cooking times until you figure out what suits you best.

This was excellent!  I also toasted the bread like other reviewers suggested.  My husband loved it also.  I will definitley make again.  Altough, I may try making it in a 8x8 pan next time, so it was a little thicker.

This dish received really mixed reviews in my household. I may try it again with seasoned croutons or perhaps stuffing mix. Not bad, but we felt it was bland.

This is a great recipe.  My husband is not a fan of zucchini.  However, when I made this dish, he went back for a second helping.  Very delicious!

This was the first time we tried zucchini in something other than bread or cake. We really liked it! It was a bit crunchy, so we doubled it the next time and liked it even better!

WANT TO MAKE THIS QUICKER?  If you have a convection oven, just bake uncovered for 25 mintues - and it's done!  Also, I used 1/2 onion, 2 T real garlic, 2 eggs, and 1.5 c cheese, and added some salt.  EXCELLENT!!!!  Will make again!

This was amazing!!!!  The dish has a wonderful cheese and garlic taste but doesn't distract from the wonderful natural taste of the zucchini.  This is a keeper!!!

This is a great, yummy recipe! I added an extra egg because I had a little more zucchini than the recipe called for, and I also tossed in some Italian bread crumbs. Next time I think I will also finely chop or shred the zucchini, just a personal preference of mine. Overall, a delicious side-dish!

Thought this was pretty good. I toasted two pieces of wheat bread and 4 small pieces of french bread.  I think the wheat wasn't right for the dish.  I used more zucchini than called for but left everything else the same.  Husband liked it so it was at least approved by him!
