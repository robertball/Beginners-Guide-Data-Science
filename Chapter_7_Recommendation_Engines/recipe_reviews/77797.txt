I am only giving this four stars because the orginal recipe was too bland for my taste. I added a few things: one can each of corn, black beans, and green chilies, about 2 tsp each of cumin and corriander, about 2 tbsp orange juice concentrate, about 1 1/2 tbsp honey, 2 bay leaves, more salt, about 2 cups of tomato juice, about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for some heat. Of course, I did not add cheese or sour cream, but I beleive a dish should be able to stand on its own, with condiments only to enhance. This recipe is totally original, and I will definately make my version again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe to build on.  I added black beans, corn, cumin an extra can of tomatoes and extra chili powder.  My family loved it.

Definitely missing something...  3 stars as I had to tweak this recipe so much to achieve any flavor, however I loved the addition of the pumpkin!  Good base to build on for personal chili preferences.

I am always looking for new and different recipes, especially ones that incorporate veggies that you otherwise wouldn't eat a lot of, like pumpkin. 

I have made this a couple times and it is really good.  I say good, because I have had to tweak it a little to my taste. For example, it was too thick for me so I added some more tomatoes, including the liquid, and some chicken broth.  I also added some spices, like cumin, cilantro, and some more chili powder because it was a bit bland without it. 

All in all, it is very filling, but healthy meal that is not expensive or time consuming to make. Thanks.

I give this recipe 5 stars for the absolute genius of adding pumpkin to my chili!!!  Hubbie and I LOVED it.. he insists that I make it again soon!  However, the end-result was not b/c I followed the recipe exactly. Quite the contrary... I DID read the reviews thoroughly and used quite a few of them to make this top-notch chili a success!: 1) Add can of black beans, 2) Add can of corn, 3) Add 1 1/2 cans of diced tomatoes, 4)Add packet of taco seasoning, 5) Add 3x chili powder, 6) Add nearly a whole can of chicken broth (good for consistency and flavor), 7) Add 2 TBS worcestershire and 8) Add dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg to REALLY bring out the complexity of the pumpkin in this chili.  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks so much!

Great idea! I like my chili spicy so I only put in half the amount of pumpkin and added fresh cilantro, corn, jalapenos, and some extra cumin, cayenne pepper and chili powder. It was very tasty!

The base of the recipe was good - the pumpkin adds a nice rich flavor. However, I used the exact amount of seasoning recommended and I think it needs a little more spice.  I will definitely make this again because the ingredients are super healthy, but I will add more spice to it.

What do you do when you are saddled with dozens of jars of homecanned pumpkin (thanks, Mom!) and trying to watch your carbs?  Try one really bizarre recipe!  This one earns 5 stars for creativity.  I didn't make it exactly as printed, so I can't testify accurately for the taste.  However the idea alone was worthwhile.  I left out onion and peppers (not my family's favorites) and substituted envelopes of chicken chili dry mix for the seasoning.  It was VERY good.  We will be eatting lots of this chili this winter!

Found this recipe while scouring for ideas for a Halloween party.  I made a double batch and took it and it was devoured!  Amazing recipe that makes me feel really good about eating it!  Absoloutely delicious and I'm reccomending it to everyone I know who's trying to eat healthier while not sacrificing taste!

This is really good!  The pumpkin is subtle - it just adds a creaminess and sweetness that works really well.  Definitely will make this again.

I agree with the reviewer that the pumpkin had a subtle taste.  My husband was surprised when I told him about the "secret ingredient."  I also added a can of chicken broth as I like a more liquidy, soupy texture.

Being the first really cold and blustery day of fall this year, this was the perfect recipe to cook tonight.  It's easy, tasty and a powerhouse of nutrition.  It's got vitamins and antioxidants from the pumpkin, tomatoes and peppers and lean protein from the turkey.  I did take one star away because as written it is a bit bland.  I added seasoning and tasted as I went.  I ended up using 2 Tbsp. chili powder, 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper, 1 tsp. salt and a handful of chopped fresh cilantro.  I used a 15 oz. can of pumpkin (which is about 1/2 cup short of 2 cups) and added 1/2 cup chicken broth to make it a little less thick.  My husband is not a big fan of chili, but he really liked this recipe!

This is an awesome recipe, right up there with traditional chili made with ground beef.  Much healthier, too, with the use of leaner meat and the addition of pumpkin.  I have never been much of a ground turkey fan, but this recipe changed my mind--I couldn't tell the difference from ground beef.  The pumpkin is subtle and adds extra flavor, not to mention Vitamin A.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added canned kidney beans, frozen corn, and a small can of diced green chilies, all which helped to make the chili more substantial and filling.  I also followed the suggestions to add more spices, so I added cumin, cayenne pepper, and a few dashes of hot sauce.  A word of advice here--make sure you like your chili hot and spicy before you do this.  It was a little bit too spicy for my palate, although otherwise very delicious, but my husband and son thought it was just right.  So next time I probably will tone down the spices--just using chili powder would be fine for me.  I didn't use the Cheddar cheese or sour cream toppings, and I felt it really didn't need them, but I'm sure it would taste good if they were included.  I love collecting and making seasonal and holiday recipes, and this is definitely one that will be added to my fall recipe file.

Yummy!  Pumpkin is subtle, but nice touch.  To spice it up a little, added a dash of cayenne and few dashes of hot sauce.  Used all green pepper and added a can of pinto beans and 1C frozen corn to give it more body.  Delicious with the sour cream and cheese.

As weird as pumpkin in chili sounds, this is a delicious base recipe. I used fresh, cubed pumpkin and added some cumin, chicken stock (I cooked mine for a few hours... it needed some liquid) a can of tomato paste, some jalepenos for extra spice and a big can of pinto beans. Chili just isn't chili without beans to me. With those additions, I think this is one of the best chilis I've ever made. Thanks for the idea of adding pumpkin to chili, this will make an amazing halloween night meal!

I give 4 stars just because I, too, made changes based on other reviewers suggested and my family gave my revised version 5 stars!  I added a can of tomatoes with green chillies, a can of drained and rinsed black beans, some orange juice, a tablespoon of honey, extra salt, cumin powder, coriander powder, cinnamon, a bay leaf, 3 heaping tsp. of New Mexico chili powder which is milder than the regular kind and a little sweeter, and a handful of chopped fresh cilantro to simmer. I think the extra spices plus the honey, including the cinnamon and cilantro really added something to the pumpkin. I let it simmer an extra ten minutes which helped the flavours blend. It was delicious without any cheese but fantastic with it. Thanks! It's now our new favourite and the turkey is lighter on the stomach than beef. Serve with corn bread for a final touch.

This is so good!!  I used one green pepper instead of the mix, and subbed a jar of salsa for the tomatoes.  That seemed to fix the "bland" problem others wrote about.  I threw everything into the slow cooker and cooked on high 1 hour, low 5 hours, then served over spaghetti squash.  Super healthy and tasty meal, will definitely make this again!

Yum! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly (except for adding a little cumin) because I've never made chili before. It came out quite good. Next time I will use some fresh tomatoes instead of canned. It's very filling and can stand alone with cheese or sour cream. The pumpkin is subtle, but not completely lost!

This has become one of my go-to recipes.  So fast, delicious, and nutritious!!  I did make some changes to up the nutritional value, and keep it easy.  First, I don't use 2 types of bell pepper.  I just chop up one orange bell pepper and use the whole thing.  I also add one can of black beans, rinsed and drained, and frozen corn.  The combo of colors alone in this chili makes it appetizing, and then you taste it.  Yum!  I use the recipe seasonings, but I add a little cumin, and a little coriander, and sometimes a little cayenne for heat.  Play with the spices, but I highly recommend using cumin.  With all the veggies added in, I just serve this with cornbread.  Makes a great weeknight dinner, or weekend lunch.  Double the recipe and freeze some, too!  I even served this to a crowd at our pumpkin carving party.  Everyone raved, and then I told them it was made with pumpkin!!

I'd give it about 3.5 stars but it was more of a 4 on day two. The pumpkin was a bit overwhelming for my hubby and I added pumpkin pie spice as recommended by some reviewers and that was a mistake. There was too much cinnamon and stuff taking over the chili flavor. I'd try it again but not until after I try some other chili recipes on here.

This was very good - I threw in some red pepper, a can of black beans and a can of green chilis.  I thought it was a little bland.  Nextime I plan to add a jalepeno to spice it up.

I absolutely love this recipe. I make it often for dinner during the week; it is quick and easy to make after work and lasts for a few meals.  I just add a couple ingredients: corn, cilantro, crushed red pepper flakes and some hot sauce.  This is definitely a staple in my household!

I followed this recipe because anything that sounds unusual is automatically interesting to me. I don't agree that this is a true chili recipe, however it was very interesting and I am looking forward to playing around with different ingredients in the future. The Pumpkin puree makes for a great texture/consistency in the chili!

I made this with ground chicken and it turned out great.  Although my husband and I prefer more spice, this was the right amount to please our kids.  This is a keeper in our family!

I love the concept of this chili!  The pumpkin adds creaminess and tons of nutrition. I made the following changes to add some pizazz: 1 can of corn, 1 can of black beans, an additional can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, a cup of chicken broth, and a little cumin and onion salt. You can really add anything your heart desires, and it'll turn out delicious. Great with cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I feel like it is an excellent base recipe that is easily customizable to suit ANY taste.  I made a lot of changes to suit mine, and I was thrilled with the result.  The basic things you should take from this recipe are the canned pumpkin, ground turkey, onion, and the chili powder.  I added beans, more diced tomatoes, chicken broth, any veggies on hand, and about a tsp of cumin.  Still, the pumkin in the chili adds a nice texture, thickness, fiber, nutrients, and flavor.  It is a very tasty and healthy recipe!

I made this for a Halloween party and it was phenomenal! We left it simmering on the stove so people could just grab some if they wanted, perfect party dish. The pumpkin really added a ton of flavor and changed the "typical" chili taste. I highly recommend it! I added corn to mine as well.

Woah!! So amazing. I great way to incorporate pumpkin, it gives the chili an amazing creaminess. Didn’t follow the recipe exactly…I used what I had. I didn’t have any peppers but I did use onions, I added corn and beans as well. I also used a small can of tomato sauce instead of the crushed tomatoes. I also added cumin and more salt and pepper. I didn’t do the cheese and sour cream because it didn’t need it and to cut calories but it would have been awesome with the cheese and sour cream.

I LOVE this recipe, and make extra to freeze.  I omit the oil and cook the onion in the turkey juices (with real lean turkey, its mostly water).  I also add a can of pinto beans and some cumin and red pepper to spice it a bit more.  AWESOME!

This was a bit bland. I think it needed more tomatoes. It was really thick, so I added water. It also needed to simmer a lot longer.

This was so much better without the pumpkin puree.  I could do without.  Added a pinch of tumeric (no taste, just color an antioxidants).  Cinnamon pinch would work well here too.  Instead of ground turkey, I used shredded turkey or chicken.  Came out perfectly.  Also reduced chili powder since all my kids can not tolerate spice.  Added some cannelini beans and /or sweet potato during my 2nd batch.  That was really interesting.

Surprisingly really delicious.  The pumpkin takes the place of tomato sauce.  The pumpkin gives the chili a thick consistency.  I did add cumin & a little more chili powder, other than that I made it exactly like the recipe.  Next time I make it, I want to add beans.

We tried this recipe as written which was good; the add on's by the other reviewer made it great! Added 1 can of corn, 1 can of black beans, Cummin & Coriander, and Tomato Juice.  The pumpkin gave the chili a heartiness to it I would of never expected.  It won first place for a chili cook off; Thanks for the recipe!

This is a nice base for a chili, but I can't say I was impressed at all before I threw open the spice cabinet and went to town. I have no measurements to share, but I ended up adding a bunch of chili powder, cumin, cayenne, salt, pepper, and a jalapeno pepper until it was up to my tastes. I couldn't believe that there was no liquid to this chili! I didn't have chicken stock (which probably would have been better - or turkey stock, if you get it in season) so I added about 3 cups of water to be able to allow it to properly simmer. I put a can of cannellini beans (drained) into it as well.  I do like the end result, and the idea of this chili, but I'm unimpressed with the original recipe. Sorry. :(

Delicious! I did change some things to accomodate our tastes, but this is a great recipe. I omitted the onion and bell peppers, replaced the diced tomatoes with 2 cans of Rotel, added a can of corn, a can of fat free chicken broth, and a tablespoon of cumin. I also added a can of red beans, as we love beans in our chili. The cumin took away most of the pumpkin flavor, but that was fine by me. I was just happy to have incorporated such a healthy food into the dish. Thank you so much, I will be making this often this winter.

Delicious and easy, though I usually increase the spicing. Simple to make vegan, too; just replace the turkey with about two cans of pinto beans.

Thank you for this great recipe! My husband and I are doing the 17 Day Diet, and this is better (and even healthier!) than the recipe from Dr. Moreno's book. My husband hasn't tried it yet, but I think I will not tell him about the pumpkin until he has tasted it. It's wonderfully decadent-tasting without the guilt. I made a few changes, used jalapeno instead of bell pepper because we like hot stuff. I also added a small can of tomato paste to give it a richer color and taste, and used Rotel tomatoes with green chile instead of regular tomatoes. I would make this again even if I wasn't on a diet!

We loved this but it required several additions. I  added another can of diced tomatoes, about a cup & half of low-sodium, organic chicken broth, a can of rinsed black beans & a can of corn, drained. I also added cayenne & cumin & just a pinch of pumpkin pie spice. I was out of bell peppers so I subbed roasted red peppers from a jar. Hubby was very skeptical but raved about this dish. Served it w/ rolls & it tasted so good, I forgot to top our bowls w/ sour cream & cheese. Oh well, we certainly didn't need the calories anyway. ;o)

Really like the idea of pumpkin in this chili. It gave it a nice texture and upped the nutritional value.  I did add more traditional chili spices as it was really bland with the listed measure of spices in the recipe.  We like our chili spicy.  Is a great recipe to start with and tweak it to suit your own tastes. Thanks for a great recipe. Will do again.

Stunningly wonderful.  I had to add chicken broth to make it a consistency that we love for our chili.  Without the broth it could have been eaten with a fork!  I used garden tomatoes instead of canned and I added 2 cans of diced green chilis to suit our family taste.  Will definitely make this a regular winter meal at our house.  It's a superfood extravaganza!

Great soup! I wasn't too sure about the pumpkin in the soup, but it was great! Per reviews, I increased spices and used 2 cans of diced tomato (w/ green chilies) and 3 cans of water. Without the extra tomato and water, it is not soup consistency at all. It was way too thick. I piled on the spices too, using extra chili powder & garlic, added cumin, turmeric, ginger, bay leaves, cilantro, and a splash of OJ. With the changes it was a 5 star recipe. Would have been a rather bland mush otherwise. Great base recipe to alter however you want!

I just made this. It was good after I added extra chili powder. I'm going to make it again but double the tomatoes and cut the pumpkin amount in half. I would add the frozen corn also.

This recipe is a great base recipe to play around with and tweak to your own tastes. I made some changes and additions and came up with something great that I featured on my blog. Very creative use of pumpkin.

So tasty... and pumpkin is SO good for you!!!  I modified as well.  I made it a bit sweeter and added curry too, using a sweet curry spice mixture.  I added beans I had leftover (pinto, black, even black-eyed), and some bulger (from taboulli).  What a healthy, filling meal!!!  Enjoy.

I loved this soup. I've made it at least three times for guests and handed the recipe out four times. Everyone who has it loves it. Even the kiddos.   I did add some spice to it. I added another couple cloves of fresh minced garlic, a pinch of cayenne pepper, a couple tablespoons of cumin, and added a few cups of chicken broth. I also put frozen corn in it since I had it on hand. I served it with fresh cilantro, red onion, and salsa. It was GOOOD!

My new favorite chili!  I made this pretty much as-is with a couple recommendations from reviewers and the family loved it - including my 3 and 8 year olds!  I didn't tell them there was pumpkin in it until we were half way through and they were all surprised.  No one could tell the secret ingredient.  I added an extra can of tomatoes and a can of black beans along with double the chili powder and about a half teaspoon each cumin and ground chipotle pepper.  The pumpkin makes the chili very thick with wonderful body and texture.  We topped it with crushed up corn chips, shredded cheese, a small dollop of sour cream and a couple shakes of chipotle tabasco.  I love that it's super healthy (without the toppings we added) and a great way to get vitamins in your kids.  Next time I'll add a second can of black beans.  It's definitely going in the recipe box!

Great base recipe but I added a lot to this.  Cumin, apple cider (the alcohol kind), honey (I found it very bitter), an extra can of tomatoes (I also used fresh).  I used black beans instead of turkey.  Really good with changes.  Will make again.

I’m going with a 5 for creativity and nutrition.   I like to make the recipe as written the first time I make it, if I mix it up I don’t feel that it is fair to rate it.  I made this just as the recipe states.  It is the perfect consistency for chili.   The flavors are an interesting tasteful blend and the level of seasoning is perfect for a mixed group; everyone can enjoy it and those who want more kick can spice up their bowl.  Next time I probably will add more seasoning and play around with other additions to match our personal preferences.  I provide meals for my parents and am always trying to figure out how to bump up the nutrition, this one it pretty good although I’m thinking of trying it with low sodium tomatoes.

This recipe turned out pretty well, but I read the reviews and added chicken stock as noted... It took about 2 cups to get it to the proper consistency. Definitely needed more spices that the recipe called for as everyone else has been saying too... But the pumpkin can't be tasted and it was a great way to get my boyfriend to try new foods! Would definitely make again!

I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving, added both broth, and tomato sauce to thin this thick chili; added more chili powder, some cumin, cayenne and garlic powder before it was the spiciness and consistence I wanted.

A delicious, easy recipe. The pumpkin gave it a nice flavor! My roommates loved it too. I added a can of red kidney beans and a can of white beans (including the liquid), which made it a little more hearty. I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the diced (bought the wrong kind). Also, I skipped the cheese and sour cream on top- trying to be hearthy in the new year! It made quite a bit, so next time I will freeze small portions for a quick lunch or dinner. Tastes great with Cheez-its thrown in!

I made this with leftover turkey and pumpkin puree from thanksgiving dinner (in canada, eh).  The texture and flavour of the turkey breast in the chili was amazing - am sure it would also be good with the ground turkey.  Overall, the recipe is really great, although I added twice as many crushed tomatoes.  The sour cream and cheddar cheese served on top are essential.  This will become a favorite after thanksgiving recipe for me :)

I knew when I read this recipe that it would be really good. I followed the recipe plus I added the cumin, coriander, black beans, corn, extra salt, peppers, Bay leaves and chili flakes.. Orange juice sounded like a good idea but I didn't have any. So I added pineapple juice. It was interesting how the citrusy pineapple juice brightened up the flavors. I also added some water  for consistency. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I have always been a big pumpkin fan and a big chili fan, so I thought why not put the two together.  After finding this recipe I fell in love.  I decided to find many other recipes like this and make my own version.  However, the idea of pumpkin and the gentle taste of turkey was a perfect combination.  I spruced this recipe up a bit though:  I added 3 slices of bacon, extra pumpkin puree, extra chili powder, cumin, smoked chipotle chile powder and allspice (I wish I had some Pumpkin Pie spice to add).  The recipe was phenomenal with cheddar cheese, just flows so nicely with the turkey and bacon.  I would make it with more of a pumpkin flavor if I make it again.  I am giving this a four because it needed to be tweaked to make it taste like a authentic chili but make you say "Hey I think there is pumpkin in this!" lol

Awesome!! I definitely will make this again. This is a great healthy version of chili. The only change is that a used orange bell peppers instead of green. Not a fan of the green pepper. Also I had some black beans left over so I put that in the chili too. So delicious!!!!

5 stars I made this yesterday and served it to guests, everyone wants the recipe, it is delish.  I didn't have turkey so I used roughly chopped skinless thighs.  I added a can of chicken broth, didin't serve cheese or sour cream, just a bowl of chopped cilantro.  I added a little thyme and cumin.

Nice--took recommendations from other reviewers. Added a can of drained, rinsed black beans, corn, and a 8 oz. can of tomato sauce because the chili was too thick and I was afraid it would scorch. Also added a half tsp. of cayenne, 1 tsp. cumin, and 1/2 tsp. coriander. Just used red bell pepper because that's what I had, and 20 oz. of ground turkey breast.

Great thick chili recipe! I added 1 can of black beans rinsed, 1 can of corn, and 1 tsp of cumin. I threw everything into the crockpot on low for 6 hours and it was delicious! Be sure to cook the ground trukey prior to throwing into the crockpot though.

I wouldn't have thought of this combination -- the pumpkin makes a great thickener to this chili.  I liked it so much I made it twice in a month.  Since I prefer my chili extra spicy, I added cayenne pepper to the mix instead of red pepper flakes.  Yum!

Great base with the pumpkin.  Needed doctored though. I used leftover T-day turkey, skipped the peppers, added extra can tomatoes, can drained black beans, can veggie stock, frozen corn, 3-4x the chili powder, dash or 2 of hot sauce, a few jalapenos pepper slices, and cumin.  Delicious!! and spicy!

Great Recipe! Took me a few times to get it perfect for my husband and I but, now it is a favorite. I added black beans, corn and a little more garlic. I will be making this more often!

It didn't taste like chili.  I think that number 1, ground turkey was a bad idea; the texture was just awful.  Shredded turkey or chicken might have tasted better.  Number 2, it didn't have enough tomatoes to make it taste like chili.  I ended up giving the leftovers to my dog.

Ok . . Ok. . . I know the basis for rating a recipe should be more about what the overall dish is - but I have to say it is the overall idea that I thought was incredible.  We had a Chili cook off and I wanted something different.  If I had not read some of the other comments to spice this up, I know it would not have been as good BUT I was so impressed with the originality of the tastes that I have to give it a minimum of 4 stars.   The key ingredients that I liked were Chipolte peppers (with the adobo sauce), cayanne peppers, and a touch of nutmeg .

Amazing chili recipe!!  Like many others who reviewed this, I felt it needed more heat, so I used 5T chili powder, 3T cayenne pepper, and 1/2 cup habanero peppers.  I served with plain yogurt in place of sour cream.  Delicious!

This was surprisingly good.  The pumpkin does give a more creamy texture without giving the dish a pumpkin taste.  I did add additional cumin, garlic salt and chili powder, tomatoes with green chiles and a can of black beans.  I sauteed peppers and onions and browned the ground turkey and put all in the crockpot for the day on low.  It was delicious!

This was a delicious surprise!  My changes: no bell pepper, 2 cans of rotel (drained), 1 can each of kidney beans and black beans (rinsed and drained), 1 can of corn, 3 cans of low sodium chicken broth, and used 2 cups of pumpkin pie pumpkin puree rather than just pumpkin puree.  Also added more seasoning like cumin, chili powder and cayenne pepper.  The contrast of the cinnamon sweet flavor with the spice was wonderful!  Can't wait to have the leftovers!

Great recipe starter. I omitted the bell peppers and added corn, black beans, and picante sauce. Instead of pumpkin puree, I used a 29oz can of solid pumpkin. Delicious!

This recipe is simply amazing! I added corn and used only one can of pumpkin puree, but other than that I followed it as stated. It was wonderful. It was easy to make, and all of the flavours went so well together (I highly recommend adding corn- I put it in with the pumpkin and tomatoes). I'm looking forward to the leftovers! I will be making this many times.

The chili is a great idea but needs alot of work. It is way too bland. I added more chili powder and smoked paprika. And what is chili without cumin? I also added a jalapeno, oregano, corn, and a can of black beans. I love that this recipe has the two cups of pumpkin in it. Its flavor is very subtle. Most people probably won't even know its there. But it makes it too thick. So I added a whole can of chicken broth. I swapped out the canned tomatoes for the fire-roasted tomatoes. After all my changes I am proud to say it is much closer to a five now.

I gave this 4 stars because the recipe "as is" is WAY too bland for 5 stars.  You can make this 5 stars by adding spices, but you'll need to be comfortable throwing in a "little of this and a little of that".  I added chili powder, cumin, beer, black beans, corn, chopped jalepeno, 2 T of jalepeno juice from jar (this is vinegar based, but spicy) 1 T of liquid smoke, 1 beer, 2 T sugar, 2 T of taco seasoning, etc...  As you can see, my addition list is long.  It was REALLY yummy after all the doctoring.  We've made several recipes on this site and the chili recipe with Zuchini (sp?) is our favorite.

Like many I found this recipe a good base to add to. More
chili powder, red beans and cumin woke it up a bit. It is nice to serve to folks who may not eat beef or don't like their chili very spicy. It was liked by everyone who ate it. No one guessed that there was pumpkin in it!

We loved this.  My family was making faces when I said I was going to make this and then they couldn't stop talking about how good it tasted!  I will double this the next time.  The only change I made was to add a little (1 tsp) chicken soup base to it. The chili powder and the pumpkin compliment each other so well!  All my coworkers asked for the recipe because I wouldn't stop talking about it.  Thanks!

As many other users did, I added the following:

*About 2-3 cups chicken broth (still thick, but nice)
*Twice as much diced tomatoes, with juice
*A packet of McCormick's chili seasoning
*A can of kidney beans, drained and rinsed
*A can of corn, drained

It was EXCELLENT!!!  Very easy to make, too--the hardest part was chopping the peppers.  My husband isn't a huge fan of chili, but downed it and had seconds.  My sister-in-law not only asked for the recipe, she asked for the link to this site so she could find more like it!  This was also excellent heated up as leftovers.

I made this with Pillsbury Crescent Rolls, since I had them on hand, but would probably use corn bread instead next time.  That would be a perfect match.

This recipe is great if you make a few changes.  Add more tomatoes, cumin, cilantro, cayenne and salt.  The spices are to give it more taste and the tomatoes make it more liquid.  One small can was enough.  Since the recipe name probably would turn some people off, I changed it to "Fall Festival Chili".  Using it, I won a chili cookoff with 20 other entrants.  Thanks.

Without adding a lot of salsa or other seasonings, this is pretty bland. By the time we made our additions, we didn't even taste the pumpkin or anything else that made this unique. On a positive note, our infant son ate it after it was pureed! We probably won't be making this again, though.

This is now my go-to chili recipe, but I do have to add things to it for flavor, thus why it only gets 4 stars for as it is written. I add a can of beans, garlic powder, corn, and triple the amount of chili powder. I love that its hearty and healthy.

This was such a delicious recipe! Kudos to the author!  I made some alterations per comments. I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes and and doubled the amount. I added one can black beans, one cup turkey stock, and one cup shredded carrots (which added a veggie without changing the taste). Instead of ground turkey, I used leftover turkey/pork sausage I had on hand, and this made it REALLY tasty. For spices, I used 1.5 tbsp red cayenne pepper instead of chili powder, .5 tsp black pepper, 2 tbsp cumin & coriander, 2 bay leaves, 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg. Served over baked sweet potato with a sprinkling of mexican cheese mix. SO GOOD.

I was very curious to try this because the pumpkin addition sounded really unusual. I really enjoyed it and was surprised how well the flavors blended. I would recommend this if you want to try something out of the ordinary.

Pretty good, but a little too mild for us - needed lots more seasoning.  That's why I gave it a 4.  If you add more seasoning, it'd get a 5.  Very easy.
I tried to follow the directions exactly, except I used about 15 ounces of Mild Rotel instead of diced tomatoes.  I don't like tomatoes chunks, so I blended it before adding it.  I also immediately added about 5 cloves garlic because we like it.  And, I semi-blended the peppers and onions so the flavor permeated the turkey well, since my husband doesn't like turkey.  
When it was done, I felt it was too mild.  So, I added a lot more chili powder, pepper, cumin, coriander, and a touch of red pepper.  Plus I added more salt.
My husband actually liked it!  A first for turkey.  We put it on tortillas and topped it with a lettuce mix, kale, pepper jack cheese or cheddar cheese, and avacado.
We will definitely make this again.  I love it that the pumpkin adds nutrients and fiber.  We plan to make it and dehydrate it to use on a backpacking trip.  Tortillas travel well, as does hard cheese.  So, this will be good!  I will try it with lime on the leftovers.
Plan to also try substituting beans for the turkey to accommodate our vegetarian friends and our desire to eat less meat.  May also just add beans and kale or spinach to make the kind of chili we usually have with crackers.  And, I will probably use medium Rotel next time for more spice.

I don't usually like chili but this was really good.  Kind of wish it had beans just for extra nutrition but I think it would taste funny.  I used beef b/c the store was out of turkey.

Not much taste.  I'm going to modify this by adding chili seasoning, not just powder, and I would add mushrooms.  Don't think it needs sour cream, but cheddar cheese is a must.

I believe I enjoyed this recipe more than husband did. He found it bland so perhaps I will adjust the seasoning next time and also try using ground chicken for more flavor. It is a great way to use up leftover canned pumpkin.

absolutely delicious! I added a touch of orange juice to make it a bit sweeter, and cayenne pepper to add spice. my turkey had italian seasoning which was a really nice touch. I didn't think it needed sour cream or cheese even. Will definitely make again!

We were blown away! Pumpkin is a well-kept secret! I served this chili to friends with fresh warm cornbread. We  had seconds and enjoyed leftovers! I doctored it up and these simple additions made it taste like a gourmet recipe and gave it the depth of flavor I was hoping for:  I added 2 cans White Beans drained and rinsed, 1 cup low sodium chicken broth, 1/2 smallest can tomato paste, 3 tsp "Better than Boullion", 1/2 can green chilies (not the hot kind--but smoky), a dash of allspice, 3 TBL Essence of Emeril, 1 TBL cumin, 2 TBL no salt spice blend (I love the Kirkland Costco brand organic 21 spice blend), and water to control the right thickness/thiness as it simmered.

I took other reviewers' advice and added extra spices and beans.  I also added a touch of chipotle paste and 1 small can of tomato sauce.  I used leftover fresh pumpkin from Halloween that I baked and pureed as recommended by this site.  The chili came out DELICIOUS - the pumpkin adds a subtle sweetness and a warm orange color.

I was looking for healthy comfort food on a cold day.  Love this recipe!  I might add kidney beans next time to make it go further, but honestly, it really doesn't need it.  I NEVER would have thought to add pureed pumpkin.  What a great way to get your kids to eat veggies.  I will definitely serve this recipe again and again.

I was looking for a recipe to use my leftover pumpkin carvings in and this worked out great!  I just cubed and steamed the pumpkin.  You can mash it a little too.  I also added in some corn, green chilies, black beans with some cumin and paprika.  This turned out amazing and I will be making it again... in fact it may be my new Halloween pumpkin carving night tradition!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I won a potluck contest with it.  Tip- because my pallet prefers spicier I added a cup of spicey bloody mary mix! It was a hit~

I improvised a little on this recipe.  We both loved it and this is a definite "make-again."  I think one of the cool things about this recipe is that you really can make your own version, based on the outline this recipe provides.

Great recipe! I made a few changes though. Like many other reviewers, I added a can of black beans. I also found it to be a bit mild in spice, so I bumped up the amount of chilli powder and added some cayenne as well. Next time, however, instead of cayenne I will put in a real chilli pepper. Over all this is a great quick dinner! Thanks for posting!

This was fabulous!  I didn't switch it up much other than using leftover turkey from our Thanksgiving dinner and I also added homemade chicken broth so that it wasn't so thick.  I did saute the onions, green pepper, and some garlic in the pot before adding the remaining ingredients.  My husband said I can make this as much as I want to!  I guess that means that he enjoyed it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This wasn't for us. To be fair, unless the majority of reviews are not saying "its way too spicy", I know a recipe will be too bland for my husband and I.  But even with lots (LOTS) of tweaking the spice amounts this still did not pop.  Will not make again.  A tip though- for those who like more subtly flavored food- add some cinnamon, it draws out the pumpkin flavor. *****UPDATE**** I dumped a can of chipotle peppers in adobe sauce to the leftovers and the dish significantly improved; pumpkin still came through the heat.  Still wouldn't make it again, probably, but left-over night was a lot better than we were anticipating.

This is a really good spin on chili.  After reading reviews I did make some changes:  added one can of black beans and one can of corn, more chili powder, some cayenne pepper, cumin and coriander, and some chicken broth to make it less thick.  It was delicious and I will definitely be making it again!

5 stars for originality and 4 for taste and texture. It was WAY too thick and bland. I didn't want to rate the original recipe without trying it first, so I actually did everything as directed, tasted it and decided that a lot of things had to be added to make it really good. Add some liquid, without it this is so thick it is almost pasty. I added 1 (15oz) can of chicken broth. For flavor I ended up using 2 1/2 T chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, 1 (7 oz) can green chiles, 1 (15.5oz) can pinto beans and 3/4 t cayenne pepper. It wouldn't hurt to throw in some more garlic too, 1 clove is nothing! Well, after all the changes I love this chili. I can tell there is pumpkin in there though. Maybe if you don't mention it some people wouldn't be able to tell. So, if the kids don't like pumpkin...shhhh!!!

The original recipe is far too bland (and I'm a wuss when it comes to spice!)  I doubled the tomatoes pumpkin and chili pepper, added a can of garbanzo beans and a diced up sweet potato, bay leaf, maybe about a tsp or more of cumin and garam masala, about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon (to bring out the pumpkin) a bay leaf, and a nice Oktoberfest beer. I don't care much for really hot spicy, but for those who do you'll want to add chilies or maybe sriracha. Would probably be great with black beans instead or with the garbanzos as well.  I also omitted the sour cream and cheese - by the time I was done doctoring it, they weren't necessary and WOW my apartment smelled delicious!   I would 100% make this again - with my changes, of course.

My family loved it!  I'm rating it 5 starts because of the flavor and because it was so easy to make.  As others stated.. it's a great start and you can add whatever else to suit your taste.  We made it a little hotter and added different beans to it.

Good on its own - great with the sour cream or, as we did, yogurt, and cheese stirred in at table. Mind you, I made some changes: 29 ounce can diced toms, with water; no turkey; instead, added 19-ounce can kidney beans, drained and rinsed, to suit my fam's chili expectations...turned out great!

Please read the reviews before you set out to make this recipe! It's bland, and by bland I do not mean "un-spicy". I was able to salvage this meal, with the addition of many other ingredients too numerous to name here. I believe people may be rating this highly because they think they must've done something wrong! For my own reference: Next time just add pumpkin to your usual chili.

I have a pot on the stove as I type - and it is wonderful!  I took the other reviews into consideration and added a can of spicy chili beans for some extra kick.  I also added 1 cup chicken stock to make it a little thinner, a can of Ro-tel instead of the tomatoes, 1 T fresh apple cider and 1 T apple cider vinegar, about a cup of corn, and fresh cilantro.  As I made it, it's 5 stars for sure.  THANK YOU for inspiring me to try this unusual but delicious chili.

I love pumpkin, so I obviously had to try this recipe.  I read all the reviews before hand and decided to take some suggestions.  I used 3 cans of the diced tomatoes, 1 can of drained black beans, TB of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, cumin, & cayenne pepper.  I also added 2 TB of Brown Sugar and 1/2 cup Chicken Broth so it wasn't as thick - but still had a chili like consistency.  I garnished with a dollop of plain nonfat yogurt, chopped cilantro, reduced fat cheddar cheese, and served with Multi-grain Flaxseed Tortilla Chips on the side.  I loved it & so did my family.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is pretty good.  One thing I tried, given the pumpkin, was to stir in some cinnamon when serving - I keep reading about the use of cinnamon in savory dishes.  I think I like it better than I liked adding the sour cream and cheese!  Really delicious.

We really liked this recipe!  Only thing I did different was added a can of rinsed black beans.  Served it to guests and they never said anything about noticing something different about the chili and we never told them what was in it.  Will make again.  Great way to add a little more veggie to your chili!

Sooo good!  My husband, right before his second helping, told me this was the "most creative, most delicious" meal I'd ever made.  I made more of a soup, added about a cup and a half of chicken broth, some diced jalapenos, ground red pepper, some salt, garlic and onion powders, and a dash of cumin.  I didn't have diced tomatoes so I used about a 1/4 of a tomato I had left in the fridge, a little leftover tomato sauce, and an additional half cup of peppers.  Also added about a half cup of cheddar cheese to the soup itself.  WONDERFUL!

The recipe is a great base to start with.  I tasted it and agreed with other reviewers it needed more, so I added a can each of tomato sauce, corn, and black beans, as well as additional spices.  I will be making this for years to come!

If you really like pumpkin - this may be a 5 - but I did not enjoy the consistancy of the chili.  It was too grainy.  Flavor was good - but for whatever reason - the next day it didn't taste nearly as good (where normal chili is almost better the 2nd day).

This recipe was AMAZING! Though I didn't follow the original recipe. I read all the reviews and combined all the suggestions with what I had. The orange juice and honey recommedation was a great one, as was the cinnamon and nutmeg. I aslo added a can of tomatoes, a red bell pepper,carrots, corn, white kidney beans, sea salt and cumin, with cornbread muffins. It was healthy and surprisingly filling. This is a keeper!

The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because I modified the recipe quite a bit.  Like other commenters I added an extra can of tomatoes and I almost had to triple the amount of chili spice to give it some flavor.  My boyfriend, being a spice fiend, added a bunch of tobasco sauce as well, which gave it a great kick and tempered the sweetness.  I also used ground chuck instead of turkey, which gave it a richer flavore.  This is a great hearty chili though and I would highly recommend the recipe to anyone and everyone!

Amazing! Like other reviewers, I doubled the chili powder, added cumin and oregano, and doubled the tomatoes. I also added a half a beer and half a can of tomato sauce to increase the liquid.  I think this is the best chili I have ever had.

This was delicious - perfect over rice or pasta for the first day of fall weather. The pumpkin adds a great texture and a subtle flavor. I did add some cumin and coriander, along with the other spices BEFORE the tomatoes and pumpkin. I also decreased the chili to 1 T. for my 2 year old who INHALED this! Lastly, I subbed red bell peppers for green and added some celery and carrots. So I guess it was more like a stew, but it was sooooooooooo good!

This is really good! Like other users, I found it to be kinda thick & mushy.  So, I added about almost a cup broth(instead of water) and a can of garbanzo beans(drained & rinsed). I think that really helped the consistency.  I was going to add cumin & cinnamon, as others suggested,  but I didn't want to drown out the pumpkin flavor.  I figured if I was going to do that, why bother with the pumpkin.  I did use 1 tbsp chili powder, and 1/2 tbsp HOT chili powder, just cuz I like it a little spicier.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS RECIPE! It's the best chili I've ever made and better than any canned chili. I don't eat beef and I don't care for beans, so this recipe was my perfect match. You really can not taste the pumpkin (though I think that it would be really good if you could). I added things that other people recommended including extra spices (I love spicy chili so the more spice the better) and a can of chicken broth as it was just way too thick. I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was a good twist on my usual chili recipe. I will definately make it again. I did put the entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin in, though, sprinkled cinnamon and cumin---like a previous user, and added a 15 oz. can of kidney beans, undrained.

This is such a great recipe, especially for a cold winter night.  I also add a few things- more tomatoes (diced with mild green chiles,) cumin and a pinch or two of cinnamon.  You really can't taste the pumpkin but it adds a creamy dimension to the dish and is good for you too.  Can't go wrong with this one.

This was the best chili I or my family have ever had (and we have tried many different recipes)!  I am the only real pumpkin lover in my family, but it was my turn to cook and I decided to try this recipe.  I must admit that when I first added the pumpkin, the chili smelled wierd.  Once I added the chili powder, however, it smelled more like chili.  The only change I made was to throw in a can of kidney beans, since we love them in our chili.  The chili was neither too spicy nor too mild, in my opinion.  Just right!

Shame on me for not trusting the other 77 reviewers.  This recipe is good!  Pumpkin in chili... who knew?  I left out the green pepper and only used the yellow, because we're not big pepper fans.  I added a can of pinto beans and an extra can of tomatoes.  I also had to add some chicken broth because it was too thick for our taste, but that was the only problem I had.  I wouldn't tell my 10-year-old the name of the recipe before he tried it, for fear he and his sister wouldn't eat it.  I just said something vague like I couldn't really remember it, but that I'd find the name for him after dinner.  After he said he liked it and I told him the name, I said something like, "Does this teach you that you can't judge something by what you think you know about it?"  I was thinking I had hit on an easy teachable moment, but he said, "It teaches me if you can't remember the name of a recipe I should probably be afraid."  So either tell people what's in it beforehand or don't... either way you'll have to take responsibility for the decision to make chili with pumpkin in it. :)

This was a great recipe...with just a couple modifications as suggested by other reviewers.  I added an additional can of stewed tomatoes w/ green chilies, one 12oz can of tomato juice, doubled the chili pepper, 2 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp cayenne, can of corn and can of black beans (rinsed). With these additions the chili is so colorful...it just look great in a bowl!!  The pumpkin gave it that extra little sweetness and smoothed it out some. My husband and son had no clue what the "secret" ingredient was!!  It's so nice to find a yummy and healthy recipe!!  Thank  you!

I really loved this chili!  It tasted just like other chilis but with this neat undercurrent of the pumpkin flavor.  I don't like green peppers so I just used yellow and orange, I added more tomatoes, added corn, added black beans.  I could still taste everything...very fresh flavor.  I'll make this again for my brother who is a real "soup nazi" and didn't think the pumpkin would work.  We'll show him!

Like other reviewers, I think this is a 4-star base for a 5 star recipe. It does come out a little bland as written, however with a few additions it becomes a 5 star dish. I added corn and black beans + 1 small can of tomato sauce. Also, I used 1 15 oz can of pumpkin puree (instead of the 16 oz that is called for). Then I added salt, corriander, pumpkin pie spice, extra chili powder and salt to taste. Topped with a very sharp cheddar. Excellent!

This was great after I followed a few suggestions by others. I added corn, black beans, extra chili powder, cumin, cilantro, and coriander. I wish I would have had an extra can of tomatoes to add so I'll have to try that next time.

It's a good start but it definitely needed something added to it. I always assume when I see a highly rated recipe that people are actually rating this recipe not there amended version but I've come to realize that's not true. Next time I make this I will add corn and black beans, nutmeg and chicken broth.

this was great, like everyone said a good "start"  i doubled the chili, added navy beans, used red and yellow peppers and added sweet corn, plus used the whole can of pumpkin.  It was very satisfying.  I also added red pepper flakes.   Still ended up being a very subtle, yet spicy sweet turkey chili, very enjoyable.  the cheddar cheese on top was suprisingly good too.

THIS WAS AWESOME, just what we were looking for on a cold day. We added black beans and corn, cuz it's not a chili until it has beans!

We followed some other recommendations: "one can each of corn, black beans, and green chilies, about 2 tsp each of cumin and corriander, about 2 tbsp orange juice concentrate, about 1 1/2 tbsp honey, 2 bay leaves, more salt, about 2 cups of tomato juice, about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for some heat. "

This was tasty.  The pumpkin seems to give it a thickness that is really interesting and different.  Worth giving it a try.

In the end I really did like this/is a keeper but gets a 3 because I made so many changes from the original. I give a 5 for perfect as is, 4 for minor changes, 3 for lots of changes.Used a red pepper just because that is what I had on hand/that does not really affect the flavor much though. The spices are another story: as is this is bland and tastes too much like just pumpkin.I doubled the garlic (2 cloves), increased pinch of salt to 1/2 tsp and added 1/4tsp of red pepper flakes and 1 1/2 tsp of cumin. Pumpkin and cumin make a nice combo and tastes more chili like. After that the flavor was good but the texture was too thick and added 1 c of chicken broth to get it too the right consistency.I added a can of black beans just because I like beans in my chili.

Cooked right to the recipe and LOVED it! There is not a huge pumpkin taste, just enough to enjoy.

Will def cook again and again :)

Found this recipe when searching for non-dessert ways to use the pumpkin puree I had leftover from Thanksgiving. As many reviewers have, I changed mine up a bit from the recipe. First, I decided to use my slow cooker rather than cook it on the stove top. I used onion and garlic powder instead of the onion and garlic and used red and yellow bell peppers. Once I got everything into the crockpot, it looked way too thick, so I added some chicken broth and a small can of v8 juice. As it cooked, I added some more salt and spices. Came out excellent!

Best chili recipe I've tried from All Recipes yet! I added a lot of spice to kick it up a notch. My husband who hates pumpkin was lured by the smell from the kitchen and then ended up eating 3 bowls!

Excellent base recipe.  I spiced it up with additional hot sauce for my taste but it was surprisingly good without additional ingredients.

Pretty good - the pumpkin definitely adds creaminess but definitely follow others suggestions re: added spice and veggies. Added can of drained sweet corn and nutmeg/cinnamon (we actually just used several strong dashes of pumpkin spice) made all the difference.

I loved this recipe. I'm a vegetarian so left out the turkey and added black beans, canned corn, extra bell peppers.  I had to add extra chili pepper and cumin and cayenne pepper to make it spicy. It's a little mild as is.

This was awesome.  However, based on other comments, I did make some changes.

I added 1 can of Ro-tel tomatoe's.  This helps to give it some added kick and spice
Also added the following:
1 can of vegetable broth
2 Bay leaves
1 tsp of oregano

This came out great! It is easy to tailor the recipe to suit your personal preferences. For example, I added a can of black beans, drained, and a couple handfuls of frozen corn. Definitely needs some chicken broth for desired consistency. I forgot to buy diced tomatoes, so I used an equivalent amount of salsa (drained). Added cumin and extra chili powder. At the end of cooking, squeezed in some fresh lime juice, and next time I will add some chopped cilantro for color and flavor. Even my BF, who doesn't care for traditional beef-kidney bean chili, loved this turkey version. He was eating it right from the pot after I made it.

Just made this for a potluck Halloween Party - no leftovers! It was a bit bland so I added flavors to enhance the pumpkin - a little allspice and a little bit of ground cloves. Added also cayenne pepper because you need a little bit of a bite of spicy hot. One more thing I added that really brought all the flavors together, because it was thick and I didn't have chicken broth... a bottle of pumpkin beer! You definitely need to taste, taste and taste again to adjust to your liking, but definitely DEEElicious! Thanks for sharing.

I like the creativeness of this recipie, its a great base for something completely different and delicious.

 The original recipie was a bit bland I thought, so I added 1 tbs garlic granuales, 2 tbs of chili powder, 1 1/2 tbs of basil and added them in before the liquid to the cooking meat and veg. to cook for about 5 mins before adding the rest of the wet ingredients. I also used about 4 cloves of garlic and I had doubled the recipie. I also added mushrooms and Kidney beans for the extra fiber. Served with fresh bread and creme fresh and low fat gratted chedar.

Over-all, its definitely a keeper and it was very very tasty!

Being fall right now I figured this recipe would be perfect and it came out very nicely. Having read most of the reviews I decided to add some additional ingrediences as well. First off I used ground beef because that's what I had at home. I added one can of kidney beans, one cup of frozen corn, one cup of chickenbroth and instead of adding all kinds of individual spices I used Taco Seasoning Mix. Other than that I followed the recipe. It's a great fall recipe that's hearty and easy to prepare.

I was so excited to find this recipe because I luv pumpkin in savory dishes. I agree with others, its bland as is. Great base recipe, but needs more. I added chicken broth, cumin,franks red hot and some brown sugar, not a lot of brown sugar, about 3 tablespoons. It really complimented the punch of the extra hot sauce in the chili, and suits our taste. I also added a can of white kidney beans. As with most chilis you need to flavor to your personal taste, this is a great recipe to do that with. My over all impression decent recipe when made exact, fantastic when you change the recipe to your tastes.

I like this chili with a pumpkin base instead of a tomato base.  However, like many of the other reviews commented it is very bland in my opinion.  I added a can of black beans, a can of corn, and a cup of chicken stock to add more to the base of the chili.  Then in addition to 2 Tblsp of chili powder I added 1 1/2 Tblsp of Southwest Chipotle Ms. Dash.  Instead of using all the cut up bell peppers I just threw in a cas of original rotel as well.  My family loved it and I would make it again.

I'm giving this four stars because it's an excellent base recipe, but it definitely needs some little extras for flavor and personal taste.

As my base recipe, I used: 2 cups pure pumpkin puree, 1/2 cup chicken broth, 2 cans diced tomatoes with jalapenos, and 1lb ground lean beef (just what I had on hand). I added 1/2 diced onion, 1 diced yellow pepper, and 1 diced orange pepper. For seasoning, I added chili powder, cumin, coriander, chipotle, red pepper flakes, 2 bay leaves, brown sugar, and salt and pepper. I couldn't even tell you the amounts, I just added pinches in until I was satisfied with the flavor. I loved the texture of this chili, the pumpkin gave it a beautiful light silky creamy texture.

I love pumpkin but I needed a different way of using it besides making pies. I came across this recipe and thought how strange to use pumpkin in chili but what the heck I will try it. I read the reviews and took the advice and tweak it by adding black beans, corn red bell pepper, orange bell pepper,(you can just use 1/2 of orange & red bell peppers) 2 cups of spicy tomato juice, more chili powder, corriander, cumin, (1 tsp each) 1 tsp cinnamon  1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp allspice, bay leaves and honey to taste. It turned out great!! The kids loved it. My son likes it spicier my daughter and I like it on the sweet side. With this recipe you can do either just by adjusting the amount of chili powder and the honey. Then I made this for a potluck and I bet 8 or 9 ppl asked for the recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Pumpkin is one of my favorite fall foods, so I had to try this recipe.  Basic recipe is really good, but a bit bland for me.  I exchanged the ground turkey for ground chicken and added quite a bit more chili powder & seasonings.

Great dinner. Didn't use turkey. Added corn, chick peas, and black beans for some bulk. Doubled up on thick tomatoes. Had to add a lot more spice to give it some heat.

Very good, with a few modifications.  After reading the other reviews regarding blandness, I used red pepper (instead of yellow), Zesty diced tomatoes (instead of regular) and extra chili pepper.  I also added a little water since it seemed too thick otherwise.

Great base recipe!!  I added a 14.5 oz. can of chicken broth, an extra can of diced tomatoes and some left over corn I had.  I also added 1 tbsp. ground cumin.  This is a very hearty chili and very filling.  It's also another great recipe for those who enjoy lower carb meals.

great fall chili. You can try a can of regular pumpkin or a can that already has spices in it for a sweeter taste

I have made this before and it is delicious.  The recipe I use also includes a can of kidney beans, a can of chopped green chilies, a dash of cumin, and a dash of cayenne pepper.

I really like this dish. I did follow babybunnie's recipe, but it turned out too sweet. next time I'll omit the honey and half the amount of orange concentrate. I did add couple of more things, 2 tsp sumac, 2 tbsp pepper paste, 1 tsp green thai paste. It was really good. Thank you Someoneswt

Loved this recipe, made a double batch and gave some to friends.  They loved it too!  Added fresh cilantro to the garnish.

I was disappointed in the mildness of this chili. I had to add a lot more "heat" to make it interesting. Won't be making this again.

Love this recipe! I add a lot more than the recommended pumpkin, plus a can or so of corn, black beans, and whatever spicy peppers I can find.  I also add cayenne, cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar until I find the sweet/spicy combo that I like the best.

So I, like many others, tried all the upgrades, and this chili got a great score from my husband and friend!  I added corn and kidney beans, cumin (probably about 2 tbsp), extra chili powder, maybe...half a cup of chicken broth (a little bit when I first got it simmering, and then a little more after about 10 minutes of simmering when the chili seemed a little thick).  I also added a squirt of honey in the last 5 minutes as well.  This was DELISH.  I'm so glad someone gave us the idea to put pumpkin in chili--who woulda thunk it?

I used the suggestions others made about additional ingredients and seasonings and wow -- we all loved this! We don't like green peppers so we used all yellow. Planned to use ground turkey but after checking out the price, used extra lean ground beef instead. We did serve with some light sour cream and Thai chili paste on the side for DH and I (we like it hot). Our 8 & 10 year old daughters loved it as much as we did. We have it for dinner yesterday and it goes in thermoses for lunch tomorrow! A real keeper -- healthy, tasty, and easy.

I followed everyone's advice and added the black beans, corn, extra tomatoes (I actually used Ro*tel), extra spices, etc. and this turned out Amazing!  Maybe even better then the chili my granma taught me to make that I always brag about.  Please give this one a try.

Very good, satisfying recipe.   I prefer to use fresh foods, so I made my own pumpkin puree using a fresh pumpkin, but otherwise followed the recipe. On tasting, I added a half-tsp of hot cayenne pepper to give it a bit of a kick.  I'm happy with the results.

This chili was a big hit at my Halloween party but I only gave it 4 stars because I did go ahead and follow some of the other revisions and made some additions of my own. I went ahead and added a can of corn and a can of black beans, along with a small can of tomato sauce (to give it a little more broth), 2 tsp of cumin, ground coriander, paprika, red pepper flakes and ground cayenne pepper. I also threw in 10 mild jalapenos (the ones that are thinly sliced.) It was delicious and had a great "kick" I will definitely make this again!!

I made this just as written and found that other reviewers were right when they said it was very bland.  It was also beyond thick.  I added an extra can of diced tomatoes, a can of black beans (rinsed), and some chicken broth to make it a little better consistency.  I also added garlic salt, extra chili powder and minced onion.  After all that (which wasn't any work at all) it really was very good.  My husband even liked it and couldn't believe I had put pumpkin in it.  Good base recipe.  Definitely needs tweaking.

This was pretty good, but the texture of the pumkin kind of bothered me.  I did add a second can of tomatoes because it was so thick.  My family said it wasn't bad, but I probably won't make it again, since there are definitely chili recipes I like better.

FANTASTIC recipe! This was the most amazing chili I have ever had- AND it didn't have to simmer for hours and hours. I added an extra can of tomatoes, a can of black beans, a can of corn and it was delicious!  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because none of us could taste the pumpkin in it :( SO SAD! So, I'm gonna try making it again with double the pumpkin and see if that helps out at all. Fantastic recipe though! Truly delicious!

What a yummy chili base. The pumpkin gives it body that you can work in other flavors. I did however tweak this just a little. I added cilantro, frozen corn, 1/2 tblspn more of chilli powder, creole seasoning, hot madras curry powder and a little ground clove. This is so yummy I served it with rice , a sprinkle of sharp cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream and and a side of crackers

I was NOT impressed with this chili.  It was really thick and dry and I added 3 cups of water to it.  The taste was bland and using turkey made the texture strange.  Just wasn't for me, I guess.

i'm giving this 4 stars only because i had to add a ton more spices to make this actually taste like chili, but once i did, we loved it.  i didn't share the secret with anyone in my family that there was pumpkin in there or they wouldn't have touched it.  i really liked the texture the pumpkin added.  and the joy it gave me tricking my family was wonderful as well.

I was really hoping to like this but I didn't. Sounded delicious but there was definitely something missing - so I tried adding ingredients (garlic powder, onion powder, beans, corn, more chili powder, you name it), which helped, but still not great. My husband did enjoy it, but I won't be saving this recipe.

As written, this chili is definitely lacking something.  I made a double batch and added black beans, kidney beans, chopped celery, tomato paste, and cumin.  Came out delicious but tasted like regular chili, probably because I altered it so much.  Great way to use up extra pumpkin.  Next time I make it I'll try to find a balance of getting good flavor without hiding the pumpkin.

This was outstanding!  I used fire-roasted canned tomatoes and added some light red kidney beans. What a wonderful Fall dinner--we had sparkling apple cider and honey buttered corn muffins on the side!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Healthier than real chili, yes, but if you're from Texas don't use this recipe as a substitute for the real thing, comparitivly it's very bland. I guess if you add chili pepper to anything it makes it "chili" even squash. haha.

I love this recipe!  It was a delicious chili with a hint of pumpkin flavor.  I added some cumin and chicken brother per some of the reviews and served it over plain risotto.  Very light and healthy.  It can also be played with easily to suite anyone's tastes.

I took others advice and added a can of black beans and also added an extra can of diced tomatoes.  However i found diced tomatoes with mild green chilies in them and it worked out really well.  Also i added 2 tsp of ground cumin and corriander as well.  I love the combination of those two spices, especially with the black beans.  The heat was just right for me and i felt no need to add any additional pepper flakes or chili powder. This is a great healthy recipe and it even passed my parents (who usually can spot a recipe that i have made "healthier").  They both loved this one.  I will definitely make this again!

I followed the advice of others. So, in short, I used 2 UNDRAINED cans of tomatoes (one w/ green chiles added), added1 can black beans, 1 tsp cumin (approx until it tasted right), and 2 tsp minced dried bay leaves. I used one whole green pepper instead of the two 1-cup amounts and I used 1 lb of ground beef. Topped with shredded "Mexican" cheese and sour cream. I had NO taste of pumpkin so this is a GREAT way to add nutrients without sacrificing taste. THIS WILL BE SPICY especially for a young child. My 2-year old AND 1-year old ate it after I added lots of sour cream.

Really delicious alternative to traditional chili!!!  I too made alterations including ones many reviewers suggested such as adding 3 T chili powder, 1 1/2t cumin, 1t Cinnamon, 1/2t nutmeg and cloves.  Also I used 3/4 of a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes since I didn't have diced. Will definitely be making this again!  We served it with a nice Semolina bread and butter..YUM!

Absolutely delicious! I tweeked it a little bit. Used red pepper instead of yellow, added about a 1/2 cup frozen corn and a can of red kidney beans. Also, I added about a 1/8 tsp. of red pepper flakes when sauteing the onion/peppers. Also added about a 1/2 tbsp ground cumin. Once it was simmered, I happened to add more chili powder and cumin. Overall, what a delicious chili dish!

I make a lot of chili from my own recipe;this is one of the better ones I've tried from another source. I made it as is with the exception of: for ease of prep, I just browned the turkey and threw the peppers and onion in with it and let it cook for awhile before I added the other ingredients; I added some cayenne for a little more heat; I put in a can of drained kidney beans just because they were in the pantry-I'm sure it would be good without them. Also, when cooking with herbs, spices, chili powders, etc., I put them in with the browning meat or sauteeing oil because the direct intense heat helps them release their oils, adding more flavor to the finished dish. Thanks for posting this recipe-I really like finding new ways to use pumpkin without putting it in a dessert!

The taste was pretty good, although slightly bland. The worst part of this dish was the texture: VERY thick. I liked the unique taste that the pumpkin added, but if I made it again, I would add chicken broth or something to thin it out.

I like to make this in the fall.  I double it and add two cans of kidney beans to be able to feed my family of 6 with only about one lunch portion leftover.  I found that it needs salt.  For my doubled recipe, 1 teaspoon of salt seemed to work well.  I also added a half a teaspoon of cumin and the tiniest shake of cinnamon (my regular, go-to chili recipe has cinnamon, so I thought why not give it a try here - and it works).  UPDATE: Added a small splash of apple cider vinegar and some red pepper likes.

I eliminated the peppers (they don't like us!) and added a can of drained black beans and a can of drained navy beans and a cup of corn.  I entered it in a chili cook off at my work and won!

What a cool idea adding pumpkin! I didn't actually taste the pumpkin, but it thickened it up a good deal- plus all that added vitamin A was a bonus. My only changes as I went along were I added a can of tomato sauce- as it was SUPER thick (not a bad thing, just personal preference), some additional chili powder and pepper, and some cumin. Really fabulous as is, just wanted to spice it up a bit more- my adding a can of tomato sauce also watered down the original spices too, so I needed to compensate. Will definitely make again as my entire family loved it.

As the recipe stands this is quite bland. However...lot's of opportunity here to turn this into a five star chili. The recipe creates a good platform to build on and build on we did! Some of the reviews suggested starting out with fresh lean Turkey Breast. Thank you! The quality of the meat is more tender and an overall upgrade from regular ground Turkey. I included all the ingredients then started to enhance by adding freshly grated ginger & curry powder, which married very well with the pumpkin. I did opt for the Libby's pumpkin pie filling and I used one cup only. I also increased the quantity of Turkey to 2 pounds. The two cans of tomatoes I added had diced jalapenos then I threw in a large can of whole tomatoes which I chopped. I was more generous with the garlic too. Because we really created a new recipe with a completely different set of flavors we did not add the cheese as a topping and  substituted cilantro and sour cream. Although this is a stretch to be considered a chili this dish delivered surprising tastes with each bite. I would have to say we were loving the taste and it turned out to be an unexpected combination of flavors we would look forward to putting together many more times in the future.

This is one of my favorite recipes- after some tweaking of course. So many reviewers said it was good and you couldn't taste the pumpkin. Well- I wanted to taste the pumpkin. I used the pumpkin pie filling instead of just regular pumpkin and I used only 1 cup. I also used 1 cup chicken broth- 1 can black beans- 1 can corn and instead of regular tomatoes I used fire roasted tomatoes with chiles. I also added 2 tsps of cumin. It was perfect! At first you had a sweet flavor and then you were hit with spicy goodness. LOVED IT. I can't rave enough. The sweet to spicy flavor was brilliant.

I thought this was very good, and the mild flavor worked for my 3-year-old who liked it a lot!  I did add a can of black beans and about a teaspoon of cumin. I also added water as it was too thick-- chicken broth would have been better, but I didn't have any on hand.  I will definitely make it again.

I recieved a recipe for Pumpkin Chili from a co-worker a couple of years ago.  Since then I have altered this recipe and entered it in a many chili cook off's.  The great thing with this recipe is that you can add/alter just about anything.  In my opinion chili is all about personal taste.  Some like it spicy.. some a but more mild.  Grab a spoon and taste as you go!.  

Suggestions.. 
pumpkining spice is really what adds the "pumpkin" flavor to this recipe. 
Don't forget to add sugar or sweetener.. even with your chili spices (spicy) it will add to the overall affect.

I use cambell's tomato soup in my recipe.  

Any kind of noodle will add weight. I have even used orzo!

Great recipe! Super easy too!

This was such an easy chilli recipe.  I wasn't sure about the pumpkin but it gives it a smooth, rich consistency.  I used whole tomatoes which I broke up with a wooden spoon while cooking, added 1 can kidney beans, and added some sugar to take the edge off the tomatoes.  Its easy and tasty.

I love this recipe. I will make it for myself for dinner and lunches when my husband is not home. Very quick and easy.

The strongest flavor was from the ground turkey, the pumpkin was not noticable. I also made some changes to the recipe. I left the peppers out, added additional chili powder to taste and added a little italian seasoning. As the other reviews noted, this is a thick chili so I added 1/2 of a can of tomato sauce to thin it out. 

I then took the left overs to work the next day to test on my Aunt who liked it but said maybe she would have opted for ground chicken or beef rather than turkey.

I cooked this for my husband who is a picky eater. He did not notice any flavor of pumpkin in it but, did not like it. I don't normally cook with ground turkey so I think that was his problem.

I first made the chili as listed, and it was way too bland for me.   So, following other reviewers suggestions, I used:   3 T chili powder, 1 T cumin, 1 tsp. cayenne, 1 T sugar.   Also added 2 cans of beans and a couple chopped jalapenos.   I should note, that by the time I was finished I could no longer taste the pumpkin, as it was pretty spicy!  (The way I like it).  Is it better than a traditional steak/beef/pork sausage type chili?  Not to me.  But, it is the best "healthy" chili I've ever made.  

**P.S.   You know, we had this chili for leftovers a couple days later, and the flavor was definitely better.  I'm changing my rating to 5 stars.

YUM!  I read through all the reviews and added a can of black beans, a bag of frozen sweet corn, cinnamon, nutmeg, bay leaves, and a dash of tabasco sauce.  The longer it sits, the better it tastes as the flavors have time to blend. I served it with homemade cornbread.  Just the right combo of sweet, spicy, and salt.

My boyfriend and I really liked this! this is what I did differently after reading the other reviews.  I added corn and instead of the seasonings listed, I used two packets of chili seasoning.  I also thought it seemed really thick like the other reviewers and made it a little creamier and less chunky by mixing in about 3/4 of a cup of butternut squash soup.  finally i topped with goat cheese instead of cheddar or sour cream.  It's great!

I make this about every 2 weeks- it's been great for South beach diet phase 2!  I added celery for crunch, white beans instead of kidney.  I don't use the corn because of the starch.  I add chipotle for some extra heat.  

I love this recipe.  It's easy and low fat and high fiber.  When I'm not dieting, I serve it with cornbread muffins with cheese and jalapenos for guests.  

I like eating this for lunch at work: it's very satisfying.

Four stars it gets for originality. Needs to be spiced up for flavor, but it's very hearty and an interesting variation of chilli. Festive. I made it for Halloween dinner. The turkey is a nice change from beef/soy beef, and the pumpkin makes for an interesting texture and color.

The recipe sounded interesting so I made it but, I used fresh pumpkin.  To my suprise it turned out great!  The kids loved it until I told them it was pumpkin.  I did add more salt that the recipie called for before serving.  Go ahead just try it!

The recipe sounded interesting with the pumpkin, so decided to use it as a base. I ended up adding quite a bit of other things. I omitted the peppers and can diced tomatoes. I upped the garlic gloves to 3 and continued to add: white beans (15oz), kidney beans (27oz), black beans (15oz), cinnamon (1/4tsp, ended up being a bit much though), cumin (2tsp), corn (15oz), sugar (2 Tbs), 1 can tomato soup. It was nice a thick, the way we liked it. I think the pumpkin added to the nice consistency, but you could not taste it at all, a bit disappointed in that end. We served with sour cream and tortilla chips.

A great taste. Not really 'pumpkin-y' at all- the pumpkin just helps fill out the unique flavor. Very easy to make and a family favorite.

I ADORED this recipe..  I adjusted it to my taste..  I had no fresh bell peppers so I used a few roasted red peppers chopped.  I added a can of kidney beans (drained), and about a 1/4 cup of chicken stock..  As well, I like a bit of spice so I added about 2 tsp worth of cumin..  I also added a 1/2 cup of ketchup for added sweetness and to cut the acidity of the canned tomatoes..  Excellent!  No one will know you are serving them pumpkin :)

This wasn't too bad.  I used ground beef instead of turkey (it's all I had), subbed a can of green chilis for the yellow pepper (out of that, too).  Very strong acidic tomato taste for my liking, but my husband enjoyed it.  Said he never would have tasted it if I'd told him the "secret ingredient".  The pumpkin adds nutrients as well as mellowing out the chili.  Nice!

Wonderful.  I used 3 T of chili powder as some suggested, and two cans of rinsed black beans.  I also added a T of cumin and 3 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of one.  Excellent.

Quick, healthy and delicious!  I like my chili spicy so I doubled the garlic, increased the chili powder and added cumin.  I also added a bit of cinnamon because I thought it would go well with the pumpkin and other spices.  I added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) and a can of vegetable broth and simmered for about half an hour.  I will definitely make this often!

We (husband and I) really enjoyed this recipe with modifications. Daughter (age 5) said that she did not like the fact that she could taste onions. (Go figure.) I served the chili with sliced baguette.

Here are my modifications:
- Reduced onion to 1/2 cup
- Only used yellow peppers
- Increased garlic to 2 cloves (and in the future will add more)
- Added 2 small cans (4 oz each?) of V8
- Added one small container of Organic chicken broth
- Added 1tsp cumin
- Reduced chili powder to 2tsp
- Added one can of corn (drained)
- Increased salt to 2-1/2 tsp

I will defintely make it again. It has a very slight sweetness that most tomato-based chilis don't have.

Hard to believe there is pumpkin in this.  This is a great recipe although I followed other reviewers suggestions and added some pumpkin pie spice, a bit more chili powder and instead of chicken broth I added a 28oz can of tomatoes.  Great!!!

Delicious. My family raved. Exotic and comforting, all at once. Chili is almost a misnomer...it's so lovely and sweet and spicy. Next time I think I will serve it over rice.

This was 5 stars only with my modifications based on input from other rewiews. It is a great base to start with though. I added chicken broth, extra pumpkin (instead of throwing it out) cilantro, cumin and a can of white beans. I think any sort of bean would be fine. It just needed a little something extra.Without the broth it would have been quite dry.

I love this for how quick, easy and nutritious it is. I really liked the flavour, but be warned that it is rather mild - you may want to spice it up a bit. It's great "as is" for kids. I'm sure I'll make it again.

The ingredients in this recipe really appealed to me, and I love the low fat, nutritious element. I added cumin, cilantro, and corn, but it was still just too bland. It was so thick that I couldn't stir it, so added a full 2 cups of chicken broth to get a thick chili-like consistency, but it needs something more. And since I don't know what...I don't think it's a repeater for me.

I made this tonight for the first time but I took the advice of babybunnies, one of the commentators on this page.  I added black beans, and all of the spices she suggested.  I DID NOT add the honey, tomato juice or orange juice concentrate because I did not have those on hand.  I might try those next time I make it.  Instead of cheddar cheese, I used shaved Parmesan and Sea Salt --it was delish!

Yum!  I add a can of corn and double the tomatoes. The smaller diced work better in my opinion.  Sometimes you may need to add a little liquid/broth, but it's a judgement call each batch. Sour cream and Frank's Hot Sauce to taste with the served product!

I made this recipe for a Halloween get-together. Everyone loved it! I made the following modifications: cheese and sour cream were on the side as several of us are vegan. I substituted seitan for the ground turkey, though the chili is hearty enough to omit this completely (or substitute your favorite beans). I also added a pinch of cayenne, 1 tbsp cumin, and 1tsp red pepper flakes. I prefer mild tastes, but chili isn't chili without a little heat!

This was a good base recipe but I added a can of corn, black beans, and half a jalapeño, red chili flakes, oregano, lemon pepper and probably a tablespoon of Apple cider vinegar to give it a bit of a bite. Also threw in some cloves and a dash of cinnamon. If I had a lime I think it would have been a better but it turned out well! Oh! I also added a half a can of crushed tomatoes to add more sauce to compensate for the addition of beans and corn. I served it over rice.

the reason is it was very bland and not enough flavor. It needs more spice and flavor. either  more spice or sausage.

Fix this this evening because it was featured on The Today Show. I was skeptical while putting it together. It was way to simple and fast.  Put it on the table and we ate the whole thing. You do not taste the pumpkin and it thickens the Chili perfectly. Adding this to my favorite recipes!

Very good chili recipe. I put ground beef instead of turkey because that is what I had on hand. I also used a packet of taco seasoning, and a can of Rotel.

This is really good. I did have to add some spices (pumpkin pie spice) at the end (I cook by smell, so add as much as it takes for this to become fragrant). Without that addition, it was kind of bland. I did have people the next day in school asking me what I was eating, and for the recipe.

This was a lot better than I expected.  My grandsons (5 & 8) loved it!  My persnickety daughter turned up her nose but loved it when she tried it and asked me to make it regularly.  Thank you!

This is so good, healthy, quick and easy... and has become our Halloween tradition.  I triple the recipe in my crockpot and serve it at our culdesac party by the campfire.  People who haven't tried it are always hesitant but end up eating three bowls or so.  We serve it with the following on the side so everyone can create their own bowl: corn chips, sour cream, shredded cheddar, jalapenos, and red pepper flakes.

The foundations of the recipe are good, but it required a lot of playing with seasoning.  As written, the chili was very bland. I will make it again, though, adding more chili powder, some cumin and chipotle chili powder, a shot of cider vinegar, a bit of sugar and more salt, too.

I love this, as a base recipe, and especially the addition of pumpkin!  This has become a regular meal in our home.  I think I can only fairly give it 4 stars, as I've altered to personal taste, and always do it in my crock pot.  The additions I've made are: 1 can each of kidney and black beans, sliced mushrooms, cumin, parsley, cayenne and red pepper flakes, and a couple tbs of brown sugar.  Set it in my crock pot for 8 hrs-and yumm!

The missing ingredient to this recipe is BROWN SUGAR! Add a few Tablespoons and it goes from bland to amazing.  I also threw in some pumpkin pie spice.  My husband loves it that way.  For myself, I added extra chili powder and some crushed red peppers because I like my chili with more of a kick.  My husband took his leftovers to work and his coworkers begged me to make more for them!   I made this about a half dozen times during this fall.

This recipe was so simple and DELICIOUS!  We served it to our dinner guests and they loved it as well.  I also added a chopped jalapeno to give it an extra kick and a can of kidney beans to bulk it up just a bit more.  Other than that, the recipe was perfect!  I didn't need to build on it at all :)  A super win and will be making this again and again!

You don't taste the pumpkin at all but it adds lots of vitamins and fiber to the dish. Your family will never know! I added some cumin and a little extra chili powder. You can easily adjust spices to your taste. Will definately make again

This chili was okay. If you are expecting a traditional chili with pumpkin flavor this is not for you. This makes a very thick pumpkin soup (think pumpkin bisque) that happens to contain turkey, veggies, and chili seasoning.

Really good but the consistency was a bit thick so I thinned it out with some chicken broth.
Great way to add veggies to a dish.  Made this for a Halloween party

Delicious! I did a double take when I saw that this chili recipe didn't have any beans, but the pumpkin is so hearty that you don't even miss them. The next time I make this recipe I'm going to experiment with adding more ingredients to make the batch stretch even further.

Definitely a good base, but made some changes. First, I sautéed the ground turkey, removed, then added onion and peppers. Once softened, I added garlic and then turkey again. Then added spices...chili powder, cumin and coriander.  (add more chili powder than recipe calls for).  I also added a can of black beans. Pumpkin adds creaminess but not overpowering. Delish :)

I was very excited to try this, but unfortunately it left something to be desired. It's very hearty, but the pumpkin flavor doesn't come through at all. I added beans, cumin, extra garlic, onion and even a little taco seasoning, and it was still bland. The only explanation I can come up with is that the pumpkin masks all other flavor. Maybe a good starter, but you'll have to play with this recipe to make it a winner.

This was great. I added 2 cans of navy beans, and 1 tablespoon of cumin and ancho chili.  I also let it cook for about 2 hours in my dutch oven.  To finish I topped with cilantro.

This is quite bland if you expect a bit of a kick and great flavor from your chili.  I decided that I liked the base of this recipe and have since modified it to suit my taste!  I switched out the turkey for ground italian sausage(mild), 1 whole green pepper and 1 whole yellow pepper, 1 can and a 1/4 of a can of pumpkin(1/4 more only because i had extra left over, but I think it works better with more), cubed up into a little less than an inch uncooked sweet potato.  Added about a cup of chicken broth and a cup of water. Cooked on low for 3 or 4 hours and bumped it up to high for about an hour- or until sweet potatoes are cooked through. Everything else I left as is.  This was far more flavorful and very filling!  Ends up looking like a thick stew.

This was a great recipe!  My family loved it.  The only thing that I changed was I used 3 cloves of garlic...by mistake and 1 tablespoon of chili powder (we aren't a spicy family) and 3\4 of a small can of chicken broth, just to thin it, but it was still thick....if that makes sense.

Easy and very good.  To me it didn't taste much different from regular chili but is creamier and I like knowing that pumpkin is healthy.  Next time I might add navy beans.

I followed the recipe exactly, but it was very bland and too thick. I like a thick, rich chili, but this was almost more like a paste. I will probably make it again in the future but use some of the suggestions I've seen here.

This chili was very good and I will definitely make again.  However it was a little bland for me tastes so the next time I make it I will add a few things to spice it up.  Adding the pumpkin to the chili was a great idea!

This recipe was greatvwith a little tweeking. Like others I added black beans but I uses McCormic prepackaged chili seasoning. To the sauté I also added red bell pepper since I had it on hand. I also had a can of jalapeño pinto beans that gave the chili just enough extra spice and moisture. Topped with cheddar and a dallop of daisy it was a hit... Definitely a keeper since my husband (and I) went for seconds .

This was out-of-this-world fantastic.  I think the pumpkin gives the chili a fuller, richer flavor, not as acidic as regular chili.  I did add red kidney beans and processed my own pumpkin.  The kids did not even notice it was there ;)

Okay dish, but not fabulous. Maybe if I had made it before I tried the butternut squash and turkey chili. Really is rather bland. If I make again, I might see if any of the ingredients in the butternut squash/turkey chili would enhance this recipe.

2.5 stars. As other reviewers have noted, the chili needs some more flavor. I also thought the pumpkin and turkey flavors didn't really go together.

I was a little nervous about trying a pumpkin chili, but the pumpkin wasn't overwhelming. I made it with the original seasonings listed, and it was very bland. But, the next day, I added more spices to it, and it was very flavorful. A good base recipe, but needs more seasoning.

Excellent consistancy, thick and rich.  I added a tablespoon of cumin to balance the chili spice.  I also added a 1/2 cup corn.  Good flavor but needs a stronger base since turkey doesn't have much fat.  Maybe some beans next time.  All in all I will keep and make again.  The pumpkin flavor is subtle.  Don't shy away from the pumpkin it's an excellent addition.

I came upon this on Halloween and thought it perfect for the occasion.  It was great.  I used half the turkey and added a can of black beans.  I also added some cumin for a little more flavor.

This recipe was good with a few modifications.  Added more chili powder than called for, some ground cumin, red pepper flakes, and a shake of nutmeg.  Also, subbed Rotel for the diced tomatoes, added a few T of Worcestershire sauce, a can of black beans and a bottle of dark beer.  If I make it again, I will use a packet of Williams chili seasoning rather than the chili powder.  This probably isn't my favorite chili recipe but it's so healthy, was easy to make and tasted pretty good.

I found this recipe tasteless; the pumpkin didn't enhance flavor as regular turkey chilli.  Did not like at all, but thanks for sharing.  I do like to try non-traditional recipes.

Thank you for the great start.  I did make it my own by adding chili beans, black beans, and some black eyed peas, but never would have thought to use pumpkin.  And I tend to favor hamburger so using the turkey was a nice lower fat alternative.

Probably 3-4 Stars without changes.  5 Stars using babybunnies' suggestions.  This was delicious!  I loved how warm and filling it was while still tasting light and flavorful.  I'll be making this a lot!  The corn and black beans were very important to round out the flavors.  Thanks Someoneswt!

I have to admit that I was skeptical about the addition of the pumpkin.  I made sure that I made this after the rest of my family left this morning.  I put it in my slow cooker and let it cook for about 8 hours.  I did not use the green peppers as some have a sensitivity to them.  Instead I added a few white beans that I had leftover and a little corn.  This chili is as my kids said "the bomb".  No one could guess the "secret" ingredient, and they were shocked when I told them it was pumpkin.  This stuff is really good, so easy, and I will be making it again soon.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was so good! I agree with the other reviewers, this needs jazzed up a bit to make it flavorful enough so I strongly suggest adding some sort of beans (I added black beans, but pinto or kindney would be good too) one can of corn, and LOTS of seasoning since the recipe doesn't call for much. I added cumin, lots of chili powder, some pumpkin pie spice, red pepper flake, more salt, etc. It is pretty bland otherwise. The pumpkin makes it way creamy and you can't even really taste it. :) Happy cooking.

I made this last night - it was delicious! In addition to the ingredients listed, I added one small can of green chilies, 14 oz can of chick peas, 14 oz can of corn. I also added about one tbs ground cumin, extra chili power (2 tbs total), 1 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 tbs hot sauce.    Very easy to prepare and cook and everyone loved it - great!

The turkey/pumpkin combination is a great idea and our family doesn't eat beans so there are positive things about this recipe.  However, the chili is very thick so I added a can of chicken broth and 6 oz. tomato juice.  I also added 2 tsp. cumin and more chili powder.

To each his own...I read a number of positive reviews, but my husband and I weren't thrilled with this - we both felt like we would just prefer a traditional chili.  I think I followed the recipe pretty closely (unless I made a mistake, which is always a possibility with my cooking...)

This is a great base recipe.  While I prefer a more spicy chili, my younger children do not and fortunately this is a mild chili that still has a nice flavor.  I generally use crushed tomatoes and add beans and 1/2 beer.  Beyond that it depends on who is eating whether I add extra chili powder, peppers, cumin, etc.  I've even used pumpkin pie filling when pumpkin puree was not available.  It made a sweeter chili, but still good.  =D

I was really looking forward to this recipe. It sounded wonderful. Because I was afraid to experiment too much, I stuck with the recipe and didn't add more spices or other ingredients.  I would like to try it again with the additional ingredients but I know that any attempt to try it again will be rejected because it was bland this time. I wish I had a handy toddler or two nearby to eat the rest instead of having to throw it away!

This is pretty good. Like many other reviewers, I ramped it up a little - added 2 tsp cumin, a pinch of red pepper flakes, a bit more chili powder than called for, one bay leaf, and I also added a dash of pumpkin pie spice. Plus, one 8oz can of tomato sauce. The result is a nice, healthy chili with a moderate amount of spice. If I make this again, I might add one more can of tomatoes OR another can of sauce, plus will double the vegetables because I like veggies.

This is a great basic starter but really bland it really needs a lot of add ins. I added about 3 Tbsp chili powder plus 3 Tbsp of a hotter chili powder along with allspice nutmeg cinnamon cumin an extra can of tomatoes and a cup of chicken broth. I will use pumpkin in my favorite chili but will not make this one again.

I think this is an excellent base recipe for chili. When I make a new recipe I always try it first just as written before I mess with it. I found as it is, it is very bland - pumpkin and turkey in general just don't have a whole lot of flavor. However, it was perfect for my kids and had so many easy, healthy ingredients. I tried again with some modifications to get it to my preferred spice level - I increased the chili powder some and added chipotle tabasco sauce, and the chipotle really seemed to  compliment the turkey flavors. I served with a shredded sharp cheddar and sour cream, and put out black olives for the kids to "decorate" their bowls with. Fantastic way to get healthy food into your family, that is also tasty for adults!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I was looking for a turkey soup recipe to use up some leftover Thanksgiving turkey and I found this.  Since I also had a bunch of leftover pumpkin puree, I decided to try out this recipe.  I didn't have any peppers (and none of us are fond of them anyway) so I left those out.  I didn't have any canned tomatoes, so I just pureed several fresh tomatoes that I had in the fridge.  Instead of using ground turkey, I shredded some leftover turkey breast meat.  Between there not being any extra tomato liquid and the white meat turkey, the mix was rather dry, so I threw in some leftover gravy and some water.  My husband's not huge on spicy, so I only used 1 tbsp of the chili powder and that was plenty to make this a nice, savory dish without being spicy.  I'll definitely make this again and probably add some black beans (since we both like beans in our chili).

As others have said, this is a great dish but it does need a little kick. I didn't have enough chili powder so I think that would be the best thing to add! Also, next time I will add more pumpkin for a little extra flavor...... The only changes I made were I used an extra can of tomatoes (YUMMMM), a can of black beans, and no yellow pepper (just 1 cup of green pepper). It really would do well adding corn or other types of beans. Give it a try!!

Delicious!!  Healthy alternative to regular chili.  The pumpkin doesn't make it taste different, but it is in there for nutritional value, I guess if you are trying to sneak in more vegetables for the kids.

I was excited to try this recipe, as I like interesting combination.  However, I disappointed with the outcome of this recipe.  I used a sugar pumpkin, pre-cooked it and made the puree myself.  I felt the pumpkin really just made the chili bland.  I put in lots of chili powder and it was as if the pumpkin just sucked up all the spiceness.  I wasn't even keen on eating the leftovers, but I did.  Too bad, it looked like it'd be a winner.

This chili turned out great! I served it to my husband without telling him what was in it and he gobbled it down! The pumpkin flavor isn't prominent at all, it just cuts down on some of the acidity that chili can have. Fun seasonal dish!

This was amazing!  I agree that on its own, it's a little bland.  I added a small can of corn and a can of black beans, rinsed.  I also used about 3 palm fulls of chili powder, a tsp of ground coriander, a tsp of ground cumin seeds and about a 1 tsp of cayenne pepper.  Thick, hearty and delicious!

Wow, this is good!  I used fresh pumpkin, right out of the oven and lightly mashed.  As stated, I think I'd have to agree it was a little bland (but there's something to be said for that if you're feeding kids or folks who aren't into the spice of some chili recipes).  I added a couple teaspoons of cumin and a can of black beans.  I also had to add some liquid as it was too dry for my liking, so I added about 3/4 cup of vegetable stock and let it cook down.   To be honest, it probably could have used some more heat, but still this is very tasty - and if you use the 99.9% fat free ground turkey breast, very healthy!  A keeper for sure!

I followed most of the suggestions of adding corn, black beans, green chilies, etc...and it was fantastic! My housemates had their doubts when I told them the name...I think they finished it off before I could have any leftovers.

My family all loved this chili. I loved the slight pumpkin flavor. The only thing I did different was add black beans and a can of tomato sauce, otherwise it seemed a little too thick.  I also used other reviewers suggestion and put cinnamon on before serving. YUM!

I gave this recipe five stars based on my alterations. This was a great base recipe. I like my chili with a kick, so I added Jalepeno pepper, extra chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, crushed red pepper flakes, 2 bay leaves, light kidney beans, and black beans. I ended up with a chili that had a complex and yummy flavor. You couldn't outright taste the pumpkin, it was very subtle. This is a really thick chili and I like mine a little more soupy so I added two small cans of V8 juice. I served it topped with sour cream and cheddar cheese as suggested. This is something I will make year round! Thank you!

i made this for a football get together and the men were very skeptical... but everyone LOVED it.  The pumpkin flavor  is very mild and overall, this is a great bowl of chili.  Perfect and festive for the fall.

I had to give it a 4, because it needed more flavor, but with my alterations, I would give it a 5. I added a 14.5 oz. can of chicken broth, because it was really, really thick. It was still thick after the chicken broth, but more like chili consisitency. I also added one diced jalapeno, about 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, and increased the chili powder to 2 Tbsp. My husband raised his eyebrows when he heard the ingredients, but ended up really enjoying it. It's difficult to pick up on the pumpkin, but it does give it a slightly sweet touch. The shredded cheese and sour cream really add to the dish too.

Great recipe!! I didn't give it 5 stars because I changed the recipe a bit. I added way more chili powder & also added a few teaspoons of crushed red pepper as well as a can of black beans.When I first tried this, I didn't think I liked it. I thought it was too sweet. Then after a few bites I really started to enjoy it. So so so good! It would also be a great dish to bring to a pot luck.

LOVED IT when the spicy vegetables are doubled.  Try this: double the garlic, green and yellow peppers, and onion.  (We have a little one who wouldn't tolerate doubling the chili powder.)  Serve with chili condiments i.e. tortilla chips, cheese, sour cream or plain yogurt, chives, etc.  As written, it is almost like a dip.  If you like yours soupier, add the tomato juice instead of draining it and add some extra pumpkin (1/2-3/4 cup).  We omitted the salt and used salt-free tomatoes because my husband has to watch his sodium.  Didn't miss it! My friend, Kathryn, whose husband loves pumpkin, is trying to sneak in more veggies for the baby on the way.  She and I tried it the same week, so I'm grateful to have heard her review right before cooking mine as I made changes and had a great first attempt.   Took a triple batch to our small group and people LOVED it!  There weren't any leftovers to take home.  Don't be afraid to try this unusual combination of flavors.  This has instantly become a family favorite and my husband asked me to put it on the "rotation". Also, I used the extra pumpkin to feed my toddler a vegetable he likes with his lunch.

This quick to put together!  We loved the flavor, we didn't specifically taste the pumpkin but it made it nice and thick.  Will be making this one often.

This was good, and it was quick and easy to make.  My family didn't notice the pumpkin, although it really thickened the chili.  I used tomatoes with green chilies in it and added cumin.  I also added beans, so I did change it a little.  We enjoyed it, and I will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't tell anyone what was in the chili before I served it and when I told them, they couldn't believe it! I did add one extra can of tomatoes, it just didn't seem there was enough with one. We will have this dish more this winter!

I was amazed how good this tasted.  No one would have guessed it had pumpkin in it.  I watch my weight so I have steered clear of chili because it can be so high in calories, this is a great way to have your chili and eat it too!

As a base recipe, my family would rate this 5-stars. I used the idea but added my own twists based on what my family likes - spices, beans, a lot more heat. Awesome idea to use the pumpkin to add extra health benefits. We loved the recipe and will use it often!

This is a great recipe to start with, as other reviewers stated.  Came out pretty darn good but really thick.  I ended up adding about 1 1/2 cups of water, Two Cans of kidney beams, and used a whole packet of chilli seasoning instead of the reccomended amount.  Used one small onion, and one small green and yellow bell pepper.  Couldn't really taste the pumpkin. Still a great chilli though

I used ground beef instead of turkey, as I did not have any of that.  Also, added one can of kidney beans, did not use the chili powder as it is too spicy for me, used 1 14.5 oz. can of chicken broth, and omitted the salt.  I liked that this recipe is not too tomatoey...just different and very good.  Would definitely make this again.

I've made chili many different ways but never with pumpkin.  Nice addition.  It was creamy (I am use to using peanut butter to get that creaminess).  Would be a 5 stars for me but I do like a little more seasonings and beans in my chili.  Will definitely make again with the pumpkin.

this is perfect for what to do with your thanksgiving leftovers. but instead of using raw ground turkey(you cook yourself), you use the leftover cooked turkey you grind up yourself, and cubed fresh cooked pumpkin. and add some kidney,or pinto beans.

Last year I did a "test run" on this first and it was really good.  So I made it for a Halloween bonfire and it was a hit.  I did add kidney beans and more to kick it up a notch.  It was something different and I'll probably make it again this year.

I am so glad I tried this!  The pumpkin makes it rich and delicious and you would never know it was pumpkin in it unless someone told you.  I did make some changes though. I omitted the sour cream just because I don't like it and added quite a few more spices to jazz it up and make it more flavorful but it is a great base recipe.

This was way too thick and a bit bland, despite the spiciness. I put in some chicken broth and added some Vegeta (a European soup/food seasoning that you can order online--I rely on it a lot), and it was great! Would make it again with these additions. Don't worry if you're not a pumpkin fan--it doesn't have an overt pumpkin taste. I used a 15-oz. can of pumpkin, which was maybe just a little less than 2 cups.

This was a good chili but I didn't taste the pumpkin at all.  Maybe it's just there for the extra nutrients, or maybe I overwhelmed it by adding carrots, an extra can of tomatoes and 2 cans of beans (kidney and garbanzos).  I know this is totally changing the recipe but it was too plain before.  I think cumin is a necessity in chili so I added 2 tbsp, and I garnished with cilantro.   I would definitely make this again with all my little changes!

Thought this recipe was good but needed a few more things.  I substitued the vegetable oil for olive oil, did add an extra can of diced tomatoes, added a can of black beans (what is chili without beans?) and added coriander, cilantro, ground cumin and a bit of cayenne pepper--love the punpkin sweet flavor with the spicy chili/cayene spice....will definitely make again.
thanks...

ummm well... its a good chili as far as I know. I didn't actually follow the directions at all. I used plain old chopped up turkey left over from thanksgiving, there is probably a bit of sweet potatos in there (I THOUGHT it was pumpkin), corn, a can of black beans, cumin, sea salt, and I tossed it into the crock pot instead of leaving it in the skillet. Its definately a strange recipe, but pretty good.

This was pretty good!  I used ground turkey breast b/c it is even lower in fat than regular ground turkey and I added lentils.  The lentils worked very well in this recipe and add a lot of fiber.  The other thing I did was add more tomatoes... I do not see how this would work with only one can.  Next time I will use crushed instead b/c it makes for a smoother chili.  I added extra spices to mine like some of the others.  Pretty easy and very healthy.  Oh, yes and I did not use the peppers b/c I don't like them in chili.

I tried this recipe on a relatively cool Florida day.  My whole family loved it. A good way to get extra vegetables in our diet.  I added 2 cans of kidney beans to the recipe to make it more like the chili we were used to eating but the pumpkin gave it the best added flavor!

This is really good chili.  I upped the seasoning a little after reading the reviews and instead of using plain diced tomatoes I used rotel tomatoes (that was all I had) and it turned out great.  I have told a few people about the good pumpkin chili and they look at me like I am crazy, but it is really good and you can't taste the pumpkin.

I thought it was decent.  You need to add a lot of spices to make it really good.  However, I brought it to work and the one statement was, "This is not good."  I say try it and then add your own spices.  Oh and a can of beans and some corn really is needed for this recipe to work. I will make it again for myself, I think it is a personal taste.

I rarely rate recipes, although I should because I rely on them so much.  This recipe was awful.  I am from the south and I could not make this work without emptying my pantry.  The problem was that there was too much pumpkin and not enough spice.  I simply could not make it work.

Wonderful chili recipe (especially for Autumn!).  I am very health conscious and found this recipe great because I cook with ground turkey instead of beef and have found that in some recipes, turkey lacks a certain depth that makes a recipe really yummy.  Surprisingly, the pumpkin in this recipe takes care of that problem.  I threw in a package of taco seasoning and topped the chili with some corn chips...YUMMMM!  I will be making this again next week for sure!

I made this for my whole family, including my father who would never willfully eat ground turkey or pumpkin.  Before he ate it, we told him it was "just chili".  He ate it and loved it!  Afterwards, we told him what was in it.  He was shocked! He said it tasted like "regular chili" to him.

We enjoyed this but made a few changes.  We didn't use any bell peppers. We added a can of kidney beans and 2 C chicken broth, and used ground chicken instead of turkey.

I think it needs some more spices and less chili.  The flavor is so close to being amazing...It just is missing a little something.

Hmmmm - interesting.  I didn't dislike this, but it didn't wow me either.  I did not have diced tomatoes so I used crushed and then just added my own fresh tomatoes.  I also added a can of kidney beans and a can of chicken broth because it was so thick.  I made this in the crock pot on high for about 2 1/2 hours.  It was different but not something I'd make again.

Great base but if you have never made chili, but have eaten a lot of chili, this will disappoint you. It definitely needs more spices, as well as beans or corn(IMO). I probably tripled the spices, added cumin, hot sauce, a tad bit of curry, hot peppers, and 1/2 a can of tomato paste to give it some more flavor/zing. So for you chili-lovers, I would use the pumpkin as an inspiration but use your imagination or tried and true chili recipe as a base.

Not 5 stars only because I changed the original recipe per the other reviews - fabulous base recipe.  We were having a decent number of people over for a Halloween/birthday party (24) so, I doubled the recipe.  For the spices I used 3 small onions, 10-12 garlic gloves (chopped in mini food chopper), 3 generous TBSP chili powder, 2 tbsp worcestershire, 2 bay leaves, cumin and 4 cans of flavored diced tomatoes (basil & garlic) with the juice.  Also, I put some water (less than 1/4 of a can) in the cans to get all of the juice out & poured that in too.  No peppers, beans or corn due to dislikes (mine & husband's). Simmered it for a little bit in a large pot and then transferred to a crock-pot to keep warm, serve at the party. Had bowls of sour cream and sharp cheddar cheese on the side.  It was a HIT - we have none left. People were amazed when I told them there was pumpkin in it!!  It was not overly spicey which I think worked well given the large number of people with varying likes/dislikes.

I served this at a party and it was the hit of the night.  I didn't tell anyone what was in the chili, and they all, including my husband who doesn't think he likes pumpkin, RAVED about it!  They all said it was a do-again.  And, yes, I did tell them (not my hubby tho)the ingredients - they all want the recipe.  A hit!

This chili was so good. I did cheat and just add the package of chili spices. It was amazing.

This chili is awesome. I used ground beef instead of turkey, and added about a cup of beef broth and a can of corn to it. I also doubled the amount of seasoning and added red pepper flakes for some heat.The texture was really great though, and the pumpkin added a smooth, mild flavor.

This was a good start. I made the recipe as it is written. With a few tweaks it would easily be a four or a five star recipe. I think I will make this again because it is budget friendly, I would add more garlic and add more pumpkin, and kidney beans.

LOVE this.  I added lots more veggies (corn, black beans, an extra can of tomatoes) and some chicken broth and some tomato juice to get a little bit more "soup" out of the batch.  Because I bulked it up so much, I wished I had added more pumpkin to it, and I probably will next time.  This recipe is definitely going into heavy rotation as fall and winter approach! I ate it with some crusty bread and had a berry-based dessert for the perfect autumn finish!

This is such a good recipe! I did add some bbq sauce because it seemed a little bland to me, and I love bbq sauce in my chili! Used less peppers than called for, added carrots & celery. Only 1/2 lb of turkey and added a can of beans (why aren't there any beans???). Otherwise, perfect! We ate this chili with "Vegan Agave Cornbread Muffins" and reduced fat cheddar cheese on top of all. Heavenly!!!

This was just so so for me... I am an avid pumpkin lover and try any new pumpkin dish I can find.  The consistancy is very thick, and lacking in spice.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added extra chili powder, cumin, salt, 2 bay leaves and a dash of A1...  I also added water and chicken broth to make it more liquid.  It tasted pretty good and I love the health benefits of the added pumpkin.

Great place to start!  My previous chili's were always missing a slight "sweet" taste. Problem solved! Added a can chili beans, can of corn, cumin, Tastefully Simple's Fiesta dip mix for some heat, dash of liquid smoke, 1/2 cup Zing Zang bloody mary mix(#1 best ever Bloody Mary mix) and used Morningstar Farms veggie crumbles instead of turkey.  Great vegetarian recipe!

I loved this recipe.  I tried it verbatim the first time around.  It was okay.  The second time and from then on, I add black beans, corn, more veggies and whatever else floats my boat.  I let it simmer for approx. 45 minutes to tenderize all veggies.  This is a staple in my home and when I want to do something easy - this is where I go.  Thank you for posting this great recipe and all who have contributed in comments!

I just made this recipe for dinner and had to write a review right away because it was so delicious!  I added black beans and corn as others suggested, as well as a dash of sugar and cinnamon (which rounded out the pumpkin flavor nicely).  The recipe is simple and results in a colorful, hearty, healthy, unique chili.  I will be making this often!

I'm giving this a 5 because with the other reviewers' suggestions it turned out to be the best chili I've ever made.  I added a can of black beans, an extra can of diced tomatoes, a bunch of hot sauce, about 2 Tbsp. of Worcestershire, and extra chili powder.  The pumpkin makes it into a really thick sauce without it being "stew-y".  Great recipe!  I also made this with Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread from the site, and it turned into a fabulous meal.

This is really good.  I'd never have thought to add pumpkin.  Some changes I made are I omited the oil and onion, used a red pepper, added an extra can of tomatoes, only used about a 1/2 lb of turkey and added frozen corn and a can of red kidney beans.  I also kept adding chili powder until it tasted right and didn't serve with cheese or sour cream.  I couldn't really taste the pumpkin but I liked the consistency it gave the chili.

I've never made chili before, but made this (40 servings worth) for a pumpkin-themed baby shower. I added kidney beans, corn, and thinned it out with chicken broth because other reviewers said it was very thick - which it was! I needed to add a lot more chili powder, and I decided to throw in a little creole seasoning because it was very mild and I liked chili to have a kick. We served in pumpkin shaped bread bowls, and it was a hit!

Loved this chili recipe! I followed advice of other reviewers, adding some broth, more garlic, more of my own spices, and two cans of tomatoes with the juice. Also put in red kidney beans (drained). Found the pumpkin taste very mild, which was perfect for my family! A great way to incorporate hidden veggies into a family favourite!

I've never made chili before, but this was super easy & I thought tasted great.  I did add a can of corn & it would have been great w/ black beans but my husband doesn't do beans, so left those out.  This does make a really thick chili, so next time I would follow other suggestions of adding chicken broth to thin it out.  Otherwise, it is definately worth a try & the pumpkin is a really nice fall touch.

I added an extra clove of garlic, one can of kidney beans and a little bit of cayenne pepper to the original recipe. This is definitely one of my top five recipes and my husband loves it too. Another reason we love it is because you can throw everything in the slow cooker and come home to a delicious meal ready to go!

Curiously easy and delicious chili - now adopted by me for regular menu planning.  It went far and was VERY satisfying!

Not impressed with taste. The texture was very gloppy. However, I'm not a spicy food fan, so maybe I just don't like this stuff. 
I'd say give it a try, but not for me!

I made this with a kabocha pumpkin and ground chicken since turkey wasn't available, and it was awesome. I also added black beans, corn, extra tomatoes and some cumin.

I love this chili! VERY tasty, easy to make. I will agree with other reviewers -this recipe is a nice base, to tweak as you like. I used ground beef not turkey, cuz it was cheaper. I bought the tubs of pre-chopped red onion, and green and red bell pepper from the grocery store, cuz I hate chopping veggies. I also added a can of drained / rinsed black beans, which I enjoyed quite a lot. Like other reviewers I felt it was pretty thick and probably ended up adding about a cup of water. I also added 2 T of chili powder and will use more next time. I didn't even taste the pumpkin especially, it just helped give it that nice thick stew/chili consistency. And I don't know what the reviewer who said it was too sweet is referring to, unless they used pie filling, instead of straight pumpkin puree. LOVE this chili and will definitely be making it again. A nice fresh veggie taste, while still being a hearty cold weather soup. YUM. UPDATE: Nov 2, 2008 - this is one of my favorite recipes. I made it for a soup potluck at work recently and got rave reviews. I always add way more chili powder than is called for, just for my own taste. LOVE THIS RECIPE! LOVE IT! :)

The flavor was good but a bit on the sweet side.  I liked this recipe because it was different but I didn't care for the texture.  The turkey and pumpkin turned out a bit mushy after it was cooked.

I've made this recipe twice now, and it is a great hearty meal that's easy to make.  I usually don't like pumpkin, but I love this chili.  I doubled the garlic, added some hot sauce, and used a 12oz pack of veggie ground "meat" instead of turkey, and it worked out just fine.

this was REALLY good!  i added a can of black beans, chili beans and canned corn and whatever spices i had.  the pumpkin gives the chili a thick consistancy and packs on the nutrition.  this does not taste like pumpkin, though, and it's not supposed to.  (pumpkin is a relatively bland squash on its own).  will definitely make again!

My family loved this recipe, including my 11 year old son and my 8 year old daughter.  I added Adobo seasoning (from Penzeys) and a can of pinto beans.  It isn't too pretty to look at, but it tastes great!  I never would have thought pumpkin in chili would work, but it adds a nice flavor overall.

It was great, I did what others suggested. I added a can of black beans and a can of corn. And it did need liquid. That is why I gave it 5 stars. It was good. Loved it and suggest it to everyone.

Like a lot of other reviewers, I had to tweak this quite a lot.  It was so dry as written.  I added a 14 oz. can of no-salt tomato sauce and a can of black beans.  It was still very thick, but very good this way.  I added extra garlic, chili powder, and cumin.  I browned the turkey on the stovetop, and then threw that, along with everything else, in the crockpot and let it cook most of the day.  I used one green bell pepper and no yellow.  For the pumpkin, I made my own pumpkin puree from a small sugar pumpkin (it yielded exactly 2 cups).  Served with the cheese and light sour cream, and also chopped avocado (it needed to be used) and tortilla chips.  Very filling!!

Hmmmmm...........not bad.........not great........I'm really on the fence with this one.  My son thought it tasted "weird" but he's a picky eater so that didn't surprise me.  My husband thought it was "good" and ate his right up and took some for lunch the next day.  I thought it was just ok, but I just couldn't get used to the pumpkin taste.  I'm glad I tried it but I probably won't make it again.

I made this recipe omitting the onion and bell peppers. In their place I used a half bag of frozen corn and a can of black beans. I also used diced tomatoes that were seasoned for chili. Then I added some tobasco for a little kick. This was a great healthy alternative to red meat chili. My husband was turned off by the turkey when he saw me cooking but once he took a bite he was impressed.

Made this chili exactly as the recipe says to.  It was suprising good.  I wasn't sure about the pumpkin, but it added a nice texture to the chili.  The family liked it alot and couldn't believe there was pumpkin in it.  Very nice for fall.  Will make again for annual Halloween party!!

Thanks for the great idea. I, too used it as a base recipe and added some things to my liking. I added half a bottle of light beer, a cup of chicken stock, a few tablespoons of sugar, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, a few tablespoons of lime juice and some cumin. It was great.

I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was. I accidentally drained my tomatoes and added 1 tsp. salt, and used 1 can of pumpkin (I think about 1 1/2 cups). It was very thick, but good. It would make a great filling for tortillas.

We really enjoyed this.  I was nervous about it so i made a backup dinner and that went untouched.  WE gobbled this chili down.  I added black beans and corn and i wish i had some chilis to put in it.  I doubled the spices. As written its WAY too thick. I wonder if its a misprint.  I added a can of water and a sprinkling of chicken bouliion granules in place of a can of broth and it was still very thick.  Dh said this was a keeper and was disappointed that there wasn't any leftovers.

I though it was really decent tasting, however, like all the others I added my own touches (that's the nice thing about chili).  I added northern white beans, cayenne pepper, some random hot sauce I found in my fridge and A LOT more garlic.  When I make it again (and I know I will), I'll probably go with a mix of lean ground beef/buffalo and/or some sort of savory sausage.  I thought the turkey didn't give it enough depth.

We loved this great new chili - the pumpkin changed the consistency to a creamy, lighter texture. We like a bit of heat so my changes  are as follows --
Used 3 - 4 fresh tomatoes along with the Italian stewed tomatoes and their juice.  A cup of chicken broth, a  large can of white kidney beans and a good tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Additional spices - cumin, cayenne, hot pepper flakes and 3+ Tbs. chili powder.
Will certainly make again -- thank you Someoneswt for this excellent recipe.

I am giving this 4 stars because I made a lot of additions, but once I did it made a 5 star chili.  After reading other's suggestions and tasting as I went, I made the following additions.  I added a second can of tomatoes, a can of corn, and a can of cannelli beans.  Spices: salt and pepper, 3 Tbsp of chili powder, 2 tsp. of cumin, 1 tsp. of oregano, 1/4 tsp. of cayenne, and 2 tsp. of brown sugar.  We topped it with cheddar and sour cream. It was wonderful and the pumpkin is unrecognizable.  If you like your chili thick and hearty you will love this recipe.  For those who don't like it so thick, I suggest adding some chicken broth or water.

This chili wasn't really too bad actually.  The pumpkin was very subtle, you almost don't know it's there.  I didn't have chili powder, so I added more garlic & Italian seasoning.  It was a little thick so I added V8 juice & water.  I also threw in a can of white kidney beans.  I'll probably make it again, only next time with chili powder!

As is, this recipe is good.  A little tinkering and it could be better.  It looked like it would end up dry, but was not the case.  Had a yummy flavor, but not the punch of most chilies.  Next time I would add more chili powder, plus beans.  It was missing the kidney bean texture.

Delicious! At first I was a bit apprehensive because it looked pretty dry, but it really wasn't. I used ground chicken breast instead of turkey and also chipotle chili powder instead of regular chili powder, so it was quite spicy. Next time, I'll add a can of kidney beans.

Amazing! The pumpkin was subtle but gave the chili a very smooth texture. The only things I changed were I added one can of corn (drained) and just a teaspoon of cumin. I will certainly be making this again

The adults thought it was okay, and the children in the family were not having any of it. I tried the recipe because it sounded so interesting. I probably would not make it again, or if I do, I'll play around with the spices or something. It was fun, though, to try out something that is unique. Simple to make.

This was a very good healthy twist to the regular chili recipes.  I added a can of corn(drained) It added a nice extra crunch to the chili.  I also mixed in a little of the shredded cheddar.  Then sprinkled it on top & a spoonful of sour cream!  VERY YUMMY!!

Like other reviews said, this is a great base recipe to tweek to your own taste. It is very thick, so I added two cans of chicken broth. I also added i can of pinto beans. My son and I loved it .

This was a really good and easy recipe. As written the flavor is very subtle. As many other reviewers have hinted at: chili is not meant to be subtle. I did add more than a dash of salt (more like a couple teaspoons), doubled the chili powder, and added some cumin to boost the spice level. I also stirred in some leftover corn I had on hand and some fresh baby spinach. It would be good with another can of tomatoes and some kidney beans as well (unfortunately I didn't have any on hand). I rated this at 4 stars because it's a good base recipe: easy to make, very versatile (add or subtract ingredients according to taste), healthy, and creative. In a million years I would not have thought to put pumpkin in chili!

This was good - but nothing outstanding.  I tried to make as per recipe - but it was too tame.  After I added spices as per other reviewers, it was pretty good.  However, I'm not sure what I gained by adding pumpkin instead of standard tomato base.  Would make again if I wanted to get rid of some pumpkin - but there are so many other great pumpkin recipes to use puree in!

A real winner!  When I was making this recipe, I was worried that there was going to be way too much pumpkin in it, but it was wonderful!  I added red pepper, oregano, and some extra chili powder for extra flavor.  It was on the thick side, so I added some water as well.  Great for a student budget -- I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing!

The pumpkin added such a creamy richness to this chili.  It was however a bit bland.  I added cayenne and cumin.  I will definitely make again with suggestions of others.

5-stars with these modifications. Not a big fan of sweet peppers so I left those out but added black beans and more spice and it’s a great go to for lunches and dinners. One of my favs.

The first time I made it, I stuck to the recipe and it was good but I felt like it needed more.  Now when I make it, I add another can of tomatoes but with green chiles, a can of black beans, sweet corn, a dash of cumin, and a little bit of either chicken broth or orange juice to thin it out a little bit.   So good, hearty, and healthy!

Great base recipe. We added a few spices, cumin (quite a lot) and cinnamon (just a bit), next time I think nutmeg would work well. It does need extra salt. Heat is a personal choice, we added some.  Wine is a good idea, as is some vegi broth. Oh and a can of corn added a nice touch.

This is really good.   I make my own chili powder because I don't like the heat in chili (4 tsp of smoked paprika, 1/2 t of each garlic and onion powder, 1/4 t oregano, 1/4 cumin).  Instead of a can of tomatoes, I used 3 fresh tomatoes.   Also, I used 1 can of Farmers Market organic pumpkin.

Love the addition of the pumpkin for a unique flavor and heartier chili, but the original recipe is a bit bland.  Added 1 can each black beans and kidney beans (rinsed), 1 can plain tomato sauce, 4 oz can of green chilies, 2 cups chicken broth, 1 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. Worcestershire, and a dash of cinnamon.

I liked this well enough that I will make it again.  I always vary recipes, using the one given as a suggestion.  With this one I added cumin, black beans and cannelloni beans.    I think I'd add extra spice next time.  I served with rice.

It was a good recipe. I agree with others and it was bland. I was able to give it some flavor by adding 4 tbsp dark brown sugar and 2 tsp liquid smoke to the pumpkin purée. I also added 3-4 tsp of cayenne and paprika while it was cooking. The second batch I made it very hot by adding 4 Carolina Reapers to the sautéed veggies and dried Carolina Reaper powder to the dry ingredients. Delicious!

This recipe is definitely lacking on its own but is a good base.  Thank goodness for reviews.  I followed the suggestions of others and added more chili powder, cumin, another can of diced tomatoes, and black beans. Didn’t have any corn on hand but if added I think this would’ve made this dish.

I've made this many time, but always tinker with the ingredients.  I generally add frozen fire roasted corn, 1 can of black beans, 2 tsp of cumin, a little more chili powder to taste, red pepper flakes, a little more salt, and a packet of hot chocolate (or a few chocolate chips or other small piece of chocolate).   I add a little chocolate to every chili I make - it is my secret ingredient to make it a little richer and balances the flavors.

I've been making this year after year, as my staple chili - love it!    I also tweak it by using more diced tomatoes, more chili powder, adding 1 cup low sodium chicken broth, adding kidney beans, and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I bake cornbread as an accompaniment.  EVERYONE raves!

This is the 2nd time I've made Turkey Chili, and for some reason, this time it was way too spicy. I added another can of diced tomatoes and some water, and that seemed to neutralize it. Now, it's delicious. I had 2 big helpings! Next time, I will add some canned corn though. I can't wait to have some more today!

Served this to a group of friends, and no one could guess the secret ingredient, although they all liked it.  I added Worcestershire sauce, seasoning salt, oregano, and paprika to kick up the flavor a bit. As written, it is NOT hot-spicy. I also strongly suggest adding 2 C of beef bouillon, or else it's far too thick.

It definitely is a good start to a great chili. I added 1-2 tsp nutmeg and 2 cups beef broth. The nutmeg really brings the flavors together.

My first time making this and super impressed for a different twist on chili. Pumpkin is for baked goods, coffee imo. I mostly kept to the original recipe while putting a twist on it from other reviews. I did the same process with the turkey, peppers, onions. Add a can of rotel peppers and onion, 2c pumpkin purée, corn, cinnamon, cumin, chili powder. (I visually measured in comparison to the pot of chili), black pepper, 2tbsp sugar.

Neded more to it than this calls for. Hence the 4 stars. But having pumpkin as the base was SO yummy. It's a very very subtle pumpkin flavor, but it thickens up the liquid to a really nice consistency. Added cumin, corn, and black beans for extra heartiness, then it's a 5 star chilli.

This is an excellent base recipe, and the pumpkin is something that I would never have thought of! Great way to add some extra nutrition to an already healthy recipe.

Because I like my chili a little "soupier," I added another can of diced tomatoes and some chicken broth, as well as a can of black beans and some cumin (just personal preference).

This has become my go-to chili recipe!

This was actually amazing. I can't believe how good it turned out because it was so simple and easy to make. I've tried other recipes that take several hours to get the same flavor this does in 20 minutes. Very impressed.

We love this healthy chili! The recipe is a great base to add your own creative touches to. I always add a can of black beans and a small bag of frozen corn. I also use a crockpot after I sauté the turkey. I just dump everything in and let it do the rest!

Great way to finish off leftover canned pumpkin; also substituted smoked turkey for the ground turkey and added a little rice. For seasonings, I used smoked paprika and white pepper. Very satisfying.

Following some of the other reviews on here, I added a can of black beans, some extra tomatoes, and corn to give it a little more substance. At that point, I had more ingredients than the pumpkin base could handle, so I added another 1.5 cups of pumpkin. I ended up spicing it with about 3 tablespoons of chili powder, 1.5 tablespoons of cumin, and several large shakes of smoked paprika. After cooking it for 25 minutes with all of this, it was fine. I certainly didn't mind eating it. But then I decided to add some nutmeg and a small dash of cloves and let it simmer on low for another couple of hours. At that point it became something I was happy to be eating.

I mainly use this as a base for my chili and it works great! I prefer to make it in the slow-cooker so I add more liquid(stock or water), cube some butternut squash and add beans. 

I also double the amounts of spices and add rosemary, but that's just my preference!

This chili is so delicious! Like a slightly spicy bowl of fall. I added 1tsp chipotle chili powder, 1T smoked paprika, and more salt. It is delicious with a slightly smoky, spicy finish.

I've made this twice now.  I live with a vampire, so I have to omit the garlic.  And my dear daughter claims to have a pumpkin allergy so I have to use sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin.  The 2nd time I made this, I added an extra tablespoon of chili powder and a half teaspoon of cayenne.  I think it really improved it.  I served it with pepper jack instead of cheddar that time, too.

It was too bland for us.  So I added the following to fix it:   15 oz tomato sauce, can corn, can pinto beans, 1 tsp of  cumin, oregano and  parsley. Then it was very good.

I too added one can of black beans and one can of corn to this. I also added cumin and cayenne pepper to spice it up a tad and it turned out lovely. I made it for a fall dinner party along with "Nana's Apple Crisp," and it was perfectly seasonal!

This was a good base recipe and I loved the addition of the pumpkin, however, I had to add a lot more seasoning and read the other reviews and decided to add corn and a can of black beans. I added some allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg like some reviews suggested. I also added about half a container of chicken broth. I would have given this 4-5 stars if I didn't have to double, triple, and quadruple to salt, pepper, and chili powder and add so many other spices to make it have flavor. It had close to no flavor with the amounts the recipe had.

I made the version that was in the magazine. It called for one cup each of green and either red or yellow bell peppers. I made it for my three grandchildren, ages 7, 5, and 4. Their mother was skeptical about their eating anything with that many vegetables, but they all loved it. I served it with taco chips so they could scoop it up with them. Huge success!

I wanted to try this for something different, it was good but not my favorite chili recipe. It's a nice change up and you can't taste the pumpkin. It has a bit of bland taste so I took advice of other reviews and added more chili powder, cumin, and chili beans. I like my chilie with more liquid so I added can of chicken broth. I,skipped the sour Cream and only sprinkled cheese on top.  Would make again for something different but won't be my go to chili recipe.

I made this for dinner and it was huge hit with everyone in the house. They asked me to make it again. I did take the suggestions of others. I did not use bell peppers since I am the only one who likes them. I added a can of corn and 3/4 can of chicken broth. I also used Cumin, honey, cinnamon, maple extract and nutmeg(because i like it sweet). My husband was shocked to learn there was pumpkin in it as it is such a stuble taste. He did comment that the hint of cinnamon was a great addition.

I made this on the stove the first time, and it was good but lacked a bit of flavor. The second time I made it in a slow cooker and it was amazing, and the flavors all really came out. Highly recommend cooking in a slow cooker.

I can't begin to count how many times I have made this recipe! It's truly one of my all time favorites. I don't think I've made it the same twice but there are core changes/additions I always include because  I give this dish a  Southwestern flair: a can of Rotel Hot Diced Tomatoes (they are HOT too and add the perfect amount of heat to my dish), a can of corn, and a can of black beans. It makes for a very chili! I've also made a vegan version using tofu crumbles. Also delicious!

Every time I make this, it gets lots of compliments. The turkey pumpkin combination really elevates this chili. I added extra seasonings per other reviewers suggestions to give it the zing our family likes.

Pretty good as-is (with the addition of sour cream and cheese), but I made a few adjustments. Add a few dashes of cinnamon as well as a sprinkle of onion powder. The pumpkin flavor was a little strong -- about half a can to 3/4 should be sufficient. Throw in some corn and beans and about half a cup of tomato juice.

Great starter/base recipe!  As other reviewers said, I added more spices (cumin, extra chili powder, paprika, and a little allspice) and added some corn.  I only used 1 cup (half can of Libby's 100% pumpkin) that I had leftover from making pumpkin chocolate chip muffins (also found on this site-- great recipe! )but would like to use the full 2 cups next time.  The whole family enjoyed this chili and I look forward to making it more when the weather gets and stays cool!

This is a great base for this Fall chili, but I add a few things to add more flavor and heat!  I sautee 1 large jalapeno with the seeds with the other vegetables and add a can of dark red kidney beans to the pot along with 1 1/2 cups of water.   I omit the seasonings listed here, and instead I add the mccormic chili seasoning packet, I also add a dash of ground cloves, about 1/2 a teaspoon of pumpkin pie seasoning, 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt, and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.  It makes this chili dish more flavorful with sweetness and spicyness.  :-)

I changed it up a little. I'm not a fan of peppers so instead, I added corn and pinto beans. I also probably added quite a bit more seasonings. SO great. My boyfriend ate the leftovers for three days straight.

This is a great recipe...the addition of pumpkin really gives it a superb flavor to what otherwise might have been bland. I, like other reviewers did include nutmeg and cinnamon b/c these spices further compliment this recipe.  Again its a great base recipe that can easily be tweaked to your personal preferences. For those of us with food allergies,  this recipe has enabled us to again have chili...and I think this is better than just the normal stuff due to the uniqueness of the ingredients.  Also, its simple to prepare!

What a great recipe, I would have given it five stars except you do have to tweak it for more taste. First of all make sure you do not buy super lowfat turkey, it has no flavor and there's nothing you can do to fix it so try to get a maximum of 93% lean. Then like other people say add cumin and if you like it red pepper. Every chili needs beans so add a can of your favorite, like kidney or pinto beans. I love it my kids love it their friends love it.

Our family loves chili and I made this for my family. They don't deal well with change, so hubby liked it. My adult son loved it.  It was slightly sweet with just a bit of heat. Wonderful!

This is a great base, but definitely needs more flavor.  I increased the chili powder to taste, and added a little cumin. I also added some roasted corn (just put a few ears of corn in the broiler and turn every few minutes if you don't want to grill them), and it turned out great!

Like most others, I found that this recipe was a great base/starter.  After initially reading through many other reviews I made numerous changes.  The chili, after many adjustments, was delicious.  We loved the final product.  I appreciate this base recipe and we love the adjusted meal!

Loved sprucing up the nutrition by adding pumpkin. My family of non-vegetable eaters never even suspected it had pumpkin and, of course, I never told them. My husband, who hates pumpkin with a passion, said it had the nicest flavor balance of any pot of chili I've ever made. It was all I could do to not bust out laughing. I did add a can of black  beans, a can of kidney beans, and some extra spices.

This was fantastic!!! We left out the sour cream and made it paleo. I used canned pumpkin so this was dry. I added a can of chicken broth, double the salt and chili powder triple the garlic and onion and tossed in a pinch of pumpkin pie spice. It didn't make it to the table we gobbled it down hanging over the stove!!!!!!

I made this recipe over the weekend and it was pretty good. I made a few additions for a more flavorful entree: 1) I cooked about 1-1/2 lb. of turkey sausage b/c it seemed like it needed more meat, 2) I sauteed the vegies in bacon grease for added flavor, 3) I added about 3 c. of chopped butternut squash and 3 medium hot chopped green chilis (and omitted the chili powder). Very tasty overall!

I'm not a big fan of chili, but this recipe was very good.  I did add more chili powder and cumin, as well as a well drained can of black beans (for more fiber).  The pumpkin helped thicken it.  I'll definitely make this again.  Very easy!

This recipe as written is really bland and thick as concrete. I doubled the chili powder, added a bay leaf, 1 tbsp cumin, 1 tbsp tandoori seasoning, 2 cups garlic chicken broth, & 1 can black beans. That made it taste pretty good. Oh, I didn't garnish with cheese or sour cream.

Took the advice of some of the reviews and used this recipe as only a base. To the original recipe I added jalapeno peppers, fresh diced tomato and fresh mashed pumpkin instead of canned, black beans, crushed red pepper, cumin, chili pepper, annatto, cayenne pepper, a little bit of vinegar and lemon juice. Amazing and spicy :)

Great recipes! Next time I will add more onions and a chile. The recipe says a dash of salt but I used more like a tablespoon. That will keep it from being bland. Also used Fage Greek plain yogurt to cut out some of the fat of sour cream. Thanks!

This is a fantastic chili recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added a can of chilies, corn and black beans, and they definitely added some depth and flavor.  I also put in a bit more chili powder than what was called for in the recipe, because we like our chili extra spicy.  Overall though, this recipe is a winner!

This chili is new, interesting, and quite tasty. I liked the use of pumpkin, and the peppers gave it a nice, sweet touch. I added about a cup of corn, a can of black beans, some cumin, red pepper flakes, used a 15 oz. can pumpkin, and added extra chili powder. I also use one can of crushed tomatoes and 1/2 can of stewed tomatoes, and orange peppers instead of the green. It was really great garnished with cilantro leaves. Thanks for the different, fall recipe that all of my family enjoyed!

I don't get this recipe. Using the original recipe resulted in something I would consider inedible, not good- not spicy- bad consistency. I ended up adding black beans, corn, brown ale and tons more seasoning. In the end, it ended up tasting almost exactly like a traditional chili because of all the doctoring.

A good recipe, however I had to do some tweaking. This recipe is a little bland. Here is what I did:  

I used one whole onion chopped it up, and sautéed it in 2 tbsp of salt free butter (real butter).
I replaced the green and yellow bell peppers with a 16 oz bag of Classic Vegetable Mix by Birds Eye.
I used 1.5 lbs of ground turkey (I recommend at least 2 lbs).
I used 1 (14.5 ounce) can of diced tomatoes with fennel and red peppers.
I used 2 (15 oz) can of pumpkin purée.
I replaced the chile powder with 1 (1.2 oz) package of chile seasoning.
I added pepper.

Now...mix everything together. Taste (it will be bland). Add the DESIRED amount of salt until the right flavor is reached.  (I took a container of salt and gently added salt, mixed, then tasted and kept repeating until the desired taste was reached).

This was much better than I was expecting.  I followed other reviewers and added a can of light chicken broth and a can of beans (white).  I happened to have a pkt of Durkee white chicken chili seasoning on hand so I used that for spice.  It smelled and looked wonderful while cooking and I ended up letting it simmer on low for about 3 hrs on the stove.  Normally I'd use my crockpot but it disappeared.  It's a mild chili but easy to spice up to individual tastes.  Will definately make again!

Great recipe!  I put in more peppers and onion than the recipe called for, as well as more chili powder (almost double).  I also added a can black beans and a can of corn.  The pumpkin made for a creamier chili than usual, which I greatly enjoyed!

3 stars, only because it needed so much tweaking. I love the idea of pumpkin in chili, but it needed so much more. Not enough spice in the least, and after taste-testing as written, I added more according to the recommendations of previous reviewers.

I never really make chili the same way twice, tweaking it based on what peppers and other ingredients I have on hand, so this was great for Halloween season!  I used a fresh cooking pumpkin that I roasted in the oven and then mashed.  the flavors of the chili are strong enough that the pumpkin didn't stand out or taste strange.  I was worried that canned pumpkin might be too sweet, but the fresh pumpkin blended right in as any squash or gourd would :)

I tested this recipe first as written and it was good.  Then I added another can of tomatoes with green chilies and some cayenne pepper (to taste) because I like more tomato taste and it was bit bland for me.  It was then very, very good.  I think if I add some beans, no one would even know that it had pumpkin or turkey.  This is a recipe that I will continue to make and tweak.  I love the healthiness of it.  It is a very good base recipe to suit to your own tastes.

This was delicious! It's a great starter recipe. I just added whatever fresh veggies I had in the fridge (like sliced carrots) and some canned veggies (like corn) and it was delicious.

I made this for a bunch of Okie pig farmers and called it Road Kill Chili so they'd give it a try...and they loved it!!!  Healthier version of chili is always a nice twist!  Served with hot sauce and jalapenoes so they could spice it up to their liking!

This is an interesting recipe with no flavor.  At first I was afraid of the pumpkin until I realized that the pumpkin is very subtle and doesn't add much flavor unless you look for it.  I added black beans, corn, cumin and taco seasoning.   It was great!  This recipe is great to build on.

I used everything but the cheddar cheese, I omitted it, instead I used parsley, It is really good with it if you want to make it low calories. Iused red curry and it was tasty. I used chicken instead do turkey, I think that without the meat you can work out a good  veggie soup.

Fantastic when tweaked. I added an extra can of tomatoes, a can of corn, a can of black beans, a can of pinto beans, a can of kidney beans, a can of green chiles and i sauteed a jalapeno with the onion and peppers and i put alot more pumpkin puree then called for. I put a little pit of nutmeg and cinnamon. I also just threw it all in a slow cooker and just let it go for hours. It was really really delicious it just needed more than was in the original recipe.

I love the idea of this chili, but it was definately too bland.  Next time I will make it hotter, and slightly less pumpkin--and I love pumpkin, but I couldn't taste anything else.  Will definately make it again, just modify it.

I'm sorry but this is probably one of the worst things I ever triied to make. Maybe it was the turkey or the pumpkin or the combo of the two.  It just didnn't taste very good at all. I'll never make it again.

I made this for dinner last night and it was AMAZING. I didn't measure exactly, but I had a pie pumpkin I wanted to use, so I cooked and pureed the flesh from that and used it in the chili. I also added in corn and red kidney beans (it's chili, right?) and left out the bell peppers because I didn't have any on hand, and just added what I wanted for seasoning without measuring. Fantastic recipe, thank you for providing it!

I would probably give this recipe 3 stars as written, and probably 4 stars with my changes. I doubled the diced tomatoes, doubled the spices and added crushed red pepper and more salt. I also added kidney beans, cilantro, more garlic and some veggie broth to thin the consistency a bit.  I loved the pumpkin in this recipe, and I'm curious to see how it would turn out if I were to omit the turkey and add more beans instead.

I really enjoyed this chili and took advice from previous reviews to add a few things. I used ground beef instead of turkey then added a can of corn and cannellini beans (had them in pantry) then added 1tsp of cumin, cinnamon, ground red pepper. I think next time I will use black beans and add more spices. Overall, thought this was very tasty and unique. Good way to use pumpkin.

Because my husband does not like cooked peppers, I omitted them.  I used cooked pumpkin that had been ground up in a food processor.  I found it to be a little bland (probably due to no peppers) so I added some garlic & onion powder.  I also added some white kidney beans.  I though it was ok, but my son loved it.

My husband and young adult son loved this (me, too!)  It was tasty, easy to make and very healthy. I'll make it again for sure. I did add some cinnamon, coriander and cumin- one can add spices to their liking.

I used only 1/2 lb ground beef (didn't have turkey) and a little more than a cup of pumpkin, plus a can of kidney beans for more liquid. It was pretty good, but only with the sour cream mixed in.

This was very good.  I did add some stuff to it - cumin and more chili powder and some crushed red pepper (I like things spicy).  I also threw a few diced jalapeño pieces on top.  Was very yummy!

GREAT!  I added black beans, corn, more chili powder, some cumin, and some chopped cubanelle peppers for a mild heat.  Definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed this, I know a lot of the reviews here said that it wasn't hot enough, but it was hot enough for me!  I used 1 cup of green pepper instead of 1/2 of green and 1/2 of yellow.  I will definitely make it again!

First of all it was very bland and so I had to add this and that just to make it palatable.  I added more liquid in the form of another can of diced tomatoes,also added chicken broth because this receipe was like a casserole instead of soup. I added cumin, corriander, cilantro, more salt and pepper and more chile powder.  I added a little sugar as well.  In the end.....it was much better than the original recipe but not worth making again.  Basically I think I did everything in order to get rid of the Pureed pumpkin.  Regular chile is much better than this.

Excellent and easy!  I was unsure about the pumpkin, but it adds a nice flavor.  My in-laws were surprised about the pumpkin.  My husband liked the spice.

i did this just once, and it was amazing. i read the previous reviews, and saw that it needed something a bit more. so on top of what is in the ingredients, i added 1 large jalapeno, a can of corn, a can of black beans, an extra can of diced tomatoes, some cilantro, 3 cloves of garlic, some cumin and a little more chili powder. i was pleasantly surprised with the results from the suggestions given. it may be a little spicy for some, but thats what the sour cream and cheddar cheese is for. thanks for this recipe

Pretty delicious idea, though I can't give the recipe itself 5 stars since I basically just added a can of pumpkin to my own turkey chili (which includes beans and corn and way more spices). I do appreciate the innovative use of pumpkin!

I followed this recipe to the T...but I still wasn't a huge fan.  I saved this sometime last year to try when the season chili came back around...but I really didn't like it.  I found myself digging for the sour cream because that's what gave it it's flavor.  Without the sour cream, it was pretty bland, which was a waste of my fresh ingredients.  I won't be making this again.

Unique seasonal recipe! I agree that it needs more seasoning. I only added 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin and regret it. Add all the pumpkin asked for because its not overwhelming at all! I will make this again for sure.

awesome recipes and I like that it's different. :) I only gave it 4 stars because it was a little bland for me on it's own, but with the addition of lots of extra chili powder, more garlic, some applewood smoked black pepper,and a can of black beans, it was great! I also added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce to thin it out becuase it was really thick and I was out of diced tomatoes. All together this is by far one of my new fav chili recipes :)

This was ok. I agree with others that this was rather bland even after adding more chili powder, some cumin, and red pepper. I also really missed that hearty tomato flavor that comes with traditional chili. Overall not bad just not something that I would go out of my way to make again. Sorry

I didn't have ground turkey so I used a package of Johnsonville Sweat Italian sausage in the recipe and did not put the bell peppers as we like them but they don't like us..... I through in a can of corn, diced mushrooms and zucinni.  I turned out very thick and yummy! WILL make this one again!

This was quite good and a great way to use my pumpkin puree.  The pumpkin contributed a subtle flavor that added depth and thickness to the chili (I like to eat my chili with a fork).  I made it virtually as is, except that I substituted garlic salt as I was out of fresh garlic, and I threw in some mushrooms I had in the frig.  I will definitely make again and will probably add more ingredients per some of the other reviewers' suggestions.

I Loved this!!! I used pumpkin pie filling so my chili was a bit sweet. Took a couple suggestions from the comments and added the bay leaves and chili flakes. Made a very good flavor! Also added corn and black beans.   A friend couldn't find pupkin so she used sweet potatoes. She loved it as well!

My family loved this!!! I only made two small changes. It seemed a bit dry, so I added 1 extra can of tomatos and I added 1 can of black beans. My kids never finish their supper and they came back for seconds! My husband ate 2 giant bowls! Thanks for the great recipe!

This chili turned out really great! But I actually couldn't find any pumpkin at my grocery store, so I used one can of candied yams and one canned unsweetened. I also used most of the suggestions made by others on here...turned out really good with a little sweet/hot aftertaste. Loved it. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I loved it, but my husband didn't.  He said it was bland and needed alot of spice.  My 20 month old daughter loved it.  The only modifications I made was I did BOCA meatless ground crumbles instead of ground turkey.  That made it very easy.  It worked out great.

This had a good basic structure, but I ended up adding a lot of different things along the way. I added roasted garlic, pumpkin pie spice and chipotle chili powder. I also added some frozen corn so give it some texture. Also, before serving, I crushed up tortilla chips and put them on the bottom of the bowl, then put the chili on top with the sour cream and cheese.

Wonderful and kid friendly!  I made it exactly as described and it came out fantastic. It is always a hit.  It is even better with fresh pumpkin puree...Thanks!

Really innovative idea to add pumpkin to chili, or stews in general.  It gave the dish a thick texture that's akin to using potatoes but without the resulting grittiness of broken down bits of potato - this texture is much smoother.  The taste of the pumpkin is pleasant and fairly faint.  As written, I think the texture would be too thick, especially since I added in a whole bunch of collard greens (very good addition, by the way!) and whole baby organic carrots, so I added an additional 2 cups of chicken broth and used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  I left out the sour cream and cheese as the dish had enough taste on its own.  Normally, I like stews after they've had a few days to infuse flavors together, but for this one, I think I actually preferred it the day of cooking.  Big kudos on the pumpkin idea!!

I made this in a slow cooker with diced steak and a cup of dried beans, and added a couple cups of water to keep it from drying out while cooking. Cooked it on high for eight hours, and it came out with just the right texture- I did cut the chili down a little too because of personal preference. This was a great chili that is easier on my stomach than traditional versions, so I will definately be making it again soon. Thanks for a great recipe!

A little bland for my taste but I do love that the pumpkin adds nutrients and thickens the chili without being an overwhelming flavor.  My husband didn't know it was in there until I told him.

Good combination of ingredients. Needs a little more spice. I added cayenne pepper to give it a little more kick.

i will make this again w/ the changes i made. i used a 28 oz can of tomatoes according to the reviews and the consistency was just right for us. i also added some pinto beans.  i keep a taco seasoning mix on hand so i added the equivalent of 1 packet. i still ended up adding cayenne. if you like flavorful chili you will need to REALLY increase the heat. i think the pumpkin masks it.  i was very surprised that you couldnt even tell the pumpkin was in there. a great idea to use up some of the pumpkin puree in my freezer

I recommend adding corn, carrots, and kidney beans. This makes it so filling and delicious. This recipe is fantastic, and so wonderful for winter. We make it once a week since discovering it, and it's always welcome! Adding sour cream and chives is NOT OPTIONAL! You MUST eat it that way... it makes all the difference.

I love this chili, after I make the following changes (too bland & thick otherwise):  Add - 1 can chicken broth, 1 can black beans, 1 can kidney beans, 1 can diced tomato (2 total), 2 tbls Cumin, 1/2 tsp cayenne, 1 can diced green chilies.  All of it goes into the crock pot where the perfect chili is created!

This was tasty! Needs quite a few modifications for my tastes, though. How can you have chili without beans? I added a can of kidney beans, a can of corn, lots more chili powder, lots of cumin, some sriracha sauce (we like our chili SPICY!), barbecue sauce, and a bit of peanut butter. Sounds weird, but is actually very good and very spicy. If you try the peanut butter, don't add too much! It can very easily overpower everything. ANYWAY, I love pumpkin and it really made the texture wonderful in this chili -- nice and thick. Will make this again next October, when I get a craving for everything pumpkin. :)

Due to a shortage of pumpkin at the local grocery store, I substituted mashed canned sweet potatoes for the pumpkin. It turned out fabulous! I will definitely make this again- I'd love to try it with the pumpkin. I recommend this substitution, though, even if you can find the pumpkin!

I used red and yellow bell peppers, and a can of Rotel chiles and tomatoes, as well as the can of regular diced tomatoes.  However, I was using pumpkin puree from a sugar pumpkin and it yielded more than 2 cups.  Tasted better the next day after the flavors had a chance to blend.

I loved the chili. I especially like that I can use frozen pureed pumpkin.  The pureed pumpkin made the chili very thick which I really like. I left out the onions and peppers my husband is allergic to onions and doesn't like peppers. I then added an equal amount of corn instead. I also added 1tsp of cumin and  1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I don't know if canned pumpkin has salt added to it but since I do know the pumpkin I cut up and cooked down doesn't have any salt I chose to add salt to the chili. I didn't measure the pumpkin I used. I just cut up enough pumpkin to fill up the pot I was using and then cooked it down untill it was to the  desired consistency. This way I just used one pot for the whole process. I also used leftover turkey instead of the ground turkey. Thank you for a wonderful recipe I will use many times.

The idea is a 5-star recipe ... it's full of fiber and lean protein.  I gave it 4 stars because I had to suit it to my taste.  My secret to making it perfect was adding milk.  I loosely followed one of the other reviews and added a can of corn, a can of black beans, another can of tomatoes, a can of chicken broth, a couple Tbsp of honey, cilantro, cumin, and pumpkin pie spice.  It was still just a little "off".  So I added a big pinch of kosher salt and about a half cup of whole milk.  The whole milk did it.  It helped take it from a thick pumkin-y taste to a creamy & yummy taste.  Even my husband liked it.

Very good base recipe to improve on!  I did add alot of things the other reviewers suggested.  My hubby said it's a keeper, which is something I don't hear often when trying a new recipe!  He was really suprised when I told him there was pumpkin in it.  It is much more filling too than regular chili!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great base to start with but very bland. I added fresh chopped cilantro, 8 oz. can corn, 1/2 tsp. cumin, red pepper flakes and a few more dashes of salt. With those items added it was 5 stars delicious and we will make it again.

I love how healthy this is, not to mention easy to toss together. I used 4 pre-shaped (raw) turkey burgers and crumbled them (on sale!) and added a can of chiles, along with lots of other spices (chili powder, crushed chipotle red pepper, cayenne to name a few.) While I do like the taste, the "mushy" factor is what brings my rating down (though what do you expect w/2 cans of pumpkin, I know : ) A great recipe for my own eating, but not something I'd serve to company based on unappetizing appearance. GREAT way to use up extra canned pumpkin!

This recipe is very interesting.  Very bland at first.  You definately need to add much more than the called for amounts of seasoning.  The flavor was good after much tweeking, but we couldn't get past the texture.  This turned out very thick and creamy.  It reminded me of mashed potatoes that had been over whipped.  Next time, if there is a next times, I will only use about a quarter of the pumpkin.  Very creative, but not the best.

Oh my gosh. Probably my favorite chili recipe ever (after I doctored it). The recipe by its self is too bland. I added a ton more chili powder, salt and pepper, and I also added cumin and little coriander. Very yummy. The pumpkin gives it a nice rich hearty flavor!

I made this for my boyfriend the other night and he loved it. I followed other readers' recommendations by adding a can each of corn, black beans, and green chilies, a can of tomato juice, and adding a generous dash of cumin and red pepper flakes. This is a very easy weeknight dinner and I will definitely make it again!

This is a really good healthy chili!  I love the fact that there are no beans and the pumpkin makes it the perfect consistency.  I made this dish for a chili cookoff at work and it was a big hit!

Loved it.  I added like suggested the cumin, chili powder, and cinnamon, and allspice.  Thin it out with chicken broth.  Taste great!

This looked intriguing; I'm always on the lookout for "different" chili recipes (I'm not much of a red meat person). I agree with other readers that it was a little bland, but I had some leftover pinot noir, so I added about 1/4 cup and a shake of Tony Chachere's to thin it down some and add a little "poo-yie"!. It was better the next day; the flavors had a chance to blend more. I'd up the chili powder and other seasonings just a bit, depending on personal taste. All in all, a good recipe to experiment on.

I actually made mine vegan, so instead of using turkey I added a can each of black beans, chickpeas, and kidney beans and some celery.  I served it out of a hollowed-out pumpkin (allowing guests to add their own sour cream and cheese) at my scary movie party and it made for the most beautiful chili ever.  This is definitely a new staple.

I found the original recipe to be incredibly bland.  I doctored it up quite a bit... more chili powder, some cumin, cinnamon, a few spoonfulls of the sauce from a can of chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, and more salt.  With the fixes, I would definitely make it again.  The pumpkin is a nice touch.

This was good but I had to keep adding spices to it because it was bland. I also added black beans and corn to it. It came out really thick and I wish I had either bought an extra can of tomatoes or some chicken broth. I didn't have either so I added some of the juice from a jar of jalapenos.

Super easy to make. After reading the reviews, I added a can of diced green chilies and some habenero tobasco sauce to give it a little bit of kick. Great flavor!

This is EXCELLENT!  I took another reader's suggestion and added black beans, corn and cumin - for those skeptics out there, you can't even taste the pumpkin, but it definitely gives it that "something extra" and the texture is hearty and comforting.  I like my chili on the spicy side, so will add some cayenne pepper next time.  ENJOY!

I gave it 4 stars bc i did added other things to it. I added one can chili beans, one black beans *drained, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 1 can of tomato sauce, little can of green chilies, 1 can of pumpkin, 1 whole green pepper (i didn't have any yellow pepper), about 1.5 TBSP of cumin, alot more chili powder, 2 shake of pumpkin pie spice, couple shake of cayenne pepper and chicken broth to thin it out (it's really thick. I brought it into working in a crockpot and they ate it all up. My coworkers thought it was really good. A twist of fall to the normal chili. I would definitely make it again. Maybe throw a jalapeno for some kick.

This looks SO good - I love turkey, and I love pumpkin. I love comfort foods on a cold day, especially when they can be made healthy, and I love Mexican/Tex Mex/Southwestern food. But I hate tomatoes and bell peppers! I'm seriously ready to cry over here...I want to try this so bad. I'll work on substitutions. 5 stars for tempting me to tears ;)

I have rated this reciped based on my additions as well. But regardless, it's a great dish that tastes amazing! I used yellow and orange bell peppers because I find them sweeter and juicer. I took the suggestion of adding cinnamon as well as adding some chicken stock so the chili could simmer properly without blowing chili chunks all over my kitchen; and this was after I retained the diced tomato juice. I also added some apple wine in it....mmmmm. My boyfriend even like this dish and he is a very particular eater.

This is a perfect family chili. Not too spicy for kids, but with enough flavor to satisfy the adults. And it only improved as leftovers! I usually don't make these sort of novelty recipes more than once, but I'm already planning our second meal with this chili as the main dish. Excellent!

Really excellent - perfect for a winter meal. The pumpkin isn't an obvious flavor in the dish, but definitely adds something. If you have the time, bake a pumpkin and make your own puree.

This was just okay for us. I made it as stated, but then I started adding some more spices because it was just a little to "pumpkin" for me, and I was worried about my hubby not eatting it at all.  I added some more chili powder, garlic powder, red pepper flakes and some smoked chipotle pepper seasoning.  With the additions, it was good, but not a FAVORITE That would keep cycling in the normal rotation. Thanks though!

Wow, way better than I expected. I was a little nervous since everyone I told abou the recipe gave me a yuck face. I made it exactly as is and LOVED IT. I really don't like spicy stuff, so a normal person I suspect would want to add more spice. Now that I've made the recipe as is, I'm going to try some of the suggestions of corn, black beans and cilantro. Yummy!

I loved this.  I don't know what I was expecting, but I love pumpkin & I make almost everything with ground turkey, so it sounded perfect.  I did alter one thing & added black beans as suggested by another reviewer.  I thought the spicing was great.  My boyfriend didn't even know there was pumpkin in it.  It was a little thick, but not in a bad way.  A surefire hit!

Yum!  I can't give it five because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  However, I know that it is a great idea!  I used buffalo meat, added a can of chili beans, a small can of tomato sauce, some brown sugar, (I like my chili sweet) and about a 1/2 cup of water.  I also used a package of chili seasoning mix,  But it was great!  It doesn't taste like pumpkin but the texture is sooooo creamy, a real comfort food!  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for a great idea!

Great recipe to have something different than your same ol' chili. I add on top of this recipe 1 finely diced jalepeno and 1 can northern beans to this and wow... big hit!!!

My family loved this. I made a few changes--but it was still awesome--(1) used ground chicken instead of turkey (2) used 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes instead of smaller can of diced (3) added more chili powder (to taste); added cumin to taste (4) added a can of corn. Also was kinda thick so at the end I added a little fat free half and half. Served with baked lays scoops tortilla chips on top. Yums!

I think this is a great base recipe, but like other reviewers, I added other ingredients to my own liking. Mexicorn, chili beans, black beans, chicken stock, paprika, cayenne, salt, pepper, etc...you really couln't taste the pumpkin in this, but it did lend a slight sweetness to this spicy chili. Will definitely make again!

Very good but also added some things like suggested - an extra can of tomatoes and some frozen corn. Also I thought a touch of cinnamon helped bring out the pumpkin flavor.

Blech! Not for me. I even tweaked this recipe with the others suggestions. I found it to be tangy and bitter. Make the pork chili instead. It is amazing!

As others have said, this recipe is a good starting point. It is very bland as it is written. I used about 2 tbsp of chili powder, 2 tsp of cumin, 2 tsp of allspice, and 1 tsp of seasoning salt. (After the measurements of the original recipe, I stopped measuring and seasoned to taste.) I had two turkey breasts in the freezer. So, I chopped them and browned with the ground turkey. I used about 2 cups of chicken stock to thin the chili to a consistency I liked. I also added a few handfuls of frozen corn and a can of black beans. With these changes, this was a delicious chili.

This is okay, but I couldn't taste the pumpkin at all and I prefer my regular traditional chili recipe I think.  Had to double the spices and add some red peppper flakes to give it some heat.

At first, I wasn't too sure what to expect. What a fantastic surprise! The pumpkin was a delicious addition to one of my fave dishes. It was thicker than what I'm used to, but still very tasty. I will definitely make this again!

This receipie was very good. I changed a few things and added my own changes. Instead of using regular pumkin puree, I used a can of Libby's Pumkin Pie mix [because I had it]. I also used a pack of chili seasoning. I wanted a hearty chili, so I added 1 can each of light kidney, dark kidney and pinto beans. I also added cumin and a few dashes of paprika. I served it over plain macaroni. It turned out REALLY well. I will be using this through the fall.

This was great.  My kids like a mild chili, so I used only part of the chili powder. I did add 1 can of chicken broth to make the chili a little thinner. We played a game to try and guess the "secret" ingredient, and no one could come up with it!  Thanks for the recipe.

I don't know about anyone else, but, I made this recipe and we all thought it was WAY too thick!  I think we could have used forks....?!?  Is it missing an ingredient to make it more liquid?  Maybe chicken broth or something.  Won't make this again.

The taste was "chili," but the texture was too smooth. Not the best chili recipe but I suppose it's healthier.

The first time I made this I accidentally used Libby's Easy Pumpkin Pie Mix instead of plain pumpkin. It was FANTASTIC and eliminates the need for any additional seasoning. I also doubled the amount of peppers and added more chili powder than the recipe calls for. It's such a unique way to use pumpkin--the flavors really compliment each other well.

This is a delicious sweet and savory chili. The pumpkin makes it creamy without having to add any milk. I would follow other reviewers comments to add additional spices and ingredients to the recipe. I added coriander, ground cloves, cilantro, white corn, extra can of diced tomatoes, chicken broth, and a small amount of orange juice.

I thought this was pretty good.  My husband LOVED it, and he's harder to please than I am.  So I'm sure I'll be making this one again.  The pumpkin really thickens the chili and adds a nice sweetness to it.  Thanks!

This chili is wonderful, with a very different flavor than other chili recipes.  Perfect for a fall or winter day.  Served with a green salad, it makes a great meal! I've made it several times and served to my family and company and always get compliments on it.  I have made it as listed, and have also varied with what I have on hand (all green peppers, for ex, instead of a mix of yellow and green) and it has turned out well every time.

Very good! I did not add in the oil.  I added in 8 ounces of tomato sauce and 8 ounces of water.  W/o the sour cream and w/o the cheese, this drops it to 170 calories a serving -- Not bad!  My boys even gobbled it up.  I don't like spicy foods, so this was really good.  My husband added a dash of habernero sauce and it was perfect for him.

I left out the bell peppers, added a can of black beans and, for spice, used a cocoa chili mix. I was really pleased with the way it turned out.

Made this for a chili cook off at work and came in second. Wanted to make something for those who don't eat beef, they loved it! The texture was hard for me to handle, added a can of tomato sauce because it seemed too thick, also added more spices as suggested by others. Will make again and play with the recipe.

This was a good chili, and although I love pumpkin, I have to say it was little odd having it chili. The flavor was subtle, but when you get a taste, it's... different.

Everyone raved about it! The pumpkin truly gave the chili a rich and warm flavor! This recipe is a keeper but feel free to make it your own by adding your favorite ingredients and spices!

Who would ever think to add Pumpkin as a base for chili?? But this was so rich and good. The pumpkin adds a nice rich creamy subtly sweet base that makes the chili taste so good. My partner and I have chili cook-offs to see who can come up with the best chili recipe for dinner and tonight I won! Thanks for this.

DELICIOUS!  I added an extra can of diced tomatoes as well as kidney beans, white beans, and pinto beans.  Perfect!!!  Even my 14 yr old brother who won't eat vegetables gobbled it up and went back for seconds!

A wonderfully healthy and filling meal!  Definitely make sure to add spices to your taste.  We liked the spiciness straight from the recipe though.

This was quite good and easy to make. I took other reviewers advice and added double the chili powder, almost 2 tbs cumin and added cilantro at the end. I think it still needed a little something, but a solid recipe I would make again. And while the pumpkin gave it a nice richness/thickness (oh, I added a can of corn, black beans, and an extra can of diced tomatoes), I think I'll throw another can in next time because I couldn't really "taste" the pumpkin per se.

I agree it is a great base.  My sis and I both made batches of this and spiced it up using things like black beans, spicy V8, and jalapenos.

Great chili!  I liked how it wasn't too spicy -- the hubs can't deal with spicy food.  I made a couple of adjustments.  I added 1 tbs of pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and then about a cup of chicken stock to thin it out.  LOVED the flavor!

This is really good! I only gave it four stars because I had to make some modifications to get it up to speed. I took the hints offered by others, namely, doubled the pumpkin (I used one of the ginormous cans), petite diced tomatoes (another ginormous can), added a can of corn (drained), and a can of black beans. I used 3 and a half tablespoons of chili powder, 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire, and about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes. I also added two bay leaves, and almost a full can of chicken stock. I didn't have much of that left over, so I suppose I could have used the whole can. Everything else was pretty much as the recipe calls for, but I did let it simmer 30 minutes instead of 20. I chose to use a yellow bell pepper and an orange bell pepper to go along with the autumnal theme. I also didn't have to drain the initial saute, since the turkey had so little fat. But I did transfer it at that point to a Dutch oven before adding all of the other ingredients. I'm glad I did because it would never have fit in the skillet! Thanks to the advice I got from other reviewers, it had just the right amount of bite, and just the right consistency. I would totally make this again.

I made this for dinner last night and it turned out great!  I made double the recipe so we can have chili dogs on Friday night.  This recipe is perfect for chili dogs because it's nice and thick.  I did make a couple of adjustments after reading the suggestions.  I added black beans and corn plus and extra chili powder.  Although I doubled the recipe, I only added enough pumpkin for one recipe.  I also added some beef stock along with the tomatoes.  This gave it some added flavor.  I will definitely make this again and probably tweak it some more - maybe add beer and chipotles next time!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was good and easy.  It seemed a bit bland without some additional ingrediaents, so I also added a few things like others: 1 tsp cumin; 1 can white northern beans; 1/4 cup maple syrup; tomato sauce.

I agree with some of the other reviewers - this is a great base recipe. I didn't even notice when I first looked at it but there are no beans. I'm used to beans w/ my chili! I added corn, black beans,green chiles and upped the seasoning a bit - I like my chili spicy. I also simmered for about an hour.

Five with some easy adjustments (most cooks adjust every recipe they see!):

I had a hankering for fall foods and made this chili this afternoon.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and doubled up on the tomatoes, added beans (I did kidney), and didn't skimp on seasonings such as garlic, cumin, cilantro, and chili seasoning.  I also added ~1.5 Tbl honey.  I used turkey sausage, rather than plain ground turkey.  For the pumpkin puree, I cooked a whole golden nuggest squash (looks like a small pumpkin) in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes.  I then cut it open into chunks and scooped out 1/2 of the meat of the squash and pureed with a cup of chicken broth.  I let the whole mixture cook on low on the stove for the afternoon (great aroma), and served topped with shredded cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and buttered sourdough bread on the side.  Next time, I'll add more beans and 1/2 lb to 1 lb more turkey.
 
Hubby said it was "terrific", "awesome", and "really good".  The kids were leary of the big chunks of tomato (you could puree if yours are picky) and the idea that I put "pumpkin" in it, but both filled their bellies with the chunks of turkey and everything that stuck to it.

I thought this recipe was "just OK".  I started making it exactly as printed, but I was too frugal to buy yellow peppers.  I just used the green.  I got everything listed into the pot, but felt that it wasn't spicy enough, and it didn't have enough tomato.  I added another tablespoon of chili powder, and a small can of tomato sauce.  

My husband likes a thick chili, and he really enjoyed this.  I felt that the texture was weird.  I just couldn't get past the mushy texture of the pumpkin.  It was edible, but I won't be making it again.

Great recipe!! I'm usually not one to alter a recipe because I'm scared I'll mess it up, but I did add light red kidney beans and a little bit of cumin and nutmeg.  Since I have a VERY difficult time cutting onions because my eyes are so sensitive, I was able to buy diced tomatoes with onions already in the can! (saves a step).  Hope everyone enjoys this as much as I did!

Best chili ever!  I submitted it in a chili cook-off against my brother-in-law's famous chili, and this won!  It's our favorite!  Very healthy, easy, and great warmed up.  You could add just about anything.  We don't use bell peppers (because we don't like them), and we add black beans and red kidney beans.

What a great recipe.  These unusual ingrediants actually look and taste remarkably like traditional chili, but a much healthier alternative.  I changed nothing; it works great just as is.

What an awesome chili recipe!  I usually don't like chili unless I cover enough of it with sour cream.  The pumpkin must tame down the spices and it doesn't taste like pumpkin at all.  I followed some suggestions and added a can of corn, extra clove of garlic and used a pkg of chili seasoning for convenience instead of the separate spices.  This is great for kids (I have 4 who loved this!) and people who prefer non-spicy foods.  I served with a small scoop of sour cream and a few chips.  YUM!

Really need to add the extra spices - very bland without.  I added extra chili powder, cumin, and taco seasoning.  Then it was really good.  Next time I will add beans and/or corn per the other reviews.

I took some of the suggestions and added black beans and corn an extra can of tomatoes, and more chili powder and cumin.  I loved it!  My husband does not like exotic things (pumpkin, pineapple, etc) in his food, and he did not come home for dinner, so the jury is still out...

As is, this recipe was a little lackluster for my taste.  I made it a FIVE-STAR by doubling the chili powder, adding one teaspoon of coriander and one teaspoon of cinnamon, as well as extra salt to taste.  After the 20 minute simmer, I took the pot off of the heat and stirred in one-half can of coconut milk.  This gave it a deliciously creamy texture, perfect to serve over rice.  YUM!

A great healthy and quick meal. I took some of EMT's advice too by adding the worcestershire sauce, taco seasoning and corn although I added kidney beans and about 1 1/2 cups beef broth because that's what I had on hand. Along with the cheese and sour cream we put a few Fritos and avocado chunks on our chili.

I'm going with 5 because I find it very 
creative as some of the other reviewers said.  But I do agree it needs TLC in the spice dept. depending on your taste.
I added 1/2 tsp. Cayenne pepper, 1 Tsp Tony Chachere's, a couple pinches of cumin and tumeric, a pinch of sugar and a spoonful of honey, a can of white beans,
a can of corn and half a can of tomato paste.  Then salt and pepper to taste. I'm a spice nut so I added a ton and it had a major kick!  I LOVED it!! It's on the menu for my next cold weather get together!  I also left out the green pepper, cheese and sour cream. And added 3 cloves of garlic.. =) But it was all worth it.. such a neat recipe! A good one to have some fun with!

Since I don't like the acidity of green peppers, I substituted red peppers and added a jalapeno for some zing. A can of yellow hominy gave it more texture and another fun color. 
I also like to play with spices, so I added some cumin and cinnamon and it was delicious!
Finally, since I'm looking to lose some weight, I omitted the cheese and sour cream. It's a nice hearty stew-like chili and I didn't miss them.

My girlfriend and I loved this recipe. We altered it a little bit. We cheated and used McCormick's chili spice mix. I also used two can's of diced tomatoes. We added a can of corn which added a great consistency. Finally, we subbed veggie crumble for the ground turkey and neither of us could taste a difference in flavor or consistency. Overall, it was excellent, and the cheddar cheese at the end adds a really nice flavor to the final product.

This chili was unique, healthy, and delicious. My whole family, including the kids, didn't hesitate in saying it was great. I've passed it on several times in just the few weeks since I first made it.

After reading the other reviews, I added the black beans, corn, and extra spices. I still thought it was "just okay". My family liked it, but didn't rave about it like they do when they REALLY love something. I don't think I will make this again.

This was awesome even though at first it sounds kind of odd. I made it for a work luncheon and it was a hit. My husband doesn't even like chili and wanted it for his dinner. I would add a little chicken broth and some corn and kidney beans just to make it a little more hearty!

This was very good, but may have been a little bland without some extra spices...  I added some extra chile powder for a more spicy flavor and added quite a bit of cumin to the turkey while it was browning.  Loved the texture the pumpking gave this dish!

Very good and nutritious. I added a little chicken stock because some people said that it was too thick (but I like my chili thick). Also added black beans and corn, some more spices as it was a little bland without. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good once I added:
1 can baked beans
1 cup cooking red wine
1 TBSP worchesteshire sauce
3 TBSP  chili powder
1 tsp orgegano
1 chili
lots of pepper to taste and salt
After all these additions it was a big hit at my office potluck.

This is really good.  The pumpkin adds a nice thickness.  I always seem to up the cumin and chili powder a bit to fit our preferences. Totally enjoy this unique and healthy dish.

Very Good! I followed the recipe closely, though I used a red bell pepper instead of the others, and used diced tomatoes flavored with chili's. I also Added cumin and red pepper to the spices, with a tiny dash of cinnamon. Mmm! Husband loved it!

Yum! Fantastic recipe. Per previous posters' recommendations, I added black beans and added more spices (I put in an envelope of taco seasoning and some thyme and cumin, in addition to the chili powder), then served it over rice. Delicious! I can't stop eating it!!

My husband and change don't go well together - but he LOVED this recipe - we ALL did, even my kids.  I did take the other reviews' advice and added spices, beans, chicken stock, and I doubled the tomatoes, but will probably triple them next time because I really like those chunks in there.  But this recipe was an instant hit and will be made over and over in our home!

I followed other reviewers' advice and made the following changes: added black beans, corn, and cumin.  Because many other reviews said this recipe was too bland I used diced tomatoes chili style instead of regular diced tomatoes. I thought this helped.  I liked this chili but I don't know that it is for everyone.

I thought this was a little bland, but I made it without the turkey, so the meat may have added that extra bit of flavor. I made it with fresh pumpkin, which I roasted and pureed with a touch of almond milk, and I added pumpkin chunks and simmered the chili in a slow cooker. Plus, I added a can of kidney beans during the last hour of cooking. The only change in spices I made was to add a cinnamon stick, but after tasting the chili once it was finished, I added cumin, which dramatically improved the flavor. Also, I topped it with an avocado, which gave it a little more dimension. I can see where this chili would be really good with cheese.

This was a big hit on a cool football Sunday.  Like others, I added corn and red kidney beans, I also just used green peppers.  I also added just a splash of low sodium chicken broth, some cumin, and pumkin pie spices and just a touch more chili powder.  I didn't want it too spicey as I was feeding it to my young boys (but I added tobasco to mine)It was so good, such a great mix of sweet and spicy.  I also made it in my crock pot, which helped w/ making it not so thick (but still very hearty).  The smell alone was to die for!

I will definatly make this again!  I think I may want to try using a turkey breast and chopping it up next time instead of ground turkey.

I made this today and it was *delicious*. I altered a recipe a bit though... I don't like using canned pumpkin, and I think fresh pumpkin season is over, so I used all of a medium butternut squash. I also added a can of organic mixed chili beans, and coarsely chopped carrots. Then a bit of cumin and allspice.
The squash is subtle, but you can def tell it's there. I will make again.

This recipe was great, everyone I made it for LOVED it! I did add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to taste, and it really made a world of a difference! I highly suggest adding it especially if its made around the holidays! ENJOY!

Good, but I added some more seasonings.  I added cocoa, cinnamon, beans (red kidney,black,greatnorthern), and cilantro at the end.  I have not made it the same way twice, so I am sure I forgot some spices!

This is a good, hearty chili! I was a little nervous about the pumpkin but it gets all mixed in and adds really nice texture and nutrients without changing the taste. I did add more tomatoes and some beans, but didn't need to add any chicken broth, like some reviewers. I augmented the seasonings a little bit, adding more chili powder, cumin, garlic, and some hot sauce. I will make it again, because my husband likes his chili thick and not watery.

I needed a recipe for pumpkin & found this. Chili must have beans in it. So, I modified it. Four out of 5 people in my house loved it. The fifth person is on the autistic spectrum & didn't like the texture. I added pinto beans w/bacon, a small can of bean w/bacon soup, a can of water, a can of pork&beans, a tbsp. of chili powder, red pepper flakes to taste, a can of tomatoes. Instead of sauteing the onion & garlic, I simmered it in 1 cup of water w/a chicken bouillon cube. I let it simmer for 10 minutes to blend the spices & called it Autumn Chili, to try & disguise the pumpkin.

I never would have made this recipe had it not been for the favorable reviews.
I also used the full can of pumpkin, only 2T sugar and a large can of diced tomatoes. I browned and drained ground meet (instead of turkey) and added about a Tablespoon of LA Gold (hot sauce).  Instead of adding water, I added tomato juice (about 10 oz.) which worked out well since it added flavor as well as thinning the chili.  I followed the remainder of the base recipe.   We added no sour cream or cheese.  Neither was necessary.  This recipe was a pleasant surprise. We'll make this one again.

This was a great base, I did follow other suggestions though and did the following:  I halved the recipe, used a full can of tomatoes, 4 cups of water with 3 chix boullion cubes, dash of pumpkin pie spice, one can of pumpkin puree, added corn, black beans, cumin, cayanne - in the end forgot the sour cream and cheese but didn't need it.  Thanks!  You can't even tell it's pumpkin but gives it a great texture.  Made it with "absolute mexican cornbread" on the site.  Perfect dinner.

I made this recipe for my co-workers. At first they turned there noses up.  Pumpkin in Chili! After they tasted it they loved it as I did.  I did add an extra can of tomatoes as well as black beans and corn. But overall it was great!

I only tried this recipe so I could use up some pureed pumpkin I had in the freezer but I don't think I'll be making it again - it was very bland, which I should have realised beforehand.  Turkey is bland to start with (as is pumpkin).  It would need spicing up and seasoning a lot to make it tasty.

Yummy recipe! I added some cumin, and people didn't even know it was turkey rather than beef. Not overly pumpkin-y. This is my new go-to chili recipe!

When I read the recipe I thought it would make for some great chili but then I saw reviews I realized it needed some tweaking. I made my chili with fresh butternut squash that I diced and roasted in a 400 degree oven with olive oil salt and pepper for 30 mins until tender. I think its important to season that meat while its searing, I used about a teaspoon and a half of taco seasoning and salt to taste and didnt drain the turkey. I added a can of pink kidney beans although next I'll add just half a can because the butternut squash really covered the creaminess. I semi-smashed the squash when it came out the oven making sure to leave it chunky then I added a bay leaf and homemade chicken broth (less salt) until the consistency looked right to me. Everyone loved it.

I had the same problems that most had.  I added a 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes and chiles, 8 oz. chicken broth, 1 can of black beans and a variety of seasonings.  As the recipe stands, the taste was a bit bland and it was too thick for my liking.  The basis of the recipe is a very good beginning and a wonderful opportunity add some individual creativity.  We thoroughly enjoyed with the modifications and will make again.  Next time, I want to try 50/50 ground turkey/ground beef.  My husband added worsetshire sauce to his bowl to "boost the beefiness".

I made two batches of this for some friends; one vegetarian by adding a can of kidney beans and a can of garbanzo beans, and the other one with the ground turkey.  I added some spices to the veggie one: sage, thyme, and some rosemary, which I think helped the flavor.  It was pretty good, but could have used more flavor- the lime juice and cilantro might make it taste better, and something else for heat if you like it spicy.

This is a great dish with a few additions.  Made per the receipe but found it way too thick.  Added about one cup of seasoned chicken broth, some crushed red pepper, and a few dashes of hot sauce.  Was much better the second day.  My daughter loves it.  I added some seasoned white and red beans just to mine, old farm girls can't believe people eat chili without beans.

This was surpisingly very good.  I did add a can of black beans and also added a package of McCormick Chili seasoning for extra flavor. The pumpkin added something "a little extra"; no one could figure out what it was, but they definately liked the flavor.  Will be making this on a regular basis.

This was very good and my family gave it a thumbs up, even my picky son. Easy to make, I simmered it for an hour and served it warmed up the next day. I plan to take it to a Halloween potluck using TVP instead of turkey for all the vegetarians.

GREAT recipe!  Things to note:  As with many of the other reviewers, I agree adding extra chili pepper powder is good for a bit more of a bite, as well as some corn and perhaps a can of black beans or other.  Chicken broth is also good; initial consistancy is almost that of something servable on a plate - outstanding recipe; don't let the pumpkin fool you, really good!

Certainly an interesting recipe.  My husband and I both thought the pumpkin was an excellent addition to chili.  It added a depth to the flavor without overpowering.  However, we didn't love the rest of the chili recipe.  But I think next time we make our own chili recipe, we'll add some pumpkin.  Thanks for the interesting recipe!
