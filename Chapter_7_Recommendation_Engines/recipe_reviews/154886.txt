The published recipe doesn't state it ( when I submitted it I had in the directions a 1 inch baking sheet ) and I STRONGLY recommend a shallow baking dish such as a cookie sheet ( 1" deep )
instead of a casserole dish. I think the finished dish has a better texture and appearance being just a little bit thinner. It will still rise up to about an inch and a half.. Today I doubled the sausage as considered by bookwormans below. Definitely not to much. Thanks for the advice.
10,26,19.
Today I was goofing off and tried a muffin tin.
 NICE. 
Every one had a nice crusty edge. Easy to handle. Dips in syrup or whatever great. 40 yr old tin so brushed with oil. Be sure to preheat pan just a bit.

I needed to use up some pancake mix so I used 2 & 1/4 cups of pancake mix, 2 tsp baking powder, 2 eggs, 1 & 1/2 cups milk, 2 tsp vanilla & 1 pound of maple sausage and baked for 20 minutes in a 375 degree oven in a cookie sheet that had been sprayed & preheated.

Very good and easy to make. I did use a cookie sheet and think that was perfect. If I had used a deeper dish, it would have been too thick. I doubled the amount of sausage (Jimmy Dean maple) and tripled the vanilla. I also spread butter on top while it was still warm. Served with maple syrup.

This recipe was a keeper. Only reason I rated it a 3 out of 5 stars is because it is very thick. I did take the advice of others after my first attempt and baked the recipe in a cookie sheet. This recipe makes a lot and we had almost too much leftover. It would be a great dish for if you're having company over in the morning. Otherwise, everything was delicious and it's very easy to make.

took the advice of others and used cookie sheet.  Also as a shortcut used 3.5 cups bisquick in place of flour, baking powder and salt.

This is a delicious recipe.  The only change that I will make next time is to double the sausage.  It is great for either supper or breakfast.  Served with syrup it is reminiscent of a sausage McGriddle.  My family really enjoyed it.  Thanks!

AMAZING!! I loved this recipe. I read the reviews before I made it and decided to double the sausage and I also added 1/2 cup of blueberries to the batter. Next time I make this I will cut the recipe in half because it is just my husband and I. Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum!  We used 1 package of Jimmy Dean's Sage Sausage and it was enough for us.  Definitely need to use a jelly roll pan and spread the batter to the edges for uniform thickness.  I didn't do that and the middle was bordering on too thick while the edges were a nice thickness.  Will freeze the remaining squares for a quick breakfast option during the week.

Loved this recipe.  But definitely bake it in a jelly roll pan/cookie sheet.  Kids loved it too.

I was looking for a recipe (for dinner) that I could use some venison sausage I received as a gift and you wouldn't necessarily know it was venison. Found this and it sounded perfect. I read the previous reviews and made a few adjustments: doubled the sausage, cook the casserole in a shallow (1' deep) cookie sheet for 25 minutes. It came out perfect. However this recipe makes a ton and the 5 of us ate maybe 1/3 of it. Leftovers are good, though. When I make this again I'll halve the recipe and use a smaller cookie sheet. Served with Suppertime Egg Burritos {from this site} & lots of syrup. It tastes a lot like a McGriddle without the eggs. Thanks for this fabulous and easy recipe.

I used this as base for Maple Bacon Pancake - far better than baking mix suggested. Will probably work to amalgamate the two recipes even more!

This was a hit with my kids.  They love pancakes and it was so much easier than standing over a pan.  It makes a lot and we had a lot of leftovers, so next time I will half the recipe.

Very Heavy.  It's more like sausage and biscuit.  Definitely use a larger, thinner pan and add more sausage.

This is a nice sub for pancakes....just cooked this and went by original recipe. and as many of you have stated in your reviews....if you are a meat lover you need to up the sausage to 2 or even 2.5 pounds...and really need to NOT use a 13 x 9 baking dish...the batter maxed out at 3.5" in the center...(sides of pan was to hot after pre-warm so edges cooked faster ---and made batter push up in the center) but it is a good dish!!!

Yes, and then I adjusted it to make it easier. Two cups of Krustez Pancake Mix prepare as directed, then add 1/4 cup Brown Sugar, 1/4 tsp. Cinnamon. Cook the Bacon,and sausge as directed and crumble into Pancake mix. Pour into Pam sprayed pan and bake for 25 minutes @ 375° Awesome, when done just add whatever butter you chose. Sweet and moist enough to not need any syrup.

Made this in a jelly roll pan as others suggested. I also didn't add sausage because we had that separately. It is ideal with two toddlers because we didn't have to take the time to make individual pancakes, keep them warm, etc. It took 14 minutes to bake and was a big hit with my family.

I am gluten intolerant so I made a modification to this recipe based on what I had on hand: instead of using four cups of flour, I used two of gluten free pancake mix, half a cup of almond flour and one and a half cups of gluten free all purpose flour. It was a little bit dry, but otherwise quite good and well received at our church potluck.

Instead of using ground sausage, I used breakfast sausage patties. Poured a bit of batter into a large cupcake tin, and topped with a bit more batter. It makes a yummy and quick breakfast "sandwich". Am going to figure out how to include egg and cheese next.

This was so good! I used a blueberry maple pork sausage and a whole wheat mix I had gotten. It has some cornmeal in it, so it tasted like the pancake on a stick type thing from the fair!!!! Will definitely make this again for the fam over the holidays too!

My family enjoyed this.  I liked that it was much less time consuming for me than making pancakes for 9 people.  I could throw it in the oven and do other things.  I am going to try making one up ahead and putting it in the fridge so they can try cutting slices and heating it up as wanted during the week.

Very easy to make. I cut the recipe in half, except the sausage I used a full pound. I baked it in a half sheet pan, I thought it was a little thin; but my husband and son disagreed. They loved it. Next time I make this I will add more oil or butter so it wont be as dry and i will drizzle maple syrup on top of the battet before I put in oven. So the maple flavor will soak threw.

I make this every time I have to make church breakfast and it's always a hit.  Half of a recipe bakes up perfectly in a 13x9 pan....the only thing I don't halve is the sausage and I add blueberries on top just before baking.

We liked this. It was a little plain though. I might make it again.

Very good, but needed extra meat. Sausage could be doubled, or you could add bacon. I'll do both next time

This dish was great and very easy to make.  My husband loved it.  It was also great as a leftover.  My husband took the leftovers to work for breakfast.  I will definately make this dish again and again.  I added a little extra sausage and served it warm with maple syrup.

I'm sorry, we just didn't care for this.  Seemed a bit bland and too tough.

It is pretty good. Its easy and the kids liked it, I would just double the amount of sausage next time.  It was really good served with eggs.  I think the biggest perk to this recipe is that it is simple and can be served for any meal.  Also, it is good topped with maple syrup.

This recipe is quite heavy and dense...I was hoping for something more like a McGriddle and this wasn't it.  Maybe that other reviewer had an idea of using a more shallow pan.  For me, this recipe is really missing the egg taste.  It contains egg in the batter but I think it needs actual eggs.  I don't think I would make it again.
