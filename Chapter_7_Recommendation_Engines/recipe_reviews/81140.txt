My husband needed a Mahi Mahi recipe fast, so we looked online and found this one. We both were so amazed at how wonderful the flavor is! He only had two fillets, and he kept the fillets whole and did not cube them. He used about three cloves of fresh garlic instead of the stuff in a jar. He also used red wine since we didn’t have any white on hand. We also didn’t have any diced tomatoes with the peppers; but we did have a can of diced tomatoes with basil, so he used that and added a bit of his dried red peppers. It was raining, so he put it into the oven and baked it at 450. We had no idea if we’d like this dish; so as soon as it came out of the oven, we both sampled it. It was so delicious that we ate it immediately. (We forgot the cheese.)  The fish was very moist. This is a very easy recipe and the flavor was awesome! We both said we would definitely make this again.

Excellent, and very different fish recipe.  I made a few changes:
1) Used olive oil instead of butter--was good, but next time I will try the butter (or do half and half oil and butter).
2) Did not have jarred garlic, so used garlic powder
3) Used bottled lemon juice, as I did not have fresh lemons
4) Used motzerrela cheese, as did not have pepperjack--next time I will try the pepperjack
5) Baked the fish at 350 for 30 minutes in a covered casserole dish instead of grilling
6) I added green and red bell peppers, yellow squash, mushrooms along with the onion--which really turned out very well

Delicious--Great recipe--thanks!!

I don't want to rate this, because I was the one who submitted it..(smile)..For some reason one ingredient was not added. Onions, and lots of them. I usually use one of those really big ones, diced and spread all over the fish before the tomatoes. 

I am really glad you enjoyed this, because it really is so yummy!!

Well, it was 39 degrees outside and raining so I decided to cook this dish in the oven.  I used a covered casserole and baked for about 30 minutes at 425.  I cut the recipe down for 4 people but used one whole 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes-- didn't have the kind with green chilis, so chopped up a jalapeno and sprinkled on top instead.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was FABULOUS.  An easy way to make great tasting fish.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I used Mahi Mahi filets instead of cutting the fish into chunks, and the fish was frozen when I put it into the foil. I did not put on the pepper jack cheese at the end.  Instead, I served the fish over rice and grated fresh Parmesan cheese over the top. I also sliced the onion rather than dicing it. It was really yummy, and I will do it again.  I might add 1/2 tsp. of dried basil next time for an extra burst of flavor.

I used tequilla instead of wine and it was FANTASTIC!!  I didn't feel like opening a full bottle of wine for the small amount needed in the recipe.

This was fantastic but I do have some tips:  drain almost all the juice before adding the wine and lemon, cook for 30 minutes instead of 35 - it was a bit overdone, you can just use aluminum foil instead of an aluminum pan, and be cautious if you are a wuss like me. . .this was spicy.  For wusses, I would just use regular dices tomatoes without the peppers.

I scaled this down for 2 people, since I only had a half pound of fish.  I basically just dumped the ingredients on top of the fish, sealed it over with foil and stuck it under the broiler.  It was really good!  My husband loved it!

I really liked this mahi recipe, I didn't have any wine so I used tequila and made my own tomato sauce with garlic and onions. I also used oj (had no more lemons).  It turned out very good! The fish had plenty of flavor.

Delicious! My husband is a big fish person, I'm not so much, but this was very good! I only made for two, it was about a pound worth for two fillets. It took 35 minutes at 425 in the oven and was perfect. I did choose to use fresh garlic and I added red bell pepper (surprisingly my favorite with it bite for bite), 1 diced seeded jalapeno, 1 tsp fresh cilantro, and 1 green onion. The only reason I added it was because I was originally going to make another recipe with the Mahi but decided to use this one at the last minute and I'm glad I did!

This was delicious.  I added some chopped jalapeno (if you like it hot!).  Even my husband liked it and he doesn't like tomatoes.  I served with white rice to soak up the juice.

I used mahi mahi filets and my oven's broiler. Perhaps I screwed up, but other than those modifications, I followed the recipe exactly. Sorry. :(

Tonight I gave this recipe a whirl, since I wanted to do something different with mahi mahi. I had to work with what I had on hand, i.e. lime juice instead of lemon, dry Cajun seasoning instead of chiles and fresh tomatoes instead of the canned. Also, I used a cast iron pan, which was easy to transfer to the oven, because I took the advice of others and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes instead of grilling it. This not only tasted delicious, but my husband noted that it is restaurant-gorgeous once it's on the plate! Definitely a keeper.

Very tasty!  I used fresh garlic and mozzarella cheese instead of pepperjack as those were what I had on hand.  I baked mine for 20 minutest at 400 degrees and it turned out wonderful!

Awesome.  Scaled it down to accomodate 1.5 lbs of mahi mahi.  I also went with the oven method... cooked it covered at 425 for 20 minutes and then mixed it up and put it under the broiler for about 4 minutes.  I also sprinkled it with a little basil and didn't add the cheese.  For me, fish and cheese just don't go.  Quick, easy, and really great flavor.  Thanks, Helene!

This was really good!   We followed the recommendation of previous posters, and left them as fillets--we used three of the Costco frozen fillets.  Instead of using an aluminum pan, we sprayed some aluminum foil with cooking spray, placed the fillets on the foil, covered them with the onion slices, dotted them with 3 tbsp of butter, and then spooned the "sauce" over them.   To make the sauce, we used a 14 1/2 oz can of regular diced tomatoes, granulated garlic (we were out of garlic cloves), a small can of diced green chilis, the wine & the salt & pepper, put it all in a small bowl, and stirred until it was well mixed.   Finally we took one large lemon, cut it in half, and then in quarters, squeezed the juice over the fish, and then included the lemon pieces with the fish.   After adding a second layer of foil underneath the first, we left the top open, put the whole thing in our grill basket, and threw it on the grill for about 30 minutes.   Even the 4 yr old devoured it, although she scraped off the "peppers".   Pair this with some rice & some green beans, and you have a yummy meal, that's actually good for you!  P.S.  We forgot the cheese, but I'm sure that would have been amazing too!

This is just okay.  I wouldn't make again.  I followed the recipe, except that I used fresh garlic and only had to cook it 20 min.  I should've know that dumping a can of tomatoes on it would not be good.  I bought my Mahi Mahi fresh and what a waste of good money and seafood.

This was so yummy. I baked mine covered at 450 deg. for 20 minutes. I scaled back and only did 2 fillets, whole, and just used a whole tomato diced instead of canned. Also topped with parmesan.

I read the variations on the reviews and decided to make it according to the recipe the first time. I was a winner!  Next time I'll use whole filets and cook it a little longer as I like the onion cooked more, and it really doesn't need cheese, so I might try it without(although I love cheese!) great recipe, thanks!

This was good and really simple to make.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have the pepperjack cheese and used Meunster instead.  I'm glad I did as the dish was very spicy already.

This was excellent even though I changed it completely.  I cooked it in my glass pyrex and covered it with foil.  I took 5 Mahi filets in the dish, covered it with minced onions and garlic. Poured stewed tomatoes (all I had in the house). 1/2 c white wine. chili powder. Pour some lemon juice (I didnt measure). Covered with foil and baked at 450 for 30 mins. Turned out perfect. Served with rice and green beans.  It could have used more pepper and garlic, but I was cautious due to a sick kid.  Hubby topped with hot sauce and Tabasco.

I really liked this recipe!!!  I omitted the pepper jack cheese to reduce the fat, and I had no tomatos, and it was still good~

I used shallots as I didn't have onions.  I also used stewed tomatoes & pureed them in the blender.  It tasted similar to my father's guiginade (fish stew) that he makes for Christmas.  I used 1.5 lbs mahi mahi and didn't need the full can of stewed tomatoes.

I started with the original recipe but just for 2 in pyrex baking dish in oven. Fantastic ! Now I use a larger baking dish and add fresh Asparagus next to the fillets from the start .... perrrrrfect side . even works on the grill

Great Recipe Idea. I had to make it different since I did not have all the ingredients. Coated the Mahi-Mahi (4-6 0z ea.) on both sides with EVOO (extra virgin oilive oil), also Seasoned (rubbed) with Adobo, Garlic & Onion Powder. Greased pan with EVOO (Instead of butter) added Lemon Juice, wine and Rotella Hot Diced Tomato and Habanero. Cooked on Pre-heated Griill per Instructions for 15 to 20 minutes (keeping an eye on it to prevent over cooking it since my Webber Grill is New). Added Sharp Cheddar cheese and Gouda Smoked Cheese cause thats what I had. It came out very moist and delicious. Thank You Helene you deserve 5 stars

Made this for my husband exactly as stated (but adjusted amounts because we had less Mahi Mahi). He really liked it, the cheese was an interesting addition.

It was spicy but very good.  It took about 5 minutes for me to prep.  I used a filet, garlic power, fresh lemon juice, white cooking wine, canned tomatoes with green chile peppers and sliced onions, salt and pepper.   I wrapped it all in foil and baked it 35 minutes on 350.   White rice was the side dish.  It was easy for one person.  Would recommend and cook again!

used a mix of other suggestions, baked it in at 425 for 40-45 min, 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes, 1 can green chilis, 1 lemon and 1/4 cup wine, cut butter to a few pats on the bottom of the metal pan, covered with foil until the end, plenty of liquid remains, we took the fish and salsa type trimmings and make fish tacos!

This was fantastic!  I made this for 2 servings instead of 12 and I added garlic salt and used mozzarella cheese since I had it on hand.  I baked it in a covered glass dish.  Will definitely be making this again!

This was a really good recipe.  I cut it down considerably (for one person).....threw it into the oven in a little foil tent and it came out great.  Very flavorful with lots of zip.  I didn't, however, add on the cheese.  Watching my cholesterol, so I didn't need it, although I'm sure it would taste great.

We were in Mexico and had just picked up 5 pounds of fresh dorado (mahi-mahi).  I didn't have all the ingredients from this recipe but I followed it the best I could and it's definitely a superior way to cook the fish.
Instead of the butter I poured some Olive Oil on it and squeezed a few limes in.  I didn't have tomatoes but I gave it a kick by chopping up 2 fresh jalapeno in.  Very good choice!  Instead of the jarred garlic I chopped up almost an entire head of garlic.  Also a very good choice.
I sliced the onion into thin rings and mixed them in.  This both tasted great and gave it visual appeal.
I lined the pan with foil and more olive oil and covered the top tightly with more foil.  I don't know what the temp was but we cooked it in the oven on med-hi for about 30 minutes.  I will definitely do this again.

I made this for dinner tonight but with some changes. It just seemed silly to use canned tomatoes when Jersey tomatoes are so good in the summer, so I made a fresh pico de gallo and used that instead with about 3 tbs. melted butter and 1/2 cup of white wine. I didn't cover it as it cooked, and it didn't take anywhere near 35 minutes. I also omitted the cheese.

I'm going against the majority on this one - this wasn't one of my favorites.  The word that came to my mind was "interesting."  I didn't cook it on the grill - but in the oven at 375 for about 30 minutes.  The fish was done perfectly, but the toppings didn't go all that well to me.  I did forget to put the cheese on top, but then again, I don't think I have ever put cheese on my fish!  I probably won't try this again.

I have made a variation of this for a while, adding fresh sqaush and zuchini into the mix, and some good cajun spice. Always a hit.

This recipe was really great!  I cooked it for my family and they were really impressed.  It was a bit on the spicy side but not overwhelming.  I added a bit of parsley to the sauce which gave it a bit more color and flavor and I baked it at about 350 for about 40 minutes or so.  It was excellent!

This was amazing! I followed other reviewers suggestions.  I used 3 frozen fillets from BJs (defrosted) so I had to tweak the recipe. I sprayed some foil with Pam and put it on top of a grill pan.  I put slices of onion and bits of butter over the fish (about 2 tbs). I used a full can of Rotel, added about 1 tbs of minced garlic, 3 tbs of white wine and salt and pepper.   I poured all over the fish and then squeezed a half of a lemon all over it.  I grilled it on high heat for about 25 mins.  Perfection! I can't wait to make it again!

Used catfish, because sustainable (US) Mahi Mahi was not available and left the fillets whole (skinned and deboned).  Also, I changed the recipe to 5 servings, which used 2 pounds of fish.  Baked in the oven at 425 degrees for 25 minutes and came out perfectly, thanks to all of those who put temp and bake times.  Served roasted asparagus on the side.  You can put the asparagus on a roasting pan, drizzle with olive oil and spices to your liking, roast in oven on rack below or next to the fish for 10 minutes, flip, 5 more minutes for 2 pounds of asparagus.

My family loved it!  I'm not a fan of fish so I used Mahi Mahi for the family and one piece of Tilapia(tastes like chicken, lol) for myself and it was wonderful.  I even tried a bite of the Mahi Mahi and it wasn't too fishy for me. I will definately make this again.  Thanks!

We have made this dish repeatedly since first trying it.  Because we have fresh fish so often, I am always looking for ways to make it taste different -- this is dramatically so.   The tomato w/chilies and the pepperjack cheese are an awseome combination, lots of flavor, just enough kick to make "boring" fish come alive!  Hints: Cook this on relatively high heat or the liquid does not cook off, making it "soupy".  Otherwise, no changes needed!

My husband hates fish, and my 3 year old hates veggies, and they both ate this up.  I scalled this recipe down for 4 and it was the perfect amount.  I served this with grilled potato fans stuffed with cajun and pepperjack cheese, and it was the perfectside dish.  We'll definately make this again.

I thought this was great! I love spicy stuff so I even added some red pepper flake but don't be fooled, for those of you that "like" spicy food but don't eat it all the time, the tomatoes with peppers can be just enough.  I baked the fish and served it on rice and made sure there was lots of juice, the only problem was the fish got over cooked so check it often. Thanks for the great recipe!

My dad just came back from a fishing trip and brought home a bunch of fish.  I wanted to try some new recipes so I came on here and found this one.  My whole family loved it!!  I didn't use all of the marinated and simmered the rest one the stove on low heat.  I put it over the top of the fish after it was done.  I had even non fish eaters/lovers eat and love this recipe!!

Yum!  I scaled this down for 2 lbs. of mahi mahi (5 servings).  Very easy, very tasty.  Definitely a keeper!

I changed a few things. Like another viewer the only can of tomatoes I had in the house was Petit Diced tomatoes in Garlic and Olive Oil. I poured it on the fish and topped with sliced lemons and it was awesome. I didn't have pepperjack cheese, but it was still great. My husband loved it too, he said it almost tasted like a chicken recipe; which being on a diet is great to add flavor. I found that using that particular type of diced tomatoes you use less ingredients and still get all the flavor!

this was absolutely great.  I did my own version off of the recipe because I didn't have any peppers, and I was only fixing this for myself (hubby doesn't like seafood).  I used the onions, butter, wine, garlic and also threw in a little dried dill.  Cooked as suggested but in the oven rather than grill and it came out soooo scrumptious!

Great recipe!  I didn't have some of the ingredients so I used V-8 juice, canned, diced green chiles, tequila, and muenster cheese and baked it in aluminum foil pockets.  It was delicious!

Loved this recipe. Easy to prepare and quick. Grilled instead of baked and it was delicious. My husband, who doesn't care for fish, said he wouldn't mind if I made this once a week.

We made this for our residents at our assisted living facility and those that had it said it was "a keeper"! We made a few changes since we were making it for an older group of people; we used apple juice instead of wine, regular diced tomatoes without the green chilies and Monterey Jack/Colby cheese instead of the Pepper jack. It's a recipe we will definitely use again.

I just made this tonight, DELISH!!!  I loved it!  It was so quick and easy.  I used the foil packs that others suggested and baked for 30 min. then added the cheese when it was done.  I didn't have any lemon, but beside that, I followed the ingredients as listed.  I will be making this again!  It was a little "soupy" but next time I will get crusty bread to dip in it!!

We thought this recipe was okay, but maybe a bit too spicy. My husband even likes spicy foods a lot, but thought it threw off the fish. I served it over rice, which we liked.

I was very skeptical at first for some reason, but the recipe definately made me a believer!!!  Out of all of the recipes I have made from allrecipes this was by far my families favorite.  We wrapped the fish filets individually with a little bit of each ingredient to make individual packets. I also took some advice from other reviews and only cooked them on the barbeque for 30 minutes.  Since they were individually wrapped in foil they stayed warm throughout a lovely Sunday dinner on the patio.  There was plenty of seconds and nothing left over.  They want to make sure I make it again...soon! Thanks for this quick and easy recipe.

Scaled this recipe down for a dinner for two and it came out great.  I had fresh tomatoes and jalapenos on hand - so I used those instead of canned - and it was great.  I added some basil to the mix - and I would probably add a bit of a spice again.  Also - forgot to add the cheese - and didn't miss it at all - but would like to try next time!

I would recommend adding some rice or something to this dish before cooking, as it is very watery.  I probably will not make again.

I used fresh tomatoes and fresh jalepeno instead of the canned.  My husband loved this recipe!  My only problem was that when I took the pan of the grill, the outside rim of the fish had charred and some of the fish seemed a little dry.  I might decrease the time to cook next time.

Good flavor.  I don't think I'm a fan of the texture of this fish but that has nothing to do with the recipe.  It was good. Spicy and flavorful.

I am Raidermoms husband and I have just made this recipe. Let me say I "HATE" any fish that is not fried. But, this recipe has completely taken me by surprize. It was wonderful and very easy to make. I was going to have the left overs for lunch tomorrow, but there aren't any. Thank you

When it comes to cooking fish, I'm at a loss. So, I came here to look for help. I found this fabulous recipe, gave it a whirl, and it was a hit with my family. I was worried that my 12-year-old daughter wouldn't like it (fish and chile peppers - not her faves!)and had a can of soup ready to heat for her. To my surprise, she loved the dish and wanted to take leftovers to school for lunch the next day! The dish is very tasty and was a great alternative to the usual slab o' fish on the grill. Thanks for the creative boost.  We're adding this recipe to our collection!

I'll give it 3 stars on taste only.  First, instructions indicate grilling on "high".  That isn't too specific.  My grill can ramp up to over 500f.  I did grill at 400f.  Second, putting all of those ingredients in an aluminum pan, there is a lot of liquid.  So, basically at that temperature with that amount of liquid, the fish simply poached and was over cooked at the 30 minute mark.  Fortunately, the meat tasted good and was salvageable.  I re-purposed the fish into fish tacos today.  Since the taste was really good, mixing in some sour cream and picante sauce saved the dry over cooked fish.  Thanks for your effort, but I'll keep looking for another mahi mahi recipe.

I wanted to love it, after I added a lot of salt and cayenne it was pretty good.  Not sure what I did wrong.  The only change I made was using fresh garlic.

Great recipe, this is a keeper. I cut it down for two with out any leftovers using just two fillets and I baked it in the oven at 450 degrees for 35 minutes covered with foil. Nice bite to it. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was fast and easy with very little clean-up.  I used fresh tomatoes and added crushed red pepper for the heat.  I was serving with zucchini, so I just sliced the zucchini thin and placed on top of the other vegetables.  Since it was raining I just cooked in the oven.  The fish was moist and the veggies gave lots of flavor. The meal got rave reviews from my husband and brother.  The garlic and onion are a must!  I don't know why only one of the pictures actually looks like the recipe with the tomatoes.  PS - I forgot the cheese too but I don't think it's needed.

i was so hesitant  at first. i kept the fish in fillets and only did 3 so i modified the ingredients to the smaller serving.  this was absolutely delish. the people who dislike onions or tomoatoes ate it all. will definitely keep in  my regular recipe rotation.

Delicious! I used shallots instead of onions and didn't use tomatoes or cheese at all (I didn't have either) and it came out wonderful!

My husband and I made this on vacation and we LOVED it! Only change was less garlic. We cubed the fish and cooked it in foil packets on the grill. Even my 9 year old son loved it! Thanks.

This was a very nice recipe for fish. I made it generally as specified, but omitted the wine as I didn't have any. Also added some red pepper and fresh tomatoes around the edges, and omitted the cheese, because,frankly, I forgot! Very good, we are not big fish eaters, but this one I would make again for sure.

I really like the quickness and methods in this recipe and I would like to try this one again, open faced on the grill next time.  However, since it was -25F outside I was forced to use the oven.   Texture-wise, I couldn't have asked for anything better as the fish and veggies were perfectly cooked.  Nonetheless, this recipe gets an unfavorable rating from me, and I am pretty sure that the canned tomatoes are the culprit.  I should have strained them for sure, but I really feel that may not have helped as much as I might have hoped.  They really compromise what could be a great recipe.   Most of what I tasted was the bitterness of canned tomato flavor clashing with both white wine and lemon juice to create an even bigger beast of bitterness.  Make sure you drain and/or press the tomatoes through a strainer to minimize the tomato juice. All that being said, I ate it, Mahi Mahi is just too good, even if its not so good.  Yet, if I was to make this again, I would use freshly chopped roma or vine tomatoes.

It was too cold to grill so I followed other comments and baked it in the oven at 425 for 30 min.  Next time I will reduce the time a little or remove the fish from the dish, it continued to while sitting in the hot juices and got a little overcooked.  Overall great flavor and spice, just need to work on the perfect doneness.  Served over rice.

This recipe was simple and delicious! I served it over herbed quinoa, and used the wine/lemon/tomato sauce to moisten it. My family loved it; it had just enough "bite."

Delicious, just don't over cook it like I did.  35 minutes was much too long on our grill.  The sauce was tasty; a bit spicy b/c of the chile peppers.  A nice addition to the recipe box.  We really enjoyed this main dish.

This was my first major disapointment with Allrecipes' user ratings. The mahi mahi came out dry, like styrofoam with sauce on top.  I made the custom version in the oven.  My husband and I couln't finish it, and I threw it out, much to my regret.

This fish is one of my top favorite recipes and is very easy to make. I wrap the fish in a tin foil wrap and place on the grill for about 15-20 minutes. I also do not use the pepper jack cheese in this recipe.

I really wanted to like this recipe, there were plenty of good ingredients.  The instructions don't really give you a clue as far as what temperature you are supposed to cook the fish whether it be in the oven or on the grill.  When we figured out the fish was done, it just seemed so flavorless, like all the ingredients did were sit on top of the fish without seasoning it.  We even jazzed it up a bit, using red onion and some red chili peppers, but the fish had no flavor!  I was so disappointed!

This is the best tasting mahi I've ever made or eaten at a restaurant!  I needed to use the oven rather than the grill, and followed the 2nd comment down on jun. 17, 2005 by TSR3 which added a few ingredients and gave oven temp/time.   The whole family loved it!

This was wonderful!!  I am notorious for cooking dry overcooked fish but this came out super moist with the foil (forgot to use a pan and it was fine!)!!  I didn't have the cheese and it was still great - thanks!

This recipe was fantastic.  We caught a bunch of Mahi Mahi in the Florida Keys and prepared it this way at a dinner party. We followed the recipe exactly. It tasted like something you would get at a fancy seafood restaurant.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Awesome.

I really liked this dish. I did change a few things because of what I had on hand. Instead of jarred garlic I used fresh and I had plain diced tomatoes so I added chopped green peppers and put some lemon juice instead of dry white wine. I also used a pepper jack/cheddar cheese mix. Next time I will get rid of some of the juice from the diced tomatoes.

I made this in my oven, because it was too cold out to grill.  I cut the recipe in half and baked it for 35 minutes at 425.  It was pretty good- I think it would be better if it was made on the grill instead of the oven.

Great recipe! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly as written. I only made 4 Mahi filets and left them whole. Used white tequila instead of wine as another reviewer had suggested. What a great recipe. We grilled them in a pan as written then mixed them with cooked spaghetti noodles and added Colby/jack on top. We then broiled it until the cheese melted. Very delicious meal! Will definitely be adding to our regular list of meal options. I always keep mahi filets in the freezer, so this is a keeper. Thank you!

I really tried to like this recipe. It had a lot of things I like to cook with and sounded yummy.  I followed it as written with no changes.  I was very disappointed in the flavor. Maybe my expectations were too high. I don't know, but I won't be making this again. Family gave it a thumbs down. Sorry! :-(

Only okay, kind of bland, and I was very dissappointed. My husband ate it after pouring a bottle of sauce all over it. I even added basil, and crushed red pepper(we love spicy). I will not try again.

Pretty bland, the seasonings did not really stick but I did not use the tomatoes use the tomato mix or the cheese.  I personally never heard of cheese on fish except on filet of fish at McDonalds but oh well.  I like Mahi Mahi with fish tacos or some sort of deeper seasoning.

This had some great flavor.  I'm just not a big fish person, and this dish still tasted fishy to me.  I might try it with a different kind of fish though.

Great recipe! My whole family loved it, except for the one picky eater who refused to taste it. Will make again, probably served with corn tortillas for fish tacos.

This recipe was easy to prepare and delicious--even my 12-year-old ate it! I used 3 cloves of fresh garlic, 1/2 cup of chardonnay (white) wine, 4 tablespoons of green chili salsa since my stewed tomatoes were plain and 6 T of lemon juice-20 min at 450 served up with some garlic bread--yum!!

Great dish!  My hubby who rolls his eyes at a meal that doens't include meat really liked this, and my kids asked for seconds!  That's hard to beat.

I used halibut (it's what I had) and cooked this in the oven at 425 for about 30 minutes as I needed propane for my grill. I placed the ingredients in the foil as the directions call for, and placed that pouch in a baking dish.  

This was easy to make and I will certainly make it again!
