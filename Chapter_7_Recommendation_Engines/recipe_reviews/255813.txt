I made this for Thanksgiving 2016 and it was really good. I am trying to find a stuffing/dressing recipe close to my Grandmother's but this one wasn't even close. That's ok though it was still good. I didn't add carrots or parsley but everything else I followed through.  The only thing I would change is adding just a tad more broth to the stuffing because the top of it was really dry after baking. Maybe spritzing it after cooking? We'll see...
