This was so good!  I entered in an ice cream contest we had at our church and won 1st place out of 6 entries!  Since it was a cheesecake ice cream I used Cheesecake Pudding instead of vanilla.  I made it in three batches and layered it as stated in the recipe.

Oh my wonderful! Best ice cream ever! I used raspberries since my husband does not care for blueberries, used cheesecake sugar free pudding and 2 cups half and half and 2 cups heavy whip cream. Delish!

absolutely delicious! add your favorite alcohol to the cream mixture (i added about 2 tbsp butter ripple schnapps) adds a little extra flavor and helps prevent the ice cream from freezing too hard

Every time we host a sleepover, this is the most-requested dessert! Due to DS's allergies, I modified the recipe and removed the graham cracker crumbs, 2 tbsp white sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 c butter. I used fat-free half-and-half instead of whipping cream, and it was still creamy and delicious, and fun to make with kids!

I had seen a similar recipe but this was my first time to try the pudding mix in the ice-cream base-  WOW!  this makes great ice cream.  I've made it twice in a week for family and for work associates - EVERYONE gave it 5 STARS.

Wow!  Absolutely THE Best ice cream I have ever made!  I did use the instant cheesecake pudding mix instead of the vanilla.  Otherwise, I made it as written.  Everyone loved it and wanted more.  Next time I will need to make two freezers!

Delicious-even "lightened".  To make it lower fat, I substituted half-and-half for the heavy cream and used skim milk for the milk. I also reduced the amount of butter (I think I used 1/4 c. instead) and used less sugar.  The ice cream wasn't as thick but it was still rich and tasty!

Recipe as written is great, and adding cinnamon and a tiny but of almond extract I kicks up the flavor a notch- nit necessary though!

This is the best!  It makes a double batch in my machine, so extra to share with grateful neighbors, or a large crowd.  I did add more blueberries each time and will double them next time.  Amazing, not like anything you could buy.

Excellent!  Very tasty -- base ice ream is a delicious vanilla all by itself.  Blueberry and graham crackers add a nice flavor and texture.  No need to change a thing.
