Miso soup tastes waterery without a Japanese soup stock called "dashi". My grand mother used to make it from the scratch with sea weed and a dried tuna. You can buy ready-made "dashi-no-moto" at most of Asian super market. It adds deepness and a great aroma to the miso soup.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I made the soup with slices of white mushrooms and added a few more scallons for taste.  I almost doubled the miso paste as well for more taste.  Just be sure not to add too much barsley paste because it will be too strong.  FYI-I got the miso paste in the refrigerator section at Whole Foods (health food store) next to the tofu.  

This is a good recipe and I feel so relaxed and healthy after sipping on this great soup.

it's not bad... not the traditional Japanese miso soup though, I must say. Normally you don't put spinach in the soup... it's traditionally nori (seaweed). But, like I said, not bad. Sorry, not trying to be too critical... being part Japanese and after working at a Japanese restaurant for 6 years, I'm pretty picky about how Japanese food is put together, haha, sorry.

Very good and very easy.  I use bok choy instead of spinach, but would like it either way.  Also, I added sliced mushrooms.  Thanks!

I generally use a combo of powdered vegi 'chicken' broth and powdered mushroom broth with my water for added flavor. The 'chicken' broth adds a savory element while the earthy mushroom broth rounds the flavor out with the two misos very nicely.

Very simple to make. Mellow, calming flavors. The tofu I used wasn't firm enough so make sure you get extra firm. I sauteed it in peanut oil beforehand. Also added some sliced baby bella mushrooms. A good introduction to miso soup.

Yum. I didn't have both kinds of miso, so I used 3TB of white miso(I wanted it a bit stronger). Added a bit of extra green onion...and it was perfect.

I thought this soup was very good and is one of the few vegetarian versions I've seen. I followed the recipe except I added barley and red miso rather than the white and used a little more than called for. This is a keeper and will be a fun recipe to try variations with like the broths and mushrooms suggested by other reviewers or a bit of powdered soy sauce.

I went to an asian grocery store and yet couldn't find anything other than generic soybean miso paste.  This still turned out very good, though a tad salty.

Pretty good, but I should have added more miso to suit my taste.  When I make it again, I will put dried seaweed in place of the spinach.

A very good and easy to make soup.  I doubled the recipe and used vegetable broth instead of water.  I used 4 tablespoons of "Mellow White" miso, it's a mild miso so I used more than the recipe called for .  I really enjoyed the fresh spinach, it's a good substitute for seaweed.

pretty good, my first attempt at making miso soup (or even using miso).  I used kale instead of spinach, and a lot more than the recipe calls for.  I just know that I like kale in soup and had some so I made the change, next time I'll try bok choy.  It was kind of bland and I doubled the miso paste, that must have something to do with my paste.  I'll definitely make again, seems like there are lots of good variations.

Broth is watery.  It needs the flavor and depth of dashi (Japanese fish stock) as a previous reviewer mentioned.

This wasn't what I thought it'd be. It probably was because I used frozen instead of fresh spinach. My husband didn't like it.

This was a great soup.  The only thing missing are the crunchies that come in my favorite local soup.  Thanks so much, I love being able to make this soup at home.

My mother was Japanese, born and raised in Japan.  Miso soup always starts out with a dashi base.  The easiest to find and use is "Hondashi".  Found in the Asian section of most markets and always in Asian markets.  Add to boiling water - about 1 tsp to 1 cup boiling water, stir to dissolve.  Then adjust to your own taste.  I don't use barley miso, only soybean miso either Shiso Miso or Aka Miso.  You can add whatever you want to your soup.  My mother used whatever we had on hand.  If your greens take a bit longer to cook, I suggest you partially cook them in the boiling water before you add the Hondashi.  Miso is a thick paste consistency so I like to take a ladle of the boiling water and stir in my miso to melt and then add it back into the pot.  Miso soup naturally separates so you might have to give your soup a little stir as you eat.  I say experiment with what you like for add-ins.  If you want, start with the "traditional" recipe but then make the recipe your own.  If it tastes good to you, then it's your "traditional" recipe.

I liked the spinach - it needs to be fresh though, and just wilted into the soup.  I used 1 tbsp Genmai brown rice Miso per cup of water since it was too bland for me.  If you don't have dashi use a good splash of Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce for the umami flavour.  And it was improved with a bit of Bragg liquid aminos.
