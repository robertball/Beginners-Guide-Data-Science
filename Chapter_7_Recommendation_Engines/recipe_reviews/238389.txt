This recipe version is for a working mom, a single parent or a quick alternative  to traditional cooking from scratch. Patricia doesn't understand the name of this website is called "ALLrecipes" so I hope this clarifies her confusion. You can very easy switch to the scratch version in your head (chicken breasts cut into strips and coated in dry bread crumbs vs store prepped, real potatoes peeled, boiled and mashed vs store prepped, etc) but this recipe is good for those who don't have more time. I wouldn't give this 1 Star like Patricia did, that is plain rude. It's tasty, quick and easy. That's what counts.

Pure comfort food.  I made my own creamy mashed potatoes and fried chicken strips.  See 'Heather's Fried Chicken' on this site for the chicken seasoning.   A healthy dose of Country Gravy would put this over the top.

Delcious recipe I boomed it up just a little by making the following changes. First I used 6 chicken drumsticks, dipped them in egg, then flour and then italian seasoning, baked them for about 30 mins per side at 375. I then shredded the chicken up and mixed it into about 8 cups of premade mashed potatoes from the night before, I then made up 2 packs of instant brown gravy dumped that in, cooked about 4 cups of frozen corn mixed that in, and then 2 cups of cheddar and a handfull of bacon bits, stirred it all up on stove until the cheese was all melted and it was warmed up enough to eat. Delicious!

Had this for dinner at a friend's house last night and it was pure comfort food in a bowl. They added turkey gravy, stuffing and even jellied cranberry sauce. It was delicious!

I use frozen chicken nuggets, frozen sweet corn, and instant potatoes.  This is a great, quick meal for one or two that can be thrown together after work  in minutes.  Everyone loves it!

Very easy and delicious dish! Brown gravy on top helps blend all of the ingredients together and give it some extra flavor.  I also rolled a few biscuits together and formed them over a bowl and baked it for about 15 minutes to make a biscuit bowl. Just make sure to grease the bowl before forming the biscuits around it.  Will definitely be making this more often. Thank you jreb66!

I've been making this since before my kids were born (38 & 35 yrs old) I prefer to but have not always made it from scratch. Like another reviewer stated I add home made gravy. We do eat a larger portion then what the recipe here states and I'll tell you that this one great comfort food you can enjoy getting stuffed on and then take that wonderful after dinner siesta.

I was making this recipe long before they were at KFC.   I used leftovers from my homemade chicken dinner for my husband's lunch for work.   I do add homemade gravy too.  Delicious!

I've been making this for years but I always make my own smashed  potatoes, add gravy and bake my chicken with bread crumbs. Without the gravy this recipe is just missing something.

This recipe is pretty good as is, but a bit flat.  I always try to have at least two veggies in every meal.  So when I did this one the second time, I added cooked green beans to the mix.  That worked pretty well, but broccoli, my veg of choice for Try Number Three, that works brilliantly.

I added streamed Broccoli since I literally cannot compose dinner with including a veggie. Mashed potatoes are always homemade. Butter, sour cream, 2% milk, heavy whipping cream, mayo, & 9 relatively small russet potatoes. Used frozen chicken breast & chopped into squared pieces. Bag of corn & Colby shredded cheese. I was simply a hit! Eaten by a family of 6!

I love this itâ€™s great to make few more to have on hand for quick meals the only thing I did differently was I added gravy and I used popcorn chicken instead and my kids gave it rave reviews they ate it up so fast! This is a different keeper for me

It was actually pretty good.  Husband liked it.  Used frozen breaded chicken strips and heated in the oven.  Will probably make again.

The combination of boneless breaded fried chicken, corn and mashed potatoes is wonderful comfort food.  Personally, I wouldn't fry the frozen prepared chicken (strips, nuggets, etc).  Heating the chicken in the oven per package directions works just fine for my family.  Thank you for the easy week-night meal idea.

The only changes I made was to bake the chicken in a 375 degree oven for 25 minutes and I used my own cut up chicken breast dipped in panko bread crumbs.

I gave it four stars only because I added some more fattening goodness to it. For my chicken I just baked a bag of Tyson chicken tenders. Then I layered it in a bowl as follows: mashed potatoes, chicken, corn, gravy, shredded cheese and then a scoop of sour cream.

This is good, but not an original recipe... iff you make all the different components from scratch, it's a lot of work.
