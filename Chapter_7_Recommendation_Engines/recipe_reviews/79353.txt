I put this recipe on here a long time ago just wanted to do update!!  I also use fresh cilantro don't know why it was changed to the dried!!  But just wanted to say this same recipe is good for chicken or tuna!!!  If you really want to make a little change try adding a little horseradish!!! My friend gives me home made fresh and sometimes I throw that in there!!  Thanks for your nice comments I ate tuna fish just yesterday made just like this with the addition of horseradish on crackers!! It was tasty!!

Yes, this is a great recipe, but be forewarned about putting 2 tsps of salt into a recipe that only serves 12! I was even nervous putting in the 1/2 tsp that I used (which I thought was plenty). I also used another reviewer's idea to use half mayo and half plain nonfat yogurt and it still came out tasting yummy.

This is a really good salad that I have used with leftover turkey---in fact, I had to search for the recipe and couldn't find it (I thought it was 'carol's turkey salad' for some reason). I only use 1/2 tsp. of salt at the most in this, but otherwise, I love follow the ingred. list. Yummy! Thanks, Cindy! A true favorite, and I can't wait for the holidays to make this with the leftover turkey!

Loved the jalapeno pepper in this salad! I used a savory relish instead of the sweet and did not add even a grain of the salt. If you're one who can't live without dousing everything with salt, I suggest only using a half tsp. Hubby loved this too and thanks!

Wonderful way to use up leftover turkey. I left out cilantro(can't stand it) and added 1/2 minced red onion. Also did not add salt(never do). It was very tasty. Would be terrific with chicken or tuna.

Made this with leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Was real good. I added half a white onion chopped and served on toasted onion rolls.Also, added about half a cup more mayo. Will be making this for years to come. Next time will add some red bell pepper for color and taste. Served with potato chips and dip.

This was an easy and tasty recipe.  My 11 year old granddaughter made this for our special time together and we both really liked it.  She used fresh cilantro instead of dried, using double the tsp. called for.  We paired it with Rosemary French Bread from this site and apple slices with a sweet dip.  Yummy!

This is a good recipe.  I used 1/2 cup light mayo & 1/2 cup light sour cream to reduce the fat content,and I didn't have a fresh jalepeno so I used Mazetta's from the jar. I will definately make it again!

WOW! We devoured it; couldn't get enough. The jalapeno pepper takes away the gamey taste of the turkey. I only added 1 tsp. of salt and 1 tsp. pepper and used 2 Tbsp. of "fresh" cilantro.  Fantastic!

I just tried this recipe and loved it. I didn't use the jalapeno pepper nor the cilantro but did add 1 T of yellow mustard and only used 1 t of salt and pepper along with 6 boiled eggs. I'll use this every time I have leftover turkey.

This was AMAZING.  I took the advice of another reviewer and omitted the salt.  I didn't have celery or fresh jalapenos, so I threw in diced red onion and diced jarred jalapenos.  I will be making this again and again!

This was great. It was a great way to use up leftover holiday bird. I used half mayo and half lowfat sour cream. This gave it a deli flavor. Next time, I will double the amount of jalepeno, too.

This recipe is really good EXCEPT for the amount of salt it calls for.  I wish I had read some of the other reviews or thought about the fact that 2 teaspoons of salt is way too much.  I added and added until the recipe was more than doubled and it was still too salty.  Other than the salt, it was very good.

Having thawed my leftover Christmas turkey, I was in search of recipes in which to use it. I chose this one, as it seemed to be more flavorful than some turkey salad recipes I looked at. I made some changes, in accordance with some reviews, namely in using half low-fat yogurt/half mayonnaise and reducing the salt & pepper. Because I live in Greece, some ingredients are not available, so I used chopped pickles instead of pickle relish, and a canned jalapeno instead of the fresh one (how I wish I could get fresh jalapenos!) Because part of my turkey was taken from the boiled carcass and I feared that it would be tasteless, I added a bit of horseradish sauce. The result was wonderful.

My husband says he gives this recipe a 4 1/2 since he is the one who mostly ate it. I had to us the left over turkey for lunches. I did not add any peppers since that would have been too spicy. Other than that I did not change anything.

This was okay, just a little spicy for our taste.  I will make again, but leave out the jalapeno, maybe a dash of red pepper instead for a hint of spicey.

The jalapeno works well with this recipe. The mayo taste was a little overpowering. Just to kick it up another notch I added two teaspoons of Spicy Brown Mustard. It really balanced out the mayo.

Just made this and followed the recipe exactly, but I did use fresh cilantro, which I love. My only complaint is it turned out way too salty. I was hesitant when I added the two teaspoons called for but did it anyway. I did brine my turkey before roasting, so  the salt amount probably should have been reduced. Be cautious of the salt if using leftover brined turkey.

I omitted the jalapeno and decreased the salt and pepper to 1 tsp each.  This was so delicious and will now be my go-to recipe for leftover turkey!  This was especially delicious since my hubby had smoked the turkey.

I thought this tasted good, but becareful with the salt as it is really salty! I would even start with as little as half. I did like the crunchiness from the celery and jalepeno. I did chop them both very finely though. The only changes I made were making 1/2 recipe, cutting back the pepper by half, using lite mayo, and fresh cilantro for the dried. I found that it got a little watery the next day. I am not sure if it was from the salt or the lite mayo I used. So, I would make and serve it fresh.

Liked the change from plain chicken salad.  Next time, I'll try the jalapeno pepper; some family members don't like anything hot!

Excellent and easy to make.  Recommend a bit more cilantro than the 1 tablespoon (we like cilantro).  Excellent on a crusty roll.  Made this with a Costco roasted turkey breast.

I personally hated this recipe, however others in the family liked it so I will rate it 3 stars.  I felt it was too salty, too weird in taste and unpalatable, however I am not a fan of peppers so that could be just be me.  I love turkey, but this just didn't cut it for me.

This was the perfect way to use leftover Christmas turkey. I followed the recipe only exchanging about a teaspoon of Sriracha sauce for the jalapeno and parsley for cilantro. I also added a couple cut up green onion. Yummy! Thanks Cindy!!

FANTASTIC!  Use fresh cilantro though, dried has no flavor.  And YES to the smoked turkey!!

This recipe is excellent.  I added some diced white onion and extra jalapeños.  I also used celery salt rather than fresh celery.  And I also used less salt than the recipe called for. This is a great way to use up turkey leftovers.

This was a terrific turkey salad to me. The only change I made was to add more mayo by using Hellman's Washabi mayo. Next time I might like to try adding some pecans, also. Thanks for a great & easy recipe!

I loved it Cindy.Now being a Texan and liking things a tad spicy, I also added 2 jalapenos AND a little roasted garlic, as well as a little red bell pepper..It was fantastic as you had it but just needed that extra "punch" for me..Thanx for putting it on this site.

This recipe was really easy and my husband absolutely adores it.  As he likes spicy food, we made this with 2 jalapeno peppers.  What a great way to use up leftover turkey!

This is an easy and delicious way to use leftover Thanksgiving Turkey!  There are a few simple changes that I'd recommend.  1: only use 1/2 tsp salt.  2: 1/2 Tbsp dried Cilantro.  3: I added 1/3 cup chopped onion, 1/3 cup chopped green bell pepper, and 1/3 cup chopped red bell pepper.  This added a little more flavor and color making an already wonderful salad into an amazing culinary masterpiece!!  Ok, that might be going a little far, but it was awesome.  My fiance and his mother loved it!  And she's not easy to please, lol!  :P   Thanks, Cindy!  :)

I made this with leftover turkey for my husband who is on a diet.  I also decreased the salt.  It was an easy recipe to make and a wonderful change from another winter soup.  I will make this often!!!

I didn't know how great this recipe was until a year later . The guys from hunting camp said " You are going to make that turkey salad again.....RIGHT ? "  We all loved it on bread , crackers , out of the bowl. I forgot to save Your recipe last year....But I positively won't forget now !  Thank You ( From 6 Turkey Hunters !)

This is really good, with a little bit of zip to it.  I made the recipe for six servings instead of 12 and used fresh chopped cilantro.  I added a couple of tablespoons of sweet onion and I only used 1/2 t. salt and 1/2 t. pepper.  As suggested by another chef, I served it on a toasted onion bun.

It was good, will probably make again.  Left out salt, just didn't need it.  I wasn't crazy about the sweet relish, but the jalapeno was a good change and not overpowering.

I added elbow noodles for starch instead of putting it on a rool. I added chopped cucumbers instead of dill relish. I did less salt and pepper. I put some onion in it, seasoned salt and some bell peppers instead of jalepenos. Delish!!

This is delicious. I used jarred jalapenos because they didn't have fresh at the grocery store. I also used 8 oz. of Greek yogurt in addition to the mayo. I left out the salt and pepper.  This one is a keeper!

How can you not like this?  Yum!  We had leftovers from a half turkey breast from Trader Joe's last night, and this looked like the perfect way to extend it.  I used fresh cilantro rather than dried and Tajin rather than jalapeno.  Otherwise, I did follow the recipe.  I used the other ingredients but am not sure of the measurements because I made it to suit our tastes.  Excellent!  Thanks, SYNDI111!

This will be my after-turkey day left over dish from now on.  I have to admit I modified, but only because I used what I had on hand; which really makes this a great dish.  Didn't have the jalapeno or relish, so I added chopped green onion and subbed the salt and pepper for Chicago Steak seasoning (with red/black peppers, garlic, salt, etc.)  YUM!

Six stars! My family loved it. I also omitted the salt and it was great. Will definetly make this again and again. Actually looking forward to leftover turkey.
