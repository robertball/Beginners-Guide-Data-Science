These are easy and DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used walnuts instead of pecans (tasted great)! Also, I didn't make the icing, I just spooned some jam into the thumbprints before popping them into the oven. These are going to be my new classic cookies. Thanks!!

Our family has made these and they are now an Easter "classic"-- we try to tell the kids these cookies are only for the grownups.  Plan on at least a double batch!!

These are excellent!  I also use walnuts instead of pecans.  I use orange marmalade, apricot, and raspberry preserves.  I make these every year for Christmas and it's a huge hit!

Yes, very delicious. My mom made these for Christmas every year growing up with one alteration - she uses vanilla frosting with food coloring to make them pretty and different colors.
