Yum....I was looking for a classic crumb cake and this was great, esp if you are a "more crumb. less cake" person. I added all crumbs to bake at once instead adding the rest later.  I'll add a little more cinnamon next time.

I've been making this cake for some time with a few tweaks.  I always use a 13 x 9 pan but add one and a half cans of Comstock fruit filling (cherry, blueberry and apple seem to always be the biggest hits) on top of the baked cake, then press the crumb mixture on top of that..and bake the rest of the way.  Thank you for jogging my memory about the vanilla extract.  Doing it from memory..the crumb mixture seemed to be missing something.  Now I know!  I get rave reviews on this fruit crumbcake at work!

I used to make this cake all the time and lost the recipe years ago.  Only difference - I use the "butter" cake mix.  This is the best crumb cake.  Thanks for posting.

I usually don't review but after seeing mixed reviews I had to say something. This cake is really good and very easy. If you can follow instructions, it won't be dry. How can people say it's dry but yet undercooked??  It was a hit at our town's spring block party.

This review is just for the crumb topping-- if you are interested in making the whole cake, read no further. I made this today because I had been dreaming of crumb cake, and really more about the crumb than the cake. I had some cherries on hand that were starting to become questionable in freshness, and so I made a cream-cheese cherry pound cake (recipe from cookrepublic.com) for the cake part. Then, when it was almost done baking, I sprinkled the crumb topping--ALL OF IT-- onto the top of the cake. After baking it for about ten minutes more with the heat turned up to 400 degrees to brown the top, I pulled the baked cake out of the oven and let it sit out for about two hours to cool and set. Then.......... I cut a slice for myself. Delicious! The crumb topping was perfect-- thick, crisp, slightly sweet, and slightly nutty in flavor. A new favorite!

I made this cake and it was gone in 2 hours.  I made a few changes.  I added ground clove and ground ginger to the crumble.  I also put pure pumpkin puree in between the layers.  Before I put the crumble on, I spread one large can of pumkin puree over the cake.  To the puree I had added the same spices plus a scant tsp of salt.  Everyone loved this version as well

This is a great recipe! The crumbs were easy, and they tasted delicious! I did change the recipe a bit, but nothing too big. Instead of using 1 1/2 cups butter, I used 1 cup margarine and 1/2 cup butter. Also, instead of using a boxed cake, I used a recipe for vanilla cake! The recipe was not from this site, but you coud use  a vanilla cake recipe from this site. I think it works better than a boxed cake mix. Overall, this recipe was a big success! Everybody enjoyed it, although the crumb was a little rich! It was still great though... It looked amazing and tasted even better! Thanks for the recipe! This is a keeper! Oh, and definetly use a 9x13 pan... not a jellyroll pan.

A little bland and way too many crumbs...  i added coffee instead of water and it gave it a bit more flavor.

I had to do a trial run first. I learned a lot from the first go around. You really need to use less flower for the crumbs and more butter when making the crumb topping. Other then that I love it!

This cake is soo good and better than expected.  I was nervous based on some of the reviews but decided to use it for a bake sale, it sold out and I was asked numerous times for the recipe. ... To be honest, I think some of the other reviewers just don't know how to follow a packaged cake recipe. I don't understand how the cake wouldn't be cooked.... check your oven temperature.   I did use margarine and more cinnamon which are part of the Footnotes - Cook's Notes
-I used a jellyroll pan
-Margarine - per cooks notes
-More cinnamon
-Followed cake mix package instruction (used butter cake mix)
-Made ALL of the crumbs including the 4 1/2 cups of flour (you just need to blend well) the margarine absorbs the four mixture)
-Yes there were a lot of crumbs, but that's what I wanted. 

PERFECT!!

My family and friends loved this cake. It was very simple.  I followed the recipe almost exactly -I did use Duncan Hines Butter cake mix and about 1/4 less crumbs and there was still a lot. This is a keeper!! (It goes great with coffee).

I made this twice - So here it goes....I think what is missing in the instructions is to melt the butter when making the crumb topping. Mix all the dry ingredients for the crumb topping first, then add extract and melted butter. Mix well and you will have nice big crumbs. The ratios of the ingredients are correct. I live in NY where you can find crumb cake in every bakery. This is what classic NY crumb cake tastes like. The other reviews that suggest pumpkin or all those other additions will not make a classic plain crumb cake.

The other thing is to use the jelly pan roll that is suggested. Nothing spills in the oven because you are cooking the cake  part till almost done. Once you add the crumbs, it will be higher than the pan sides , but it will sit on the cake - not spill over. Just put it in the oven straight. For me the amount of crumbs is just enough. I put all the crumbs on the cake and did not hold any back. It doesn't quite make sense to hold back crumbs and then add non browned crumbs to a finished cake. You do see the difference. In a jellyroll pan this will make a cake that is half cake and half crumb. When you cut it up it makes a lot of servings. About 24 squares. Use the yellow cake mix that is specified in the recipe also. It is not dry.

For the topping I did way less flour that it called for, more brown sugar and maybe a little less butter and added salt till it tasted right. For the people who say the cake part was dry... I have noticed butter recipe cake mixes always come out dryer and more bland than the yellow cake mixes so I would recommend the yellow cake mix vs the butter recipe box. Hope this helps! :)

Sheila - amazon has 12x18 jellyroll pan... http://www.amazon.com/Wilton-Jelly-Roll-Cookie-Inches/dp/B0000CFMLC

Lisa B - question but is your oven temp correct? Next time, just follow the cake mix instructions then add the topping last last few minutes of cooking time. Be sure to press down the crumbs into the cake.

The crumb texture will be more on the dry side but not too dry. Whether you choose to use butter or margarine, it will melt with the mixture in the oven.

Used 1/2C less flour and 2T cinnamon for crumb topping.
Baked in a 9x13 pan (overflowed first time in jelly roll pan).
Excellent crumb to cake ratio. It stayed moist for many days.

Too bad, I had high hopes for this cake. The cake did not cook all the way and most of the crumb topping sunk towards the middle. The outer edges were cooked but I had to thow this away. Cooked it in a 13x 9 glass dish, but followed everything else to a T. So disappointed this was a waste of money. I think I'll stick to crumb cake at my local coffee shop.

True, there is a ton, A TON, of crumb topping on this cake.  It wasn't nearly sweet enough for my liking though.  I would recommend cutting down the flour.  I used a butter cake mix.  I've read that this cake is bland, I would have to agree.  There's just something missing here.

Great cake.  I made this for my daughter's school bake sale and it was a huge hit.  I followed my cake mix instructions and added the crumbs when the cake was almost golden.   It 's still moist several days later.  Maybe the other reviewer didn't add enough butter? If you cut back on butter I would think you would cut back on the crumb ingredients as well. I will make again, soon! Thanks for the easy recipe!

Some suggestions to make this recipie the way you expect it to be: moist and delicious!  make your crumble before the cake so it ready to apply right away. I used a 12 x18 jelly roll pan and the cake was completely  done in 15 minutes. Second time I cooked it for 10. You must apply the crumble right away while the cake is slightly undercooked. Don't let the cake rest! The suggestion for margarine in the crumble is a good one. First time my crumble was on the dry side and stayed that way after baking. Second time I used less flour for a moister crumble while Keeping the  other ingredients the same  - combined with the he undercooked cake and an extra five minutes for the moister crumble, this was just what one would expect from the bakery. Thanks for the recipie!

This recipe was excellent.....the only thing I did add was a box of instant vanilla pudding to the cake mix.  I love moist cakes and the instant vanilla pudding makes it so moist!!  Also, I added all the crumb topping to the cake after baking 17 minutes in a 13x9 Wilton pan.  Absolutely amazing!!!

Good but not great.  I used a Betty Crocker Butter Recipe Cake Mix & only made/used one half of the topping which was more than enough for a 13 X 9 pan.  The crumb topping was good but the cake was a little dry.

Good recipe.  First time, I tried it in 2 round cake pans, but should have spread into 3.  It was still really good for such a simple recipe.

I was really excited to make this cake. Very dissappointed because it had no taste. Are you sure it's that much flour in the crumbs?? I have a huge sweet tooth and was anticipating a very sugary taste.

Very good.  No way was it too many crumbs....maybe if using a 13 X 9, but recipe calls for the jellyroll pan.   But, I was dreaming of the wonderful Crumb Squares from the (sadly) now closed Mattina's Bakery in Brick, NJ, and it just didn't measure up to that.  Used the jellyroll pan, bought the correct size on Amazon, and it  worked out fine.  Odd though, that photo shows a 9 X 13 pan??
Next time I plan to try using Duncan Hines Butter Cake mix, and throwing in a box of instant vanilla pudding to the cake mix.  Might also try margarine for crumbs rather that butter, but that seems like heresy to me!
Thanks for the recipe!

It was great. Decreased the crumbs a little. I also added canned cherries on top before the crumb topping. It was a huge hit!

This recipe is excellent.  My first time making a crumb cake and it turned out beautifully - very moist, with lots of crumbs.  If anything, I might add more crumbs next time. For the most part I followed the recipe - the yellow cake mix I bought was 15 ounces not 18 and I added a 5 ounce bag of vanilla pudding mix.  I also added caramel filled chocolate morsels to the cake - it turned out well but next time I might pass.  Definitely recommend the confectioner's sugar at the end.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this for my Christmas work party. Everyone raved about it! Only changes I made was 1 additional tbsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp more vanilla extract. Super delish! I miss NJ style crumb cake and now I can have it here in AZ! I am making it tonight as well, with my 13 y\o daughter! Happy New Years Eve!

DELISH! I used DH Moist Deluxe Butter mix and followed the instructions on the box. I was a little nervous making the crumb topping because it seemed very dry with all of the flour but the butter will melt and the end result is a wonderfully thick crumb topping. If you decide to reduce the amount of crumb topping remember to proportionately cut back the topping ingredients as they wont come out correctly - either too wet (not enough flour) or dry (not enough butter).  I also used a glass  9X13 dish.  Make sure you remember to grease the dish/pan.  I will bake this again.. maybe with fresh Fall apples? The topping reminds me of almost a 'crisp' topping, minus the oats. Regardless, it will be delicious as is.

the recommended jellyroll pan for the crumb cake was 18 x 12. Searched everywhere in columbus, Ohio for this size to no avail. Where is that size pan available? Sheila  (sbsloan@sbcglobal.net)

I made this in a 13 X 9 pan and I cut the topping down by 1/3.  I was very happy with the result. Very Moist, PLENTY of topping.  I did cook it a few minutes longer.

I have made this cake for years.  I like cake mixes with pudding included in them.  I've used many different flavored cake mixes, the favorite was always a good chocolate.  I always use a large cookie sheet with 2 inch sides, then each bite is half cake and half crumbs.  I always wanted to add fruit (pie topping) but wasn't sure if I had to bake the cake longer before adding it.  I was concerned it might get mushy.

This cake is delicious. Everyone loved it. I accidentally left out one stick of butter in the crumb topping though and it still turned out fantastic. Tons of crumbs! I think it would be really good also if apples were added under the crumbs. I think I will try that next time. I used a 13x9 pan.

The only thing I changed is the amount of Flour in the crumb mixture. it was more doughy than sweet like I think of the crumbs. Plus there is far more crumb than is needed. I cut back by 1.5 cups. This made it a little sweeter and a little sticky. Either way a great recipe!

Easy recipe but a little bland. I think I would change the cake to a lemon cake to punch it up a little bit. The topping really does make a lot; I didn't use all of it and still had a nice layer.

I need help to understand this recipe. First, I can't find a box of 18.25 oz cake mix, so I went with 15.25 box.

Second, butter is listed twice. Is the first instance supposed to be added to the cake mix? If so, that confused me because the 15.25 oz box doesn't call for butter. If not, then why do I add different measurements of butter twice?

I didn't add the 1/2 cup butter (1st instance of butter) and used 1.5 cups butter (2nd instance) and cut it into the flour and brown sugar. I added the other ingredients and couldn't come up with medium crumbs.

What am I missing? Was I supposed to add the water and the eggs? I did, but it turned it into a thick paste.

By far the best coffee cake I’ve ever tasted!!!
I got huge compliments from everyone at Christmas. One issue was when I had to spread the second half of the batter on top of thr cinnamon mixture. It did not want to spread. Does anyone have any tips on that?  Also has anyone ever froze it?  It makes a lot but would be great to have on hand.

Made this as written, as was good.  However, after reading reviews was going to add pureed pumpkin between cake  and crumb layer but had none.  I did find a jar of lemon curd, and put that on unbaked cake, then put crumb layer on and into oven.  Fantastic and moist!

I made the recipe as stated and used a French vanilla boxed cake mix.   I used double the cinnamon in the crumbs.   Sounds like a few of the complaints were because people used the instructions on the box and not the water, eggs and butter and vanilla as stated in the all recipes recipe :)

Very dry and bland. I’ll remake it with a few added extras from this exact recipe. FYI please cut the flour if your going to make this cake, it’s way to much flour.

Loved it! The cake portion turned out great, I used butter cake but I'm sure yellow tastes just as yummy. It was a bit dense and still flavorful and moist which is perfect for the crumb on top. The crumb came out great too. I had to add another 1/4 c butter to get everything to incorporate and I added some vanilla. If I do anything different next time I'll just add a little more sugar and salt to the topping. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the receipt although the cake was delicious. I think it could use a little bit more sugar and melted butter. It was dry.

IF I were going to make this again, I would use FAR less flour in the crumb topping.  My 'cake' was non-existent but 100% crumb topping.  Made for my inlaws and had to rush to store to buy a cake as this was inedible.  Not enough sugar to flour ratio so not even sweet.   I would ask if the crumb topping ingredients were listed properly, and if so, I cannot recommend the recipe.  Sorry.  Looks and sounds good so what did I do wrong?

This is my 3rd time making this,  it comes out perfect every time. The only thing I have changed was to put the all the crumbs on before putting it  back in the oven. Delicious cake.

This is a great recipe, even though I made some adjustments, one of which I won't repeat next time. I used ginger ale instead of water, because I had it on hand; not sure if it added any flavor since it was only 2/3 c, but didn't hurt. For convenience, I placed the crumbs on the cake at the beginning of cooking; this is the step I would not repeat next time as the crumbs were on the dry side (not the cake, just the crumbs).  Delicious still, but  a more "gooey" texture like in one of the photos would probably be even better, for this volume of crumbs.  I reduced the crumb ingredients as I was low on butter, which was lucky for me as, even the reduced amount barely fit on the cake using my largest sheet pan. (It must be only 10  x 15?)  I have to wonder if the full amount would fit in my 9 x 13 cake pan. For the crumbs I used: 3 c flour, 1 c brown sugar, 1/2 c granulated sugar, 2 sticks butter,  5 tsp cinnamon, 1 T vanilla, and about 1 and 1/4 c chopped pecans. The pecans were a great addition, they added a LOT of flavor, and the cinnamon/sweetness seemed just right as the cake is not very sweet. Tasted great but next time I will add more butter to the crumb ratio, or not place the crumbs until after the cake has been pre-cooked as in the recipe directions, or both. Still it is delicious; probably can't really mess this one up; great recipe, thanks!

This was a good crumb cake but mine tasted a little bland.  I will use less flour, as someone else said, next time.  But it is easy and yummy all the same.

As close to perfect as it goes. I might add more spice next time, it was mild, but nevertheless, gone in short order. This is a keeper.  And really - so easy.

I made this with 1 1/2 mixes. 325 25mins.  Then added crumb for 20mins. Followed the rest of the recipe with exception of 2x cinnamon & stick margarine for the crumb. We'll see how it is tomorrow when I serve it.

I had a cake mix on hand, but no icing. What a great recipe! There is no such thing as "too many" crumbs for us. This would be great for a breakfast, brunch, or dessert. We had it as dessert and with coffee the next morning!

Made this cake 4 times already! Each time gone in less than a day!  The last 2 times I added a simple glaze to hold the crumbs on a little more.  Anyone who says this cake is dry must not be reading the directions properly!!

I thought it was good but I felt that the crumb topping had too much flour and not enough brown sugar.  It is also a ridiculous amount of crumb topping for a 9 x 13 cake.  I will experiment with the amounts when I make it next.  I used a Duncan Hines yellow butter cake mix and followed directions and it was moist and delicious, but the crumb topping looked a little anemic and was on the dry side.  It was well received but I am going to fiddle with the crumb topping next time.

I made this the other day. This is really just a review for the crumbs. I love crumb cakes that are more crumb than cake and was really excited for this, but it was disappointing. It came out much more bland than I hoped.  The amount of crumb is excellent for crumb-lovers, but they were bland.  I agree with other users who say it tastes like "something is missing." I even added more cinnamon and brown sugar and it was still not as flavorful as I'd hoped. In honesty, I like Trader Joe's coffee crumb cake mix better. Who knew!

Made this for Christmas one year.  My family has always rather eat the crumb than the cake.  It was such a huge hit that this past year I had to make 3; one for guests, one for my parents and one for my in laws.  The cake is so moist!!!

I think next time I will make the cake the way the box says vs following the recipe, and will prob sub butter cake mix vs yellow it didn't rise like I wanted it to. Also my crumbs came out too dry. Could be because it was my 1st time but I'm known for my cakes and this did not represent me well at all. But with a few adjustments I think I can make it work for next time.
