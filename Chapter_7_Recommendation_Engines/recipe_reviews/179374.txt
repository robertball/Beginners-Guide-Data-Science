I used the low-fat Bisquick, and the pancakes were delicious!

I love this recipe and it is so easy.  I didn't have enough buttermilk so I used the vanilla flavored yogurt I had on hand.  They turned out perfect, so fluffy.  The grandchildren loved them too.  They freeze good too and warm up nicely in the microwave for a quick breakfast.

Way to thick. I had to add extra milk. It came out tasting more like buttermilk biscuits than pancakes.

We added a lil box of blueberries, this recipe is simple and delish!  It was quite thick tho, so my husband wants to use 2 cups of buttermilk next time. . .

i don't understand how this recipe was too thick for some people, as it was much, much too thin for me.  but on my second attempt, i used only one cup of buttermilk, and two eggs instead of just one...  simply, simply perfect.
