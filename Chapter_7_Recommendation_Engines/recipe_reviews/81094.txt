Very tasty! I used onion salt instead of fresh onions. I also created a glaze on top with extra ketchup and BBQ sauce.

Awesome flavor- I actually made 4 mini meatloves from different recipes from this website to see which one we liked best and this one was the best by far.  Next time I think I'll make it with the glaze from Glazed Meatloaf I.  Best meatloaf recipe I have ever made!

WONDERFUL!! My absolute favorite meatloaf recipe.  I do have to make some adjustments, so my picky husband will eat it.  I add green peppers which I puree with the onion (since I don't want it to liquidy, I use only half of each).  I leave out the ketchup and barbeque sause. and I add dry beefy onion soup mix (which I strain and add the onions to to the top). It comes out wonderful! The brown sugar makes it so sweet and tasty. I will make this again and again!!!

My family of four gobbled this up-it was great! Definately has a sweet flavor, and I might cut back on the brown sugar next time. You won't need any type of "gravy" with this meatloaf.

What a great option for my picky boyfriend who does not like anything too tomato-y.  We LOVED this recipe.  Thank you, KMSOUTHERN!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out mushy.  The second time I followed some of the other reviews and made a few revisions of my own. I added a packet of onion soup mix, beef boulion granules, 1/3 c extra bread crumbs, 1/4 lb extra ground beef, extra onion powder, garlic powder, season salt and italian seasoning. I also added some french fried onions on top in the last ten minutes of baking.  It was EXCELLENT! Texture was perfect and the taste was wonderful.  My husband doesn't like ketchup on top, so this worked out great!  Thanks for sharing!

Oh my Gosh ..This is so so good. I add a dash of mrs dash. Since I found this recipe a few years back I have made it a few dozens times.I also put cheese on the top of the meatloaf about 5 mins before it is done. Yummy melted cheese.

love it.  I left out the cheese only because I was distracted and forgot it.  This meatloaf is very moist and has a nice sweetness.

Great combination of flavors!  I added a bit more bread crumbs than called for, and ground sirloin helped to make texture a bit more firm, but still less "loafy" than other recipes.  Not a problem though.  Will probably try it again soon, possibly w/ some more veggies, such as green peppers, corn, etc...

Could be very good if the liquid ingredients & brown sugar were cut in half. No need for seasoned salt either

Make the best meatloaf I've ever had. The only thing different that I did was replace half the steak sauce with more BBQ sauce. Also it's like chili the longer it sits in the refridge the better it tastes (not that it lasts that long).

It was a little softer than most meatloaf, but the flavor was amazing! The next day I sliced it up and pan fried it.  Even better!

The recipe I use is VERY much like this one. This is great because you can make it with turkey too! I gave this recipe to just about everyone I know, and they've all loved it.  My Fiance has me make this for him at least once every couple of weeks. :)

Made the recipe exactly and found it waaayy too sweet.  Tried it a second time, leaving out the brown sugar, and was still a little too sweet for my taste but ok, palatable.

I have tried to update this recipe for a while, but it will not save my changes.  I always use 93% lean ground beef, so that might be why some are having mushy meatloaf. I made it with 73% lean once for my mom and it was quite mushy...still tasted great, but it didn't hold its shape well.  I'd definitely recommend a leaner ground beef. I also started adding french fried onion rings when I have them around and it is a nice addition.

The ingredients overpowered the meat.  If this was mixed together with 2 pounds of beef it might be better.  No one was a fan.

The flavor of this meatloaf was great.  The texture left something to be desired, however.  I believe the next time I make this, I will simply add more hamburger to the rest of the ingredients, to get a firmer texture.

I've been looking for a meatloaf recipe to add to our menu for a while. I've tried a few others on here and none compared to this one!! This one is a keeper, there were no leftovers and my 2 yr old and hubby both gobbled it up!! Thanks so much for sharing!

Greatly enjoyed the cheddar cheese flavor and the subtle taste of the bbq sauce. However, texture came out kind of mushy even though thoroughly cooked. But over all, great!

Fair meatloaf, though it did turn out a little too wet for my taste. I liked the flavor of it though it did seem to be missing a little something. When I make this again, I'll play around with the liquids (maybe cut back just a touch on the ketchup?) and add in a few spices. It made a smallish meatloaf so one meatloaf fed my whole family (my husband ate three pieces).

this recipe is almost exactly like mine ive been making for years. one tip for those of you who didnt like mushiness is to use a bigger pan than the loaf. (the fat needs somewhere to escape to) center the loaf in the pan and use a turkey baster to suck out the fat once or twice during cook time. the bread crumbs and egg hold just enough moisture to make it perfect!

I made this recipe using ground venison because  we were out of ground beef.  My husband does not care for sweet entres, so I left out the 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  It was very good. Enough sugar in the ketchup and bbq sauce for our taste. We will make again.

Flavor was wonderful but was mushy! I will try adding another egg and more bread crumbs or oatmeal next time that should help!

A girl at work made this and I had to have the recipe. I love this meatloaf (and I hated it as a child) I have never made one without a glaze on top before, but it was really good. I used ground turkey instead of beef and it was still very good. I can't wait to make it again!

The flavor was amazing and we loved it. It was super soft, though ... so be careful when serving.

Very good! The hubby and the kids loved it.  I did have to make with out the worcertershire sauce (was all out) but it was still good.  Think the husband told me 4 times how good it was.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent! The only thing I changed was that I omitted the steak sauce, because I didn't have any.  I loved the sweet/tangy flavor.  I'll definately be making this again!

Good meatloaf.  Instead of ketchup, I used Heintz Chili Sauce for some kick and I omitted the cheese.  Everything else was the same.

All I can say is yum. This is my favorite meatloaf by far, it has a great flavor. It doesn't hold its shape, but who cares when it tastes this good!

I haven't made meat loaf for a really long time and thought I would do this for something different. Everyone enjoyed it and my son even ate the left overs the next day.

Wonderful flavor, but mine came out a bit soggy.  Maybe my fault - perhaps not mixing ingredients well enough?  Liked the flavor so much I will try again and hope for a better consistency.

I am not a meatloaf fan, but this was pretty yummy, and my hubby LOVED it!  To me, it tasted like sloppy joe loaf, and I liked the flavor much better than other meatloaves I've had.

My family loved this. I did substitute a little. I didn't have any ketchup (Can you believe it!) so I used tomato sauce and added about a tsp of apple cider vinegar. I also used cheese nips instead of the bread crumbs. It was awesome!

This is delicious!  The only changes I made were:  1.  I used Italian Seasoning instead of parsley (b/c that's all I had), 2.  I took other people's advice and omitted the seasoned salt (glad I did, b/c the other ingredients have PLENTY of flavor and salt).  This is so moist, better than any meatloaf I've ever had - DE-LISH!!!

This is the best meatloaf. I never had "sweet" meatloaf, however this one does have a sweet,unique taste, and its absolutely delicious.  Everyone in the house agrees.  I've since forgotten about my other meatloaf recipes.  And I usually mix/measure/prep everything the day before to save time.  Try it...at least once!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My parents absolutely love this meatloaf.  They said it was the best thing they ever had, and I have to agree with them.  there wasn't even a crumb left when we were done.

This is a keeper for us. I followed the directions to a 'T' except I left out the onions (personal preferance) The flavor was great and I didn't have problems with it being soggy or falling apart like some others mentioned.

The taste of this meatloaf was bland! It also fell apart even though I added extra breadcrumbs. My family asked me not to make this again. The leftovers were leftover because they were like mush.

I thought that this was a pretty darn good meatloaf. My one problem was that it was so soft. It crumbled out of its meatloaf form vey easily. The reason this doesn not get four stars is because my husband hated it. He stated that it was not even close to the best meatloaf I have made. All in all its good for family but dont make it for company. It had no presentation value.

This was ok. After reading all the reviews I was expecting it to be better. There are other meatloaf recipes here (like the Rempel one) that are a lot better.
