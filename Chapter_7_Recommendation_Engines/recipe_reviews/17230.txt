This is a very good pie, and does resemble pecan pie in appearance. It is delicious tasting though I don't think I could fool anyone into believing it is pecan pie. My husband is allergic to pecans though and it was a nice substitute that we both could enjoy.

I found this recipe in a church ccokbook and used to make it for my husband and children. They loved it! I lost the book and my home in a fire.  So happy to find it again. My sons, now grown, will be so happy.  Thank you! If you want nuts...adding walnuts is good.

This recipe was so extremely easy to prepare! Although mine did not taste like a pecan pie, it still has a very yummy flavor!! It did somewhat resemble a pecan pie after being baked. Overall--this is a great recipe to keep in your kitchen. Especially for pre-teens just learning to bake!!

This was very yummy! No, it doesn't taste quite like pecan pie, but it's delicious none the less. My store only had 9" pie crusts, so I used that, but will search harder for the 8" next time. This couldn't be easier to prepare! I will make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very easy and great tasting.  I decreased the white sugar in half because I used sweetened coconut.  It was perfectly sweet.  I needed to cook mine for about 40 minutes.  When checking for "doneness", the pie should only slightly jiggle when moved.  Allow the pie to completely cook before cutting.  We kept in fridge to help keep it firm.

I wasn't sure if I should use light or dark brown sugar, so I tried it with both. I think the light brown was better, because it seemed less sweet.

I love It!  I have this issue like the taste of pecans but don't like to bite into them.  Some sort of OCD I guess, so I made this exactly except without the coconut and grinded a cup of pecans and that worked out perfectly.  I left some oats, brown sugar and grinded pecans to spread on the top and it was delicious!  Tasted just like pecan pie but without me having to bite into the nuts...
