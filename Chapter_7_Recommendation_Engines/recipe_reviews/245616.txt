Delicious! We added a little turmeric and crushed red pepper to the wet masala. We served it over rice with chopped cilantro. Iâ€™m excited to try it with a touch of coconut cream the next time we make it!

It was delish!

I made substitutions just because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used 1/2 coconut milk, 1/2  silk milk and added no peppers, green beans or vinegar. My family loved it.

Spice combinations are perfect!

I will likely make this again, but with changes...1/2 coconut milk/1/2 water, chili powder and less allspice, if any at all.
