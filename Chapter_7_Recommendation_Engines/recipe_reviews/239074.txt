I made this for a meatloaf I was preparing. I wasn't sure if I could place the sauce onto the meatloaf as it cooked so I placed half of this recipe on half of the meatloaf the last 15 minutes.  I kept the remaining half for dipping. Once the meatloaf was cooked, the sauce did not dilute and blended well with the meatloaf.  Though everyone liked it, it was a wee bit sweet for our taste buds but was highly recommended to make again. If you like sweet, stay with the recommended 6 tablespoons (I used light brown sugar), but in the future I will use 4 1/2 and I think that would be suffice for my family.

I dont know why more people have not reviewed this. This sauce/topping can be found on a kinda-bland recipe that uses Saltines instead of bread but this sauce is AMAZING..something about the nutmeg makes it yummy. Do NOT add more nutmeg or it starts to taste weird- keep the proportions exactly as written double if needed.

Great starting point!  Next time I'll tweak it a bit for my taste, a little too sweet for me.  Will definitely use this again!
