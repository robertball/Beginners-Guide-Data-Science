Being Trinidadian myself I can give a bit more imput into this recipe. We make this hugely popular dish very often and it can be done with variations. I have never heard of using coconut milk in stewed chicken that's usually in curries, You can omit the coconut milk for a very lowfat dish and use chicken broth instead. We usually blend (in blender or food processor)our seasonings such as cilantro, green onions, lots of garlic, a little water or vinegar to moisten and preserve  spanish thyme and of course hot peppers TO TASTE if you can take it. We marinate like some of the comments said longer, overnight is good. We brown just like the recipe said but even even longer than two minutes don't be afraid to really brown as long as you stir it and it does not burn, however I personally use about two tablespoons of sugar or you can also use a few drops of browning such as Benjamin's which comes in a bottle (it is caramelized sugar) or Gravy Master. As you brown adding a little ketchup and soy sauce then add water(or broth), chopped onions, and diced potatoes which thicken, then simmer for 1/2 hour to forty mins and then add a little cornstarch mixed with water toward the end to thicken. It will have a different flavor from original recipe if you omit the coconut milk. As a variation we also stew beef and pork cubes the same way, just cook longer, very delicious. ( a shot of rum in the marinating meat is great and if you like ginger a little bit of it grated is good too).

With Trini roots, I found this recipe to be very much like what I am use to cooking. The only difference is that I mix the green onion, cilantro, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper....along with fresh thyme in a food processor with about 1T olive oil till it becomes a paste. Then, I rub it into the chicken and marinate it overnight. I also use the rest of the coconut milk mixed w/water to make herbed dumplings (not the kind w/baking powder....I like mine chewy and dense for this dish). Serve w/rice or with doubles (trini delicacy). Mmmmmmm.

This is extremely good.  I used boneless chicken, breasts & thighs and it came out great.  I added a bit more red pepper, and more garlic.  This is now on my kids (teens) most requested list.  I've found that soaking/marinating the meat much longer than 30 minutes is best.  I've never yet used a full bone-in chicken, which I suppose has a lot more flavor than boneless, skinless, thighs and breasts. Therefore, doctoring even further is good.  Also, the sauce tends to be thin because everyone adds the whole can of broth and the whole can of coconut milk.  If you do that, you need to double the initial step with the brown sugar mixture at the beginning.  Make sure to serve with an overabundance of jasmine rice cooked with chicken broth and spiked with cilantro, and green onion and red pepper to taste.  All of the optional steps shouldn't be optional.  They make the dish.  Don't skip.

This is not really a traditional trini stew chicken. it looks too pale. tradition stew chicken is normally a deeper brown and that is because the sugar is allowed to brown and not just melt as instructed by this recipe. then the butter is absolutely unnecessary. with the vegetable oil and cocnut milk you are just adding too much fat without adding flavour. To cut colries and fat even more the vegetable oil can even be eliminated just put the sugar to brown in the pot and then throw in the chicken, then add the cocnut milk etc..

OMG, was this ever good!  I only needed 4 servings, so halved the amount of chicken (used skinless thighs), but made the full amount of sauce.  It was great over rice.   I had a little trouble with the brown sugar and oil initially.  The burner must have been too hot, so the brown sugar turned hard as a rock almost instantly.  I redid it at low heat and it worked fine.  I'm sending this recipe to everyone I know.  It is a new favorite at my house!

All the ingredients incorporated really well together making this a very flavorful dish. I made a couple of changes; omitted the garlic, replaced the cilantro with parsley and added some lime zest and lime juice to the chicken marinate. The lime juice adds some tanginess to the dish. We served it with coconut rice which is a very nice compliment. We loved it and will definitely make this again.

We loved this dish! I used  chicken breasts, cut into large cubes, used cilantro in a tube, added onion powder & eliminated the green onion & squeezed the juice from a lime over the chicken to marinade. To the sauce, I added baby carrots, used half coconut milk & half chicken broth for the water & I completely forgot the ketchup & butter. LOL I served this w/ jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth & coconut milk w/ mango slices alongside. I garnished w/ chopped parsley & a chive blossom bloom. I loved the pretty colors! The green from the parsley, orange from the carrots, yellow from the mango & purple from the chive blossom was just beautiful! Thanks for a great recipe  MASONBROWNE!

I would give this recipe 10 stars.  Rarely do I find a recipe that I will make again and again.  OMG this is good!  I too omitted the water and added a whole can of coconut milk.  Thank you!

This chicken is awesome. I used boneless chicken thighs and followed the recipe except I used the whole can of coconut milk instead of half coconut milk and half water. I dont like cilantro or green onions but I decided to give it a try. I think next time I will leave it out but it was awesome. I did notice however that when I was melting the brown sugar and oil, I put the cold marinated chicken in the pot and the brown sugar hardened so next time I would not put cold chicken right into the sauce.

This was sooooooo good and so easy!  It tasted just like takeout, yet I hardly spent any time or trouble preparing it.  I used cubed chicken breast and almost the whole can of coconut milk (omitted the water).  I also added a dash of hot chili sauce.  Served with steamed jasmine rice.  You have to try this!

Really Like this recipe.  My family keeps having me make it again in and again.  After looking at some of the suggestions, I too now make a paste in the blender and rub into the chicken.  Marinate MUCH MUCH longer.  Brown and cook a lot longer too.  Tastey dish.

Haven't tried this but a fried of mine called me and said this is the recipe she was using. Being Trinidadian I told her that although she could add the coconut milk it's not a norm. I also told her that when she's browning the sugar she needs to wait for all of the sugar to begin "frothing" in the oil and for it to not get too black. It's a fine line between being horribly sweet or bitterly burnt. Apparently the meal was a hit with her guests but she said that next time she'd add more pepper (told her to try adding half a scotch bonnet to the marinade) and would skip the coconut milk.

This was fantastic!!  Every bit of chicken and the sauce was gobbled up!  I did have a bit more chopped onion (like half of a small one) but otherwise had everything the same.  One more thing should be added to the instructions though, when the chicken is ready, uncover the pot, put the heat up to high and let the sauce reduce and thicken for a few minutes.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

I'm not a fan of bone-in chicken, so I made this with chicken breasts cut into bite-size pieces. I added more red pepper flakes, and garnished the finished dish with snipped fresh cilantro. This was a tasty and easy recipe. Thanks!

Soooo good! The whole family cleaned their plates and this is a rare happening in our house. I doubled the sauce (spices, chicken broth instead of water, coconut milk, ketchup, garlic, onions) and it came out moist and just delicious. The sauce is great over rice also. Thanks so much. Next time I might add hot sauce because I love spicy but this is a good recipe as is, even without a lot of heat. YUM!

Sounds very tasty especially with the coconut milk, here in San Diego its a little difficult to get the right ingredients for a good Trini cookup, so we go to any Mexican veggie store and WALLA ..seasoning heaven , shaddon benny and all !!! ,  When you first put the chicken in the pot it will spring allot of its own water, the key is to allow all of that liquid to burn out until the pot is completly dry Turn and tumble the chicken in the pot almost like you"re frying it then all your coconut milk or water to suit your taste....Just a little food for thought !!

I dont know what this is but it is definitely not trinidadian stewed chicken, stewed chicken does not contain any coconut milk or the butter at the end.  please follow myrts78 recommendation for authentic trinidad stewed chicken.

I added half a bunch of cilantro, half a bunch of green onion, half a medium onion, a little bit of olive oil and put it through my mini cuisinart to make into a paste. Marinated the chicken for about 4 hours (I used skin on whole chicken cut into parts). The first day I made it, it was great; not excellent. Like one other reviewer, I was wary about adding the ketchup. I put aside some sauce in a cup and added a tsp of ketchup, mixed it and tasted it and it was so good. I then proceeded and added ketchup to the whole pot.  The next day, I tasted this dish and it was EXCELLENT. Like with all other stews I make, this one tasted soooo much better the next day. All the flavors have lots of time to marry! This is now a dish in my repertoire and a favorite. I'm craving it again already!  I'd also like to add that I doubled the sauce recipe but kept the brown sugar down to 3-4 T. Any more and I think it would have been too sweet.  I also used a whole can of coconut milk and a whole can of chicken broth, omitting the water.

PHENOMENAL. This recipe is easy to make (even an inexperienced college student like me can cook it) and extremely delicious! I am in danger of overeating, even while I wish that I had made more. I am absolutely impressed, and this will definitely be one of my go-to recipes in the near future.

You can notice the sweetness from the sugar in the final dish. I will add perhaps double the black pepper the next time I make it for more spice. Garnish with fresh cilantro -- it adds more zing to the final product!

Delicious and a breeze to make. Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

This recipie is good, but although it has many of the right ingredients, the execution isn't like true Trinidad-style stewed chicken. The marinade is supposed to be blended into a paste or green seasoning made with culantro (not cilantro), green onions, and garlic which makes it more flavorful. It is also traditionally made with only dark meat that is bone in and cut into small pieces. The picture is a mis-representation, so maybe it should be renamed "Caribbean Stewed Chicken"

This was really great! My hubby wrapped his chicken pieces in a flour tortilla, he said it was almost like a favored dish he called "roti" that was sold by the street vendors when he lived in St. Croix. Next time I will make the roti bread and wrap mine too. I served this with Puerto Rican steamed rice. We all had 2 servings, this was so good! When I first added the chicken to the pan, the sugar hardened into giant clumps and stuck to my wooden spoon, but I pried them loose and they melted back down again. No one else has commented about this occurance. Everything turned out great! I used the entire can of "light" coconut milk instead of water. I did add a little cornstarch to thicken the gravy a little at the end. This one will be a regular at our house now. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU Masonbrowne, for posting this!

I made this for my parents over the weekend and they both loved it.  I omitted the water and used an entire can of coconut milk instead.  It turned out very creamy and spicy-sweet.

This had a great flavor! I substituted tomato paste for ketchup, as we like the taste better.  Made a little less sauce for the rice than I would have liked, but that might have been my not-so-exact measurements.

I made it the way the recipe called for and it was not that great and that's why I gave it three stars HOWEVER I saw the potential and remade it with some changes. First when putting on your rub I would suggest not for 30 minutes but rather overbite. I also added fresh ginger to it. When melting brown sugar do it without the oil and brown the chicken in a separate frypan using olive oil and no. Vegetable oil.  Use a full can of coconut milk. Recipe says optional but I think the coconut milk is crucial. Do not use ketchup. Instead tomato paste. Add the juice of one like before cooking chicken in the mixture AND use 1/2 stick of butter. Finally cook the chicken in a Dutch oven at 375. These changes make it perfect and FIVE stars in my book.

Excellent. I'm from Trinidad and we do it both ways with and without the coconut milk. I personally prefer it with the coconut milk.

This was soooo good! I followed the recipe almost exactly but used chicken broth instead of water and added hot peppers when I browned the chicken. My husband (who is very picky) really liked it. So delish!!!!

This was delicious! I am not cook and I am not familiar with Trinidad food. I made this quick because I had no time (I didn't marinade the chicken more than 10 min) and my husband and I LOVED it! I also threw in some steamed zucchini, squash, carrots, and broccoli. There was enough sauce to nicely coat it all and plenty to go over the rice. It was a 5 star dinner! Thank you!

I really loved this dish. Just finished making it for dinner. I took the advice of MYRTS78 and put the seasonings in a blender and marinating it overnight. The meat was very tender and had lots of flavor. I wanted it spicier but b/c I had other members eating it that cannot eat too much spicy food, I had to limit the amount of red pepper flakes. I definitely will be making this again.

awesome recipe! I used cubed chicken breasts, and I only marinated for the 1/2 hour suggested because I was short on time. I added 3/4 of a can of coconut milk, and some extra cilantro. I didn't have red pepper flakes, so i used some hot sauce to taste. I let it boil longer than the 10 min suggested because it was so watery, and ended up adding a little flour to thicken it. Came out great!!

This recipe was great and from what I've tasted from West Indian homes, this is pretty authentic. I don't use coconut milk though and I let the chicken marinate overnight. I let it boil for a good hour or more if I can it softens the meat more and gets the flavors really nice. Oh and by the way, I noticed a lot of people were putting this over basmati rice. West Indian homes usually accompany this with rice and beans (def. not basmati), boiled veggies, etc.

I've tried this recipe twice.  Turned out pretty good, my husband thought it was great but it was a bit sweeter than I thought stewed chicken should be.  I do realize that the recipe is for 8 servings and I only made 4 servings so maybe next time I'll decrease the brown sugar.

Wow this was great! Family loved it and has requested over and over! Used chicken breasts and skipped the coconut milk. The brown sugar did harden up when I added the chicken but it eventually melted again after the chicken heated up. Served over jasmine rice. It's a keeper - thanks for sharing.

We loved this chicken!  I purchased a whole chicken and this recipe was perfect.  I added everything except the crush pepper flakes and I do not think this recipe can get any better.  I always have rice as a side and I use the remaining coconut milk to flavor the rice. I have recommended this to my other "cooker" friends and family and everyone raves about it.  THANKS!

My husband said "interesting", and didn't ask for seconds.  It was too sweet for us, and when cooking my brown sugar kept clumping up, it never really developed into a syrup.

Very tasty, rich and nice, but thought it was too sweet. Would cut the brown sugar to half of a quarter cup next time. And, would definitely recommend the chilli flakes; it's listed as optional on the ingredients, but it is really a must because I think the spice would be good to cut the sweetness. I didn't use any coconut milk and used skinless thigh fillets. The chicken turned out very tender. Beautiful.

Really amazing recipe. Normally I find myself tweeking recipes as I make them but this is one you don't really need to. I took some of the reviewers advice and used chicken broth instead of water and I added peas to the mix for a veggie. Fantastic. Will definately make again!

This was delicious! It actually reminded me more of an Asian dish than a Trini dish, but I'm not Asian or Trini, so who knows. I used Jasmine Rice with it, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and did not have time to marinate the chicken, but this was still delicious and will be made again!

great recipe! a couple suggestions:

1) I could not get my brown syrup/oil mixture to turn syrupy, so after a few frustrating tries, i added a bit (about 2 TBS of hot water and it worked beautifully. 

2) I added olive oil to the garlic/onion/cilantro marinade so it was a bit wetter when marinating. 

3) the coconut milk and red pepper flakes are not optional! they make the dish amazing!

4) serve with rice. It is a wonderful complement to the dish.

Oh my! This was absolutely delicious.  I didn't want to go to the store so I defrosted a bag of wings and three boneless chicken breasts to stew. I changed the marinade only be adding about a half of jalopena pepper, and I made a paste of the ingredients with a bit of olive oil.  I browned the chicken in batches in a bit more veg oil and brown sugar.  And I cooked it covered for a bit longer than the recipe called for.  This recipe reminds me why I love cooking in cooler weather.  I will definitely be cooking Trinidad Stewed Chicken again.  A great company meal.  Kudos to you, MASONBROWNE!

We make this recipe at 3-4 times per month.  Everyone in our house LOVES it.  I've prepared it using boneless skinless chicken breasts; chicken thighs (boneless once; bone-in another); and as written with the whole chicken (minus skin).  It is good every time!  It's even better the next day, if there is any leftover!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I should have read "spicy" in the description. Too hot for my kids. Adults loved it. Subbed 2 1/2 pounds boneless thighs. Made a paste of onion, cilantro, garlic, salt, pepper, added fresh rosemary and vegetable oil. Then marinated overnight. Lovely flavor. Would be good over rice or pasta or potatoes.

I guess I'll throw my 5-star two cents in, too.  We had this for dinner last night, and before I'd even taken a bite, everybody was raving!  Husband wished I'd doubled the rice so he could keep eating the sauce.  I made two alterations: didn't use white onion (picky child won't eat cooked onions, but he doesn't seem to mind cooked green onions) so I increased the green onion a little, and used 1/2 cup chicken broth in place of 1/2 cup water (wanted to get rid of it from my frig).  My only complaint was that there seemed to be an excessive amount of fat floating on top of the sauce.  We will make this again, but make the following changes:  boneless, skinless chicken, cubed; light coconut milk; little to no butter (maybe just a teaspoon for flavor).

Fabulous recipe!  I made several changes in line with previous reviewers' suggestions.  Minced onion in place of the green and white onions; dried cilantro instead of fresh; an entire can of coconut milk, and just 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper.  I also added some chunk pineapple and the Cascadian organic stir-fry vegetables.  For the marinating process, I placed the minced onion, cilantro, garlic, salt and pepper into a large Ziploc bag and dropped the chicken pieces (sliced boneless breast) into the mixture, then closed the bag and shook it before putting it in the refrigerator.  Our meal was 4 servings, but we ate just about all of it -- me, my husband and our 3-year-old son.    I don't know how this could get any better, but I am willing to omit the water and add some lime juice to the marinade next time.  It's fantastic with Basmati rice and mashed sweet potatoes.  Bravo, Mason!!

This dish was excellent.  I used cubed chicken breast, and less than what was called for in the recipe so there would be plenty of gravy, and I also used almost a full can of coconut milk, a little lemon juice, and a couple spoons of curry powder for a little kick.

Fantastic recipe. It's very rare that I make a recipe and think to myself that it could be served in a restaurant. This one fit that bill. I followed the advice of my fellow reviewers and added a full can of coconut milk, omitting the water. I also tossed in some carrots when I added the coconut milk. I served the chicken over jasmine rice, and it was just wonderful. I mentioned to my wife that I might add some curry powder next time, and she quickly told me that the recipe was perfect the way it was. That's high praise!

The flavor is great, but for some reason the "gravy" didn't turn out thick at all, but very runny. Nobody else seems to have had this problem.

This recipe is awesome.  I usually don't like whole pieces of chicken, but I used 4 chicken breast halves and kept the same amount of sauce so there would be plenty of extra to pour over the rice.  It didn't turn out dry or bland in the middle of the breast meat like most dishes that use whole pieces of chicken do.  I also threw in some crushed pineapple I had left over, and it added a very nice flavor and texture to the meal.

really tasty stuff! made a few adjustments: used 2 whole chicken breasts (sliced 1/2 inch thick), eliminated the green onion and instead marinated with 1/4 cup minced onion, used 1/2 cup water and a whole can (14oz) coconut milk. cut the cooking time from 20-30min to 5 min (sliced chicken breast cooks real fast)...and at the very end, threw in a small bag of frozen vegetables (i happened to have a bag of stir-fry vegetables...Cascadian Farm organic). delish, and good for ya!

Easy to prepare, inexpensive, and so full of flavor! It was just the right blend of sweet and spicy. I served it with Basmati rice and sweet potatoes and the flavors blended perfectly.

I thought it was a weird combination of spices, but everything blended together very well.  It was so flavorful!  And it's great the second night too.

Naturally Gluten, Dairy, and Soy free... perfect my family! Made the recipe as written with one exception, I left out the onion and just used extra green onion. It came out great! Served it with Chef John's Persian Rice.

I've made this recipe several times. The only modification I made is I added the coconut milk to the marinade and instead of discarding the marinade I add it to the pot after the chicken browns in the brown sugar. I then simmer for another 30-40 mins. LOVE IT!

This recipe was great! I intended on making curry chicken first but I ran out of curry. I found this recipe and read MYRTS78 and TW's review before I made it. I browned my sugar longer to get a nice brown color on the chicken as suggested by the other reviews. I also put my cilantro, minced garlic, onion and vinegar to make the marinade in the blender as one of them suggested. I did not use coconut milk because I did not have any but it is on my grocery list. I cant wait to try it! I put my own twist on it with some chunks of onion, bell pepper, carrots, and jalepeno in with the chicken also. I made black beans and rice on the side and garnished it with fresh chopped scallions. This goes on my dinner list!

My family and I loved this dish. I used boneless skinless chicken thighes as that is what I had on hand. Per our own preferences I added more garlic to the rub/marinade and let it sit overnight. I added all coconut milk instead of any water (why waste the extra) and added about 1/2-3/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes (again per my families tastes). The chicken was tender and very flavorful. I will defititely be making this again.

Surprisingly delicious!!  I really loved the eclectic blend of ingredients which I, myself, did not have the cooking acumen to assemble. Yay Trinadad!!  I enjoyed with boneless breasts which shortened the cooking time.  I took liberties with all ingredients, operating on the more is more principle.  My husband, typically quite picky, enjoyed almost as much as I. Thanks for sharing.

Our daughter in Florida discovered it on this website and it has become a family favorite!  She added a few more ingredients to make the broth more flavorful.  Add two tsp. green curry paste, 1 cup organic chicken broth and a whole can of coconut milk.  It makes you want to keep eating until it's all gone.

Its a good recipe however i think 450 is a little high i think 350 is sufficient enough time.  Following the cook's recipe it came out a little dry and no sauce but i give it an over all 4 stars.

Made this last night and we loved it! I used thick cut boneless pork chops instead (because that's what I had in my fridge) and I served it over quinoa. I added more garlic and red pepper flakes than the recipe called for - we like it spicy! If you like this recipe then you should try this one also: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/moroccan-chicken-stew/detail.aspx

Added a fresh jalapeno (no seeds) and some lime juice to the marinade. Marinated 24 hours. Used 2T brown sugar (vs. 1/4 cup). Added 1 cup baby carrots during last 20 minutes. Very delicious and wonderfully tender. Will likely use same cooking technique over and over, using different seasonings. I do wish there was a bit more sauce. Next time will likely add some chx broth and/or coconut milk (will make it light coconut milk, next time!) to stretch it, as well as the jalapeno seeds (we'd like it even spicier!).

I would like to give this recipe 4.5 stars because it's original and it looks and smells great, but a tiny bit sweet and bland.  My husband said it smelled fantastic but only tasted pretty good.  I used bone-in chicken breasts (3), pureed the marinade ingredients, and added a tbsp of constarch/water at the end to thicken, but otherwise followed exactly.  I think next time I will about quadruple the chili flakes and make it spicy.  This recipe is not spicy as written.

Really tasty, everyone loved it. If I had to do it over again I'd use a pot with a larger base--I was using chicken hindquarters and had to brown them in two batches.

I thought this was faaaaaaaabulous! I used 2 boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut up into pieces. I did everything according to the directions, except I left out the butter. Unfortunately, hubby didn't like it because he doesn't like sweet food, so not sure how I'll get around to making this again.

I have always wanted to try stewed chicken, so I thought I would give this recipe a try. The only change I made was used boneless skinless chicken as that is what I had on hand. We loved it! We served it over jasmine rice like suggested and it was awesome. This dish has such a nice flavor.

Much better than I expected.  Was afraid that it would turn out too sweet because of the sugar.  Was pleasantly surprised to find that the end result wasn't sweet at all.  It was a stewed chicken with just enough of a difference to notice it.  Great alternative to your usual chicken recipe.

My husband made this fr dinner. It was delicious.  The taste had a tad bit of sweet, but not too much. It reminded me of sweet and sour chicken, but only slightly. It was very good and we'll have it again for sure.

This recipe was awesome, took me back to T&T!! This will be a regular.  I used 4lbs of bone-in thighs, skin removed.  I doubled the rub ingredients and finely pureed them as someone mentioned. Marinated overnight as others have suggested.  I also doubled the sauce recipe, using broth instead of the water and only half as much and at the end added some cornstarch in water to thicken it.   Served over rice.  Fantastic!!

This had a WONDERFUL flavor even though I was very skeptical of the ketchup. My only issue that is I was unable to get a photo of this recipe because although it looked fine after 30 minutes when I took it off the heat, it continued to cook afterwards until it charred into a gross looking black crust. (Which was tasty, actually, we chopped up the crusty black thing and ate it with our rice. But no picture, because it looked pretty vile.) I used the entire 30 minutes at medium heat to get my chicken breasts done -- they were pretty thick. In the future I would definitely use smaller pieces of chicken so I don't have to simmer this sauce so long! And possibly plate it right after it's done cooking so the sauce can't burn. Thanks for the recipe, it was definitely tasty!

LOVED this recipe. Easy to follow steps, but don't skip them as they make the dish. Intesely flavourful dish that satisfies any craving you could have. Sweet, garlicky, savory, coconutty. Mmmmm. I used homemade ham broth in place of water and fresh bird peppers instead of flakes. Scrumdiddlyumptious!

This is pretty easy to put together, and it's very tasty. It has a very unique flavor, and the way it cooks leaves it to almost have a BBQ glazed taste. The coconut milk is really great in this dish - I couldn't imagine leaving it out!

Very good stewed chicken. I used cubed boneless skinless chicken breast which turned out really well. The only little problem was when I added the chicken, which was still cold, the brown sugar syrup quickly hardened. I think next time I'll try adding a little water first to thin out the brown sugar so it doesn't solidify from the cold chicken. Other than that, it was perfect.

I made this for a Taste of the Tropics dinner party where each dish was from a different island.  Since it was the first time I made it, I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only thing I did different was follow the advice of the 2 Trinidadians that reviewed it and put the spices with some olive oil in the food processor and used it as a marinade.  I marinated overnight and then cooked it, cooled it, then reheated right before we ate.  By doing this, it picked up much more flavor and spice and was perfect.  I will make this again and again!

My husband used to order this meal weekly at a Trini restaurant in Chicago.  He said that it didn't taste the same, although he could taste "some" similarities.  I thought it was delicious, but never had it before so I didn't have anything to compare it to.  I also used a full can of coconut milk and more brown sugar than the recipe called for.

This was really good once you got past the funny mix of flavors in the first few bites. I did use the ketchup, and I think I'll leave that out next time, as well as not using the entire can of coconut milk. Still, very easy to make, and was wonderful over rice.

This recipe is AMAZING! I was a little apprehensive since my husband isn't big on coconut and I'm not big on sweet meat dishes, but after reading the reviews, we wanted to give it a shot. I am so glad I did! I used the whole can of coconut milk and 1/4 cup water, but that's the only change I made, and it was mind-blowing! I am so enthusiastic about this dish, I can't shut up about how good it was! Thanks for posting this recipe!!!

This is the first trinidadian recipe on this website that i really believe is better than my mom's! It was amazing! I've made it several times and everyone goes crazy for it. I use half a table spoon of caramel browning instead of brown sugar it gives more colour to the chicken and it cuts down on the excessive sweetness but other then that everything is perfect.

This is such a great recipe! When I got to the part where you add the ketchup, it already smelled so good that I didn't want to mess with it, but I did follow the recipe and added the ketchup, and it became even better!!!  This is one of the best recipes I have found in a long time!

We loved this recipe.  Several things happened during making this recipe.  The grocery was out of green onions so I only used white onions and I used dried celantro.  Plus I forgot to buy cocunut milk, so I used 2/3 c half and half and 1/3 cup milk.  I accidentally used too much oil in the beginning.  With all of these substitutions and changes it miraculously still turned out delicious.  My husband said he was glad I didn't use coc. milk.  Also, after the chicken was done cooking, I removed it from the sauce and put it on the plate.  Then I mixed white rice into what was left in the pan and served along side the chicken with a lovely pile of fresh cubed pineapple.  My husband and I were both members of the clean plate club with this meal!  Thanks for the post.

This recipe was great. It was simple and not that many ingredients. I added more coconut milk and substitued chicken broth for the water to add more flavor. My boyfriend loves gravy so I wanted to make more than the recipe called for.

This was fantastic. Spicy and sweet. I used a can of lite coconut milk and ommitted the water. Also added a cup of fresh broccoli a couple minutes before it was finished.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe!

This was terrific!  I used skinless chicken thighs and the whole family loved it.  The sauce begs to be soaked up in something so I served it with rice.

Excellent dish, family loved. I followed the others by adding the entire can of coconut milk and 1/2 the water. I also used chunks of breast meat instead of a whole chicken. Only problem I had was that the sugary mixture didn't really turn syrupy and the chicken didn't brown. But the flavor was great! Will definitely make again.

This was an excellent dish.  The spices and coconut milk gave it a great flavor.  The chicken was moist and the spices gave it just the right burn.

This was delicious, my husband and I both loved it.  It was easy to make.  I added carrots at the same time as the water and coconut milk and they were great too.

So much better that I had expected. Excellent. I used Ghee as I have a ready supply on hand.  And I added a bag 454g of Spinach so I could get a few more vitamins.

I would have never thought to add sugar in with the oil, but it gave it a nice extra taste.  I will make this again and make it a little spicy

I changed the coconut milk for dark rum and chicken broth. Nixed the onions, too. Added a teaspoon of Gravy Master to chicken mixture. A nice brown gravy came forth! It was truly yummy!!

Came out really good with some adjustments. 
Used thighs and drumsticks only. Trimmed most of the skin to avoid sauce being too greasy. 
Cut the brown sugar in half, doubled the onion, added two diced Roma tomatoes to the saute. Used chicken broth in place of water. Used coconut milk high in fat (Aroy-D 70% coconut extract delicious).
A little corn starch slurry at the end thickened the gravy.
Cilantro, green onions, and Serrano peppers to garnish.
Big hit!

I had some leftover roasted chicken so I used that. Eliminated the sugar and used diced tomatoes instead of ketchup.  Used fresh garlic and added some Bangkok spice which I had on hand. Also used the other half can of coconut milk to make rice to go with it. Delicious!

Great dish. Make sure to get the sugar syrup very hot before adding the chicken. I added the chicken as soon as the brown sugar melted. It wasn’t hot enough so the sugar froze on the spoon and didn’t brown the chicken.

I loved it! ... However, I marinated the chicken over night and cooked it in the oven before I started step two.... Like many of the other comments, I also used a whole can of coconut milk instead of 1/2... It came out great! will make again, super easy.

This was simply delicious.  I marinated it with a thinly sliced habañero pepper instead of using crushed red pepper.  I added a few dashes of soy sauce.  I also added chopped carrot, celery, peas, and a bit more diced onion.  It was fabulous over rice.

I give this 5 stars because my kids ages 7, 5, &4 all cleaned their plates! I made this dish as written except that I didn't marinate the chicken ahead of time. Just put the seasonings in together when I started browning the chicken. Also I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. Delicious!

Good recipe. Not too hot. I scraped seeds out of home grown hot pepper. Nice flavor. One thing I did different was to partially prepare as recipe directed. Then finished cooking in slow cooker on low for 4 hrs.

What a wonderful recipe but thanks to MYRTS78 suggestion it turned out great. I was worried because this was my second time(the first time was terrible) I made this but this time I decide as MYRTs78 suggested to first of blend all the ingredients to marinate the meat overnight and I didn't use coconut milk. Since I didn't have chicken broth I used a package of chicken gravy and put in more crushed red peppers. As the liquor was boiling down I did sprinkle a little more brown sugar for sweet/spicy/hot taste.DELICIOUS!  Thanks!

Very tasty. The red pepper flakes and coconut milk were optional. I used them and recommend their addition highly. I did make one substitution. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, because I had them on hand. I think if I had used the whole cut up chicken, with skin on, thi

I made this recipe using extra onions, garlic and a little thyme topping it 28th dumplings served over rice. I substitutes chicken stock for water, eliminated the butter and added the red pepper flakes and a little corn starch for thickener...very tasty!

Absolutely delicious!!!  I marinated overnight.  I also omitted the coconut milk, added about 2 oz. of onion and chive cream cheese spread for the milky creaminess.  Chicken tender and flavorful!  Will definitely make again!  Thank you!!

OMG, amazing ??? I used boneless chicken thighs & breasrs, omitted the coconut milk (because I didn't have any) & ketchup ( use tomato paste)  & set it in the crock pot on low for 6 hours. My VERY picky 6 year old was looking for a third serving. Next time I'll triple the recipe. Thanks!

Technically I'm giving my 5 stars to myrts78 also since I followed her advice to brown longer and add some soy sauce. This was a family hit.  I served it with a recipe I found for Doubles and some jasmine rice.

So tasty. Served to large male group and they kept returning for seconds. Went well with coconut cilantro rice where a bit of coconut cream was added. Careful if substituting coconut cream for coco milk as a tsp at a time may do. Rarely do I comment if at all but this recipe was excellent. Next time Ill try chicken thighs.

It is good. I made some changes to the recipe, used bbq sauce and meadow lea instead of ketchup and butter. I used sugar as it is mentioned in the recipe n found the dish little more on the sweet side. May be next time i will be using less sugar. Served with penne pasta.

My husband was leery at first, we've tried recipes that were/are very simliar and have not hadd good results.  However this wonderful!  Not only did he clean his plate, he went back for seconds.  The only difference I did was to use parsley instead of cilantro (neither of us can stand cilantro) and diced regular sweet onions and a little bit of a scallion.

I followed the recipe on this to a tee and it was quite tasty. One thing I couldn't figure out neither from the original recipe nor the other reviewers was whether or not to include the marinade in the finished dish. Some recipes say to discard the marinade and other recipes say to use it. This one didn't say so I included it and it worked out fine.

I make this with sliced boneless chicken breasts and reduce the cook time a bit. For me the coconut milk is a must! I prefer to serve this over quinoa. A coworker of mine liked this so much that she kept stealing bites of it out of my lunch!

This wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting based on the reviews, but it's pretty good overall.  I used boneless/skinless thighs, and took other suggestions to use the blender on the chicken marinade -- it was probably easier than chopping everything finely anyway.  I pretty much doubled the ingredients for the marinade, and let them sit overnight.  The brown sugar did get hard after I added the chicken, but as things heated up and got stirred around the chunks went away. I used the whole can of coconut milk and no water, and served with couscous.  Next time I think I'd add more red pepper flakes since I couldn't really taste them.

Very forgiving recipe as I made several mistakes/variations and it still turned out good enough that my kids (12 and 8) asked to have it again. My first mistake was cooking the syrup either too long or having the heat too high, as when I added the chicken, the syrup turned hard.  I tried to break it up with a spoon and ended up sprinkling more sugar on the chicken as it browned.  Second, I only "browned" it until it was no longer pink and should have browned it longer, I think.  Other variations included making a paste with olive oil out of the marinade ingredients and marinating it for several hours, as suggested by other reviewers, and I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into 2-inch chunks.

This recipe is absolutly delish. My fiance whose father is from Trinidad loves this dish. He said "this is better than his parents" I was very nervous making this but it turned out incrediable. I did make one change instead of using water, I used chicken broth. Thanks for posting this!

Tried this today and it was a hit with me and my fam!  We're not Trinidadian so it was just "something different" for us.  I served it over coconut rice with a side salad.  Will make again.  It came together easily and didn't take very long.

Very good and so tasty!
I liked a lot, my wife also, and even the kids! Which is more rare! When they know that I try a new recipe, their first minding is to hate that, and see after! But this time, they liked. Perfect!

Enjoyed this very much and it is very yummy indeed! Used bone-in thighs instead and garlic and onion powder instead of fresh and used the coconut milk and red pepper flakes. Skipped the butter, didn't think it needed. Overall a tad too sweet but it's my personal preference. Definitely something I would make again!

This was really good.  I made it the 1st time for a Memorial Day get together.  I doubled the recipe and used 2 whole chickens cut into pieces.  I added 1 whole can of coconut milk and 1 cup of water.  I marinated the chicken pieces over night.  I used more brown sugar and browned the pieces longer as recommended in another review, and cooked them longer since I was cooking 2 chickens.  The meat was so tender, and was falling off the bone!  I will definitely make this again but increase the amount of garlic and red pepper next time.  Got great feedback from my guests!

This was very good. My family loved it. I am going to try it a little spicier and in my crock pot. I think that it will make the chicken more tender and let the flavors meld more. There were no leftovers. Thank you for the recipe.

This was not a big hit. I gave it 3 stars instead of two b/c I did add more coconut milk than called for, so maybe that was a big part of the problem. It definitely tasted better than it smelled, but it was just ok. Oh, and when I added the chicken to the brown sugar syrup the syrup crystallized instantly. It did liquify once the everything got hot again. This was my first try at Caribbean food and maybe it's not for everyone. So for anyone who has never had this type of food, you should really try a very small batch before you make a whole chicken that may not be to your liking. Just a thought.

This had great flavor but it was overwhelmed by sweetness. The brown sugar and the coconut milk blew out all the other great flavors in the marinade. Next time I'll either cut way down on the sugar or just cut out the coconut milk altogether. Still it was pretty good served over yellow jasmine rice.

I did not have green onions, cilantro, minced garlic or coconut milk.  I followed everything else, came out great. I never cook, but, thanks to this site, i am starting to learn.  Will get the ingredients for next time :-)

Wow! This was a very delicious dish! I followed the recipe exactly. The caramelizing the brown sugar was tricky for me, but that's because I'm relatively new to cooking. This is really fun to make and I am definitely going to do it again! I can impress my parents with this one when I come home from college. :)

Excellent recipe! The only thing I did different was marinate the chicken for a couple of hours rather than 30min. Also I used chicken broth instead of water. But otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Definitely add the coconut milk and red pepper, it makes the dish.

i can't vouch if this tastes "authentic" because i don't know what it's supposed to taste like. but it's delicious. none of the flavors are overpowering. they work well together. plus, i am trying to stretch my meals...i didn't have quite enough chicken so when i added the coconut milk, i also threw in a cup of diced potatoes and thankfully it worked out fine.

I served this for visiting Trinis and they loved it (as did I).  I used chicken stock - no coconut milk as this is not correct for this recipe (as mentioned by other reviewers).  I also used boneless chicken which works nicely.

Fantastic.  My husband and I both loved it.  I made it with about 4x the amount of cilantro, garlic, onion and green onion, and I also added halved bella mushrooms, and served it over japanese (california) rice.  It was delish, and very easy.

this made a delicious gravy. i used bone in thighs. the sauce was a little greasy so i might suggest removing the skin. i didnt use the optional coconut milk so i threw in some orange zest to make up for the lack of flavor. the cilantro did not come through for me as much as i expected so i added some freshly chopped as a garnish and i was pleased.the gravy was wonderful over the brazilian white rice from this site.

Not only was this recipe unique, but it was delicious.  I was not sure what to expect, but I followed the recipe exactly, and the outcome was fantastic.  What a great use for cilantro.  Excellent recipe--no need for any significant changes.

I was skeptical but it worked! For those who say your gravy was not thick enough, cut potatoes into small potatoes & add into the wok with rest of stew. As the potatoes boil, the gravy becomes thicker. I also added ginger. Mine was rather sweet so I added lots of salt as I'm pregnant & cant do spicy all the time. I added more ketchup, about 4 tablespoons & I skipped the coconut as I do not like the taste. Would recommend to anyone. Only marinaded for one and a half hours and it still tasted good! Try it!

Awsome dish!  My son came in while I was making this dish and said it didn't look that great.  He ate seconds!

The whole family loved it, and this dish will be in heavy rotation!

This had a good flavor. Make sure you double the recipe to have some extra sauce. The next time I am going to leave the skin on the chicken to see if the chicken is able to absorb the sauce better.

I made this last night and WOW!  My picky boyfriend LOVED it even though neither of us is particularly crazy about coconut.  That said, I pretty much followed the recipe to a T.  The only alterations I made was I used 1 pound of boneless chicken breasts, a little less coconut milk, added several more tablespoons of ketchup, and added crushed pineapple bits to the dish at the very end. I found a can of it in my pantry and thought....mmmmmm....coconut and pineapple.  Those 2 things go together right?   AMAZING!  It added just enough sweetness to the spiciness of the dish.  I will definitely make this again.

Decent recipe. No one else in my family cared for it. I liked it better the next day because the chicken had more flavor. And it was a bit more spicy. Oh, and I didn't add ketchup.

So simple but so good! The coconut milk is a definite plus, makes the house smell like chinese food. Make a bit extra sauce, especially if serving over rice.

I made this yesterday & I must say WOW!  I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours instead of 30 minutes.  

I omitted the green onion because I forgot to buy it.  I increased the amount of regular onion & garlic.  And just because I love garlic so much I replaced half the salt with garlic salt. 

My only other change was to use a whole can of coconut milk in place of water.  

I can honestly say this is probably one of the best things I have EVER made.

I think, no I know I could eat this every night. Made exactly as stated and this was  a nice balance of sweet and spicy. Made this with coconut rice to use up the left over coconut, I think this would go better with peas and rice. Yummy.

Wow.  This was really tasty.  Being from New Orleans, I like it HOT, so I used more red pepper.  Also added some Jerk seasoning paste to the marinating rub, and marinated the chicken (I used 4 lbs of bone-in thighs) for several hours.  What a great recipe!  Thanks.

We don't add ketchup or butter, we use soy & sometimes Worcershire & use sweet onion sliced thin(all added in the beginning for marinade & cooking w/the lime cleaned chicken) For a true Trinidad flavor,I think, cilantro should be used(instead of parsley), but if you can find it chado beni (also known/pronounced bhandania) is like a "stronger" tasting/smelling herb.

I didn't have cilantro, but this is the kind of recipe that I will have to use again! I thought the chicken was quite good, but it was even better the next day wrapped in a tortilla! Yumm :)

Very good. I added the whole can of coconut milk and no water; everything else I did per the recipe. I thought the level of sweetness was just right and my husband loved it. It was especially tasty over white rice with black beans on the side.  Thanks!

We thought this dish was just too sweet, though that might be because I added the whole can (about 1 cup) of coconut milk as other reviewers suggested. The marinated chicken (with garlic, onion, cilantro, salt/pepper, etc.) smelled heavenly and made me look forward to the end result, but I lost interest after adding the brown sugar and the coconut milk. If anyone else is concerned about the sweetness, I'd recommend cutting out the brown sugar or really using only the 1/2 cup of coconut milk as suggested in the recipe.
**This was much better the next day as leftovers!**

We really enjoyed this dish. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into cubes), lightly seasoning them with onion powder & garlic powder; used much less salt (maybe just 1/8tsp sprinkled over the chicken).  Substituted the water with chicken broth. I used half the amount of chicken called for, but all of the gravy.  Served this over steamed basmati rice and all but a smidge was left when dinner was over!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Masonbrowne!

Mad good!!!!!!!!!!!  My mom and DH said 4 stars- my mom would have liked more crunch (suggested water chestnuts) and DH wanted less sweet.  I agree with both a little bit.  Altogether, this was VERY easy to make and good to eat.   I made this with basmati rice which I cooked in the microwave and then dumped right into the pan with all the chicken and sauce.  For the whole recipe I used 1 whole can of coconut milk and about 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I used 2 Tbsp of cornstarch and a little bit of water to thicken the sauce.  YUM!!!!!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

It wasn't horrible, but no one liked it much.  I won't make it again.  I guess we just aren't used to coconut milk.

YUMMMMM...I loved this dish. I don't like cilantro so I used parsley, and like others I used a whole can of coconut milk and omitted the water. Even my very picky husband loved this dish!!

This recipe was definetly a hit with my fiance.  He is African and loves gravy.  I blended some green onion, little oil, garlic, and cilantro and .sodium free chicken boullion....coated the chicken with it and let it marinate for 30 minutes.  I also used just about a whole can of coconut milk instead of water, and I didnt have to thicken the gravy.  It was already a good consistency for us!!!!!

This has quickly become one of my favorites.  I also used the whole can of coconut milk for extra sauce and breast tenders instead of bone-in chicken.  Absolutely wonderful!

....----~~~~Loved it!~~~~----....
I used the whole can of coconut milk as well, and I added 2 Tbls. of smooth peanut butter to finish off the sauce. If the whole can of coconut milk is used, it makes enough sauce to slather on left over rice for lunch the next day! Yum~~ Ü
