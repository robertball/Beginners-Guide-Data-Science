This is the recipe I have been searching for - the one with butter and lots of pumpkin - thank you so much Crystal!!

One tip - I used a large disher (scoop) and put them on the tray, then I slammed the tray down on the table a couple of times and it flattened them out perfectly.  I got that tip from another baker and it's a great one! You want perfect Chocolate Chip Pumpkin cookies, this is the recipe!

Nice flavor.  The whole family liked them.  I did use a combination of whole wheat and white flour and no one noticed.  I only made a half batch as I didn't want to waste chocolate chips if we didn't like the cookies. Next time I'll make the full batch or even a double batch!

Nice cookie for a change of pace.  I just added a few shakes of cinnamon in place of the pie spice mix.  The dough is soft so dont be worried.  Yummy!!  :)

This was EXACTLY the recipe I wanted! Cake-like, sweet without being over sweet. Love it. I'm saving this one.

(I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp cloves, 1/8 tsp allspice, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also substituted brown for white sugar.)

This recipe is great as written! Like another user mentioned. Uses butter and lots of pumpkin. (Almost double the amount most recipes call for) I made some changes to make it healthier and suit my own tastes. I used 2 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/2 cup low fat buttermilk, 1/2 cup BROWN sugar, 5 packets of Splenda, 2 tbs flax+1/2  cup water pureed till smooth (substitutes the eggs), 2 cups of pumpkin, 1 TBS vanilla, and 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips. I decided to use melted butter to blend in the brown sugar better.  The full cup of butter is really not necessary but definitely needed for the wonderful flavor of butter. The buttermilk that substituted for the other 1/2 cup of butter provided the rich flavor that apple sauce/ yogurt won't provide. I didn't use the walnuts but I'm sure they would be delicious. Perhaps even better with toasted pecans.  Drop them by rounded tbs on the cookie sheet and flattened them out slightly because they don't spread much. I baked mine at 375 degrees for 19 minutes. They may look done earlier but they are not! The large amount of pumpkin takes a while to cook through. After baking, the result is a crisp outside and soft inside cake-like cookie. Amazing rich buttery pumpkin flavor cookie. My house smelled just like Thanksgiving time when I was baking. Definitely try it this way. Hopefully my review helped. =D

These cookies are fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly but I did add some red food coloring for a more orange cookie. I took them to work and to some friends and there was not a crumb left! They are all asking for a repeat.
For the reviewers who complained about them being "cake like", that is how they are supposed to be. Great recipe, thanks!

9 minutes is more than enough i burned fit batch @ 14 minutes So definetly check on them often. I added a cup of oatmeal almost added another cup of Corn Flakes but wasnt sure if they are nut free it would have been a nice add in though.

A very yummy recipe! I left out the walnuts because my husband dislikes them. I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice, so I substituted with 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon of ginger. Tastes just fine to me!

My friend and I just made these cookies and, not that they were not tasty, but they definitely had a strong flour taste to them.  We are not sure if this is just because there is too much flour in the cookies themselves or if there is not enough of another ingredient to combat the strong flour taste.  So, yummy cookies, but something could be done about the strong flour taste.

These are really good; the whole family loved them. I thought I'd try cream cheese frosting on them but they were MUCH better left alone!!! I followed the suggestions of pounding the baking sheet on the counter to flatten them a bit 1st and then baked mine for 16 min. @ 350. They turned out soft, moist and delicious!

I have made this recipe 3 times so far. One batch my husband gobbled up in no time flat, and the others I brought to Thanksgiving dinner. They are VERY moist! They have a cake like texture, very springy. The next day they are even more moist! They get a little sticky. I wasn't sure I was a fan at first, it's a different texture for a cookie, I thought maybe I did something wrong (hence making them 3 times!) but now i'm sold. I do like cake, lol. Thanks!

Great recipe for an interesting cookie!  I wasn't expecting the cake-like consistency but it works.  I made them last week and I'm making them again tomorrow without any changes.

Thank You for this recipe. When I bake I am not a fan of using shortening. I have been looking for a recipe similar to how I make my chocolate chip cookies and this one was perfect! Will definately make these again.

These weren't all that great.  They came out more like cake, as another member said...not a good texture and the taste wasn't that great.  I love pumpkin, but I won't be making this recipe again.

These were delicious.  I halved the butter just to make it a little healthier, and the results were fine.  My husband and all three kids loved these.  Everyone ate until I told them no more...

very good, but I added more flour to total about 3 cups in order to make them a little more chewy like a regular chocolate chip cookie, and less cake-like. They're still not totally like regular cookies, but they're closer. Great idea, they taste great.

I did not care for these.  I was hopeful that they would be less "cake-like" as all pumpkin cookie recipes are (due to the picture and the all-butter recipe), but they were quite cake-like after all.  they weren't quite pumpkin spice enough for my tastes either.

These were pretty good especially when dipped in milk.  Added a little bit of brown sugar and cinnamon maybe next time I'll add a little bit of butter milk.  They seemed like something was missing.

These were great! The only thing I would want people to know is they are soooooo much better the next day. They'd be a wonderful change from the norm for Christmas cookies. They'll be at my family get together this year:)

Not good!  No flavor at all.  I adjusted the recipe with more cinnamon, pumpkin spice, and allspice after the first dozen came out bland.  They could not be saved.  Do not bother with these cookies!

These are great!! I needed a recipe that I could use my freshly pureed pumpkin and this fit the bill!! I just used cinnamon because I didn't want go through the added steps of making pumpkin spice and they turned out great. I prefer to use the mini chips. Will make again!

These are awsome cookies!! My family adores them and I make them every fall. However for those people that are cinnamon lovers like my daughter and me, I sustitute cinnamon chips instead of chocolate chips. Wow! We love, love, love them. My daughter is coming home from collage for her first break tomorrow and i'm making a double batch. One for now, one for her to take back and share with her friends. Thank you for a great recipe!

I made these cookies exactly as the recipe called for, except I was force to use half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of regular sugar-only because I ran out of sugar. The only problem was that the next day they were a little soggy. Not sure if anyone else had this problem. Although I didn't do it this time, I would suggest adding raisins..I'll definitely do that next time I make these cookies.

I made some today, but something was missing, they tasted flat. Then I realized there isnt any salt. No offense, but when I make them again, if I do I plan to add salt.
Sorry,and I dont know if that will make the difference.

Made these cookies last night and my family didn't really like them. They were kind of weird tasting. But that's just us. A couple of my co-workers really like them, though.

This is a good recipe and the cookies were good.  I used Splenda instead of sugar due sugar restrictions and the cookies didn't spread out.  They stayed in the drop shapes they were put in.  Otherwise, they were good.  My daughter loved them!

I followed the recipe exactly. My family and I were a bit disappointed because the texture of these cookies are more like pumpkin bread, not a cookie. We are not soft-cookie fans and these are definitely a soft-cookie. The flavor is pretty good, but not great. Sorry to be a downer on this recipe... We really wanted to love it.

I was wanting a recipe with butter and not oil because oil ones are so greasy. This recipe is fantastic. I added a 1/4 tsp of salt to bring out the sweetness more in the cookie without adding more sugar. My can of pumpkin was only 15oz, so I added a little extra vanilla for moisture.

18 minutes at 375 degrees is a good way to burn these cookies. My first batch was burned on the bottom. Surprisingly, these cookies are a little bland. I probably won't make them again.

Made these exactly as written besides using homemade pumpkin purée. The cookies were delicious and moist, I love that they don't have a lot of sugar. My 3 year old stole 5 of these cookies!

Delicious cookies. Cake like texture makes them even more unique. Easy to make and comes out perfect everytime. One bag of semi sweet chocolates are enough to get chocolate in every bite! Sweet enough but not overly sugary and make them big or small. Perfect for the fall season. Everybody absolutley loves them! Thank u!

Great recipe! I tweaked the recipe for high altitude by using 1 tbsp less butter and adding 2 tbsp extra flour. I added a little cinnamon and used milk chocolate and butterscotch chips! I baked them for 15 minutes based on other comments, they were perfect!

the whole fam loved this cookie, I swapped 1/4th cup sugar for brown sugar doubled the recipe, turned down the oven to 350 and cooked them for 20 min, my guy didn't like the dark edges from the 375 for 18 min I wanted something with extra pumpkin and found a winner, he has eaten through the first batch. I didn't mean to add my pic to this recipe lol thought it was for the comment I was making.

Yum!  I was a little concerned because the dough was pretty soft, but they turned out great!  They are definitely cake-like cookies.  And keep an eye on the time, mine only took 12-14 mins.

I've been making these cookies in the fall for a few years now, and my friends know and ask me for them!  I follow the recipe exactly. They're easy, fast, and yummy!
