This recipe is a must try! I absolutely could not believe how easy this was to make! I decided to try it, as a fast and easy desert. I followed the recipe to the detail to see what the untampered cake would taste like.  Perfection! My next batch, I will add a few chocolate chips to the mix, powdered sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream to the finished product.

I love the concept, and the ingredients are great. However, the taste was terribly bitter. It needs much more sweetener than the recipe calls for.

I'll make it again with adjustments. I should have noticed the proportion of cocoa powder to sweetener when I made it. That one change will make this mug cake so much better, maybe a four or five star recipe.
