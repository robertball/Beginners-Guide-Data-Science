You don't have to be a kid to love this pizza!  I made individual pizzas with pita rounds for crusts and tried several varieties. My husband and I both preferred ground beef over the ground pork. I liked mozzarella instead of the Colby Jack cheese; hubby liked cheddar. The crushed tortilla chips got dry and hard when baked on top of the pizza but we solved that by sprinkling the chips directly on the salsa, under the meat and cheese. (You can also  wait and add the chips after baking, along with the lettuce and olives, but if you omit them altogether you miss an important piece of the whole taco-taste package.) We also tried adding some refried beans and they were delicious! One of the great things about using the pita bread for crust is that it is so easy to try different toppings and to make everybody happy. For instance, I love hot-hot-hot salsa and lots of olives but my husband likes medium-mild salsa and no olives. With these pizzas, we both got what we wanted!

This pizza is surprisingly good for such minimal effort.  I had a Pillsbury pizza crust in the fridge that needed to be used so I used that after partially baking it. Thought that pork was an odd choice for a taco pizza but goodness, the recipe was posted by the National Pork Board!  I did use the pork and a chipotle flavor taco seasoning mix and the flavor was awesome!  Based on the reviews, I put my tortilla chips under the cheese and they were perfect. Added chopped fresh roma tomatoes on top before baking.  I also sprinkled some sliced green onions on top with the lettuce and olives.  Everyone loved it...my hubby just devoured it, even loaded with the lettuce!

This pizza tasted great, but I guess baking the crushed tortilla chips on top made them harder than normal.  We had to pick them off to eat the pizza, because the sharp edges of the chips hurt our mouths too much.

I'll make this again, but without the crushed tortilla chips.

My family really liked this, I didn't change a thing, but did use Doritos. I wanted to add Sour Cream but I was out, so I used a drizzle of ranch which I think made it great. Also, I think you could use ground beef or ground turkey quite well, ground pork was great to.  We had recently tried some professional pizza chains taco pizzas and this pizza in it's simplicity was better than those pizzas.

We thought this was great! Followed the directions exactly. I think the only thing I would change is to add the tortilla pieces after removing the pizza from the oven because they browned a bit more than we would like. Everything else was perfect.

I did change it a little ... I used a pre-baked thin pizza crust so that made it really easy!  I put down a mild La Victoria salsa for the pizza sauce. I used a pound of ground beef with a bit of onion and taco seasoning packet for the meat. I crunched up tostitos corn chips to go on top of that layer. I used a weight watchers mexican cheese mix for the next layer (even though I never like using lowfat ANYTHING!) and added the sliced black olives on top of that.  After baking, and as I served it - I topped it with shredded lettuce, and diced red pepper and avacado. (I was out of tomato, and the red pepper added great color and FLAVOR!) My entire family LOVED it!

I made this using a prepared pizza crust and ground beef instead of the pork. In addition to the lettuce, I topped it with chopped tomatoes and sour cream. Was great.

Used diced chicken and low-fat sharp cheddar cheese, and added baked Doritos the last 5 minutes. Tasted great.

I used a 12" thin & crispy pizza crust. I used 1 lb of beef with a package of taco seasoning. I added 1/4 of an onion and used a whole small can of black olives. I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of monterey, and we topped the pizza with lots of yummy sour cream.
