I chose this recipe because of the veggie combination and it did NOT disappoint on that front! Who knew butternut squash & beets could co-exist in such deliciousness? I altered the recipe to make it crock pot compatible by only using 1 qt. of chicken stock and I subbed Trader Joe's Jalapeno Chicken Sausage for the elk. I also used apple cider vinegar and ginger paste. I got a little too liberal with the hot sauce and my preschooler refused to eat it. Cooked on high for 4 hours and then turned it on low for 3 and it was fantastic. I used a few more veggies (whole head of cabbage, 3 beets, 3-4c. squash) because I was trying to unload a bunch of veggies. I also skipped the cream of mushroom soup because I didn't have any on hand (but i did add some leftover cream of tomato soup towards the end). I thought it was very tasty, stick-to-the-ribs fair but with the hot sauce and the jalapeno chicken sausage, too spicy for little ones (although *I* loved it!)

We don't get elk very often but this was a special and wonderful winter soup.

The flavor WAS really good. I needed to use up alll the veggies that I had in the fridge so I made some substitutions; didn’t have potatos so I used cauliflower and added mushrooms and substituted red for white wine  vinaiger. Everything else was the same and everyone loved even my toddler and baby... I’d make this again

So this is a good recipe! I tried it vegetarian style and it was yummy.  The squash actually made the mix a bit sweet which was a great addition to this. (I have tried similar recipes in the past). Next time we will buy the meat in advance and I'm sure then, it would be a perfect hearty meal!

I couldn't get elk,  so subbed chicken breakfast sausage.  Didn't add potatoes or squash to cut down on carbs a bit.  

To my taste the sage was overpowering,  even with the other spices and vinegar and hot sauce.  I ended up adding onion powder and extra dill to balance the flavors a bit.  

I also found that my cream of mushroom soup curdled (maybe from the vinegar? ) though it didn't keep us from eating it. Maybe I did something wrong when adding it.
