Where I live (Slovenia, and all over in the Balkans) this is called burek.  It's usually rolled or can be baked in a round pan like a pie.  This recipe is a different take on the burek I know (which can be with cheese, meat, potato, spinach).  This is a great meal, especially if you have plain drinking yogurt with it.  Yum!

Amazing, although I'd prefer it with the Feta/Spinach blend. Many Armenians also eat it with plain Spinach, Ground Beef, and in my family:Cream Cheese. It's excellent, although when using the Cream Cheese, you have to add some flour to it to make it more firm, or else the cream cheese becomes too liquidy while baking.

I found these to be an excellent blend of cheeses, and the timings were spot on.  I used them as appetisers with a variety of dips, although I can imagine it would be great as part of a light lunch as well!

We tried this recipe for a Christmas Eve gathering. It was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. They are a bit of work and it takes practice to get the shape right, but it is worth it. There were no leftovers!

After visiting the ancient city of Constantinople, known today as Istanbul, Turkey, I learned to make the original Feta Cheese Borek in a pan from my Turkish-American husband.  I used fresh Feta Cheese, instead of the ones in this recipe for the authentic flavor of the Cheese Borek.

not a fan of the variation, call me a purist but it's better with feta. Also, way too much parsley. The version in the picture is like the caserole version, layered like a lasagna, two sheets filo, brush with butter, and it makes the layers a bit better if you put the melted butter and also a bit of egg beaten with milk. there are many ways to do borek such as triangles, layered, rolled up into a spiral like a cinamon roll almost, rolled like cigar (sigara borek). etc.

Hi, I haven't tried this recipe but when I make borek I use yufka sheets (Turkish) instead of phyllo dough. Layer them in a large baking pan, each layer getting its own coating of the butter, and after layering about half the dough I put the cheese on it and keep layering it till all the dough is used.  I bake the borek in the pan and cut before serving.  It isn't time consuming to prepare this way.  In fact, it becomes one of those dishes you can prepare quickly if need be.
