Absolutely Divine!!!  This is the easiest most forgiving recipe for scallops I have found!  Our family loves, loves, loves these....  Simple, quick and convenient for a weeknight supper as for the company table.  A note of caution for those that don't normally cook scallops:  Do not over marinate as they will turn rubbery.  Try this, I GUARANTEE you will not be disappointed!!!!

I make these every so often to ensure I don't get tired of them and they're awesome. I don't use the mustard because I've never liked it, and I think they turn out really well without it. My only advice would be not to over-marinade the scallops; 20 minutes would be fine. Otherwise they have a strange texture. Thank you for your recipe!

I did not think this would end up good but it was!!!! I would say that you have to decide how sweat you want it and choose marinade time. Overnight gets very sweat and overly hides the seafood taste. 3 hours gets it about in the middle and still able to tast the scallops

This is an awesome recipe, but I would not recommend marinating the scallops as long as written - there is a high chance they'll go rubbery on you. I marinated mine for about 15 minutes and they were perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is excellent! I make this all the time for dinner parties and everyone loves them. When ever I tell people the scallops are marinated, they're like "is that why they taste so good?". My husband eats these like they're going out of style which is why I have to make a ton!

Wow, what an excellent recipe!  Plus, it was unbelievably easy.  I substituted turkey bacon and sugar free maple syrup to keep it light and was thrilled with the results.  I used the frozen scallops from Publix.  They're great to have in handy in the freezer for a quick easy meal.

These were so tasty!  They were sweet and savory and we served them nice and hot.  They are almost a melt in your mouth texture.  Everyone kept asking if there were more long after they had all been eaten.  Use a good quality thick cut bacon for the best results.  Though any bacon will still work.  These will be a huge hit with anyone who like bacon or scallops.  You have got to try these!

These scallops were super.  I marinated them overnight and used frozen medium sized scallops.  Great party appetizer.

while the marinade was fantastic, the scallops were not a hit at my recent dinner party.  not too difficult to make at all,when following the time to a "T" the scallops did not come out chewy!  would be a great recipe to add for those who love to try new food, or love all varieties of seafood.  not a great choice with finicky, choosy, or nervous eaters.

These are very good and easy to make.  I thought they might be too sweet but they weren't, they were perfectly flavored.

This was an interesting change for us.  We’ve enjoyed bacon-wrapped scallops often, but never like this, with the additions of maple syrup, Dijon and brown sugar.  Even after omitting the brown sugar we still found this a little too sweet for our tastes.  Scallops are already rich and sweet, but I did like the slight maple flavor, so if I was to try this again I’d omit the sugar and cut back a little on the maple syrup too.  Also, I marinated the scallops for a mere half hour and that was plenty. I served this with "Almond Wild Rice" and "Spring Asparagus Salad," both recipes also from this site.

Excellent recipe.  I have made it twice now and follow the marinade instructions exactly( well almost exactly cause who measures when your mixing up marinade).  The only change I made was to add finely chopped pecans to brown sugar sprinkled on top.  As my lady tells me.  Everything goes better with nuts.  They were delicious.  Served them one time as an appetizer and another as a main course with buttered parslied Yukon Gold potatoes.  The only trick is to cook the bacon long enough so that it will crisp in the oven but not so long as to make it impossible to roll around the scallops.  Thanks

I made these twice this week, one run-thru to make sure they were good and then I made them a second time to serve to my boyfriend.  Obviously I reduced the servings (I calculated for 4 servings) and I made them the first time exactly by the recipe, but the second time I left off the sprinkling of brown sugar, thinking it didn't really add much.  I can attest that they are better WITH the brown sugar.  Instead of prepping the bacon in the oven I cooked it in the microwave for 90 seconds to render off some of the fat (don't skip this step) and I even put the finished scallops into the microwave for 20 seconds to crisp the bacon a bit more, and it was successful.  It was a very simple, tasty recipe exactly as-is.  I will definitely make this again and make it in larger quantities.

Loved it!  I used the ready-made bacon so I wouldn't have to worry about the scallops overcooking while waiting for the bacon to crisp up.  It worked well.  We don't have scallops very often, but will definitely use this recipe again when we do.

This recipe is getting filed under "do again and often." It's the perfect blend of sweet and savory, with a wonderful texture. We marinated about 15-20 minutes. We couldn't find large scallops, so we used medium and left them whole. Amazing!

These were so freaking good I'd give them 10 stars if I could.  I used dry pack scallops from Sendiks (don't know if that made a huge dif from pre-frozen ones) and thick, center cut bacon from Aldi.  Used real maple syrup and let them marinate for about 5 hours.  They were to die for.  I'm going to try to make them with smaller scallops and a small piece of bacon like a small kabob and see how they are since they are so good yet the scallops can be so expensive.  Make sure you cook the bacon for a little while before adding them to the scallop so everything is cooked thru.  I cooked mine in the oven for about 10 minutes or so.  The combo of the sweet and the salty was outstanding.

Just over the top delicious. Super easy to make. I did cook the bacon a wee bit and let it cool before wrapping the scallops. The bacon was done very nicely and truly complemented the scallop. I can't wait to do this dish again!

These were a nice change, but a little too sweet for us even after adding a little smoked chipotle powder and a little cayenne.  I may try them again  using less maple syrup.

I've never rated a recipe before, although I've tried dozens, but I had to share this.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  My husband, who has traveled extensively as a design engineer, said "I've eaten in restaurants all around the world and I've never had anything better than this, ever."  Guess that says it all.

Mmmm these were sooo good!  Followed the recipe exactly except only marinated the scallops for 15 minutes.  FYI 12 large scallops = 1 lb.  Also, I forgot the foil on the baking sheet - made for a messy clean up, but everything still tasted great!  Don't leave out the brown sugar!  We actually had these for dinner and served them over arugula... when the scallops were gone, we ate the arugula as a salad!  They'd also make a great party appetizer - our friends go crazy for these at weddings and now we can make them at home!

I just finished making these delicious scallops for Superbowl today and I had to come and comment on them. I had 1 pound of huge New Bedford scallops and I cut them in four and followed the recipe to a "T" but added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic. I let them sit in a ziploc for about an hour and grilled them on my foreman for about 5 minutes. AMAZING! They literally melt in your mouth. The only problem is getting them to the Superbowl party before I will make them again and again!

I loved the marinade and the brown sugar sprinkle, the sweetness mixed with the saltiness of the bacon was very nice. I took the advice of other reviewers and only marinated 15 minutes. It was enough, the scallops were delicious.

Tastes better when you just wrap bacon around scallops and bake. Didn't  notice the marinade. Not worth the time.

I'm told that I'm not allowed at my son-in-law's unless bearing a platter of these scallops.  I'm sure he's kidding.  But I'm bringing the scallops just in case.  These are fabulous...last party I made 10 pounds and they vanished.

Excellent recipe! Sweet&Savory meld quite nicely. 
I used fresh, large, dry-packed scallops and marinated for ~ 1.5h. I had no problem with rubbery texture.
I like the rendering step for the bacon. I would like to achieve a crispy bacon wrap around a perfectly cooked scallop. My idea: thinly sliced bacon coupled with an extended rendering.
cheers,

Paul

Rave reviews all three times I've made them. However, I have also made them on the BBQ and not in the oven and without the sprinking of brown sugar at the end.

this was yummy!  i marinated for about 75 minutes and i didnt have any issues with texture. The only thing i did differently was that my brown sugar had been left open and was hard, i put it in a bowl with some water to soften and drizzled it on the scallops, i think it may have made them evenn better, they were almost carmelized. this will definitely be my standard scallops recipe. (oh also super easy for anyone trying to make scallops for the first time!)

The sweet/salty combo is outrageously good. I cooked the bacon for a little longer - about 15 minutes before wrapping in the scallops. I like crispy bacon. Instead of sprinkling with brown sugar I drizzled the marinade over the wrapped scallops before cooking. These are the best. I will definitely make them again.

These were delicious. I recommend rendering the bacon for At Least 12 minutes & plan to let it cool for 10 minutes or so before handling.

The recipe as written makes too much marinade - I cut the maple syrup to a little over 1/4 c. but upped the dijon to 2-2.5 tbsp. I also tried these once with regular pancake syrup and didn't notice much of a difference in the end result. I also like to broil for 1-2 minutes at the end to further crisp the bacon. I will definitely make again - this is a nice different recipe that you can throw together quickly.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I wish there was a way the scallops would absorb the marination a bit more.  Possibly, marinating it overnight would help.  I will definitely make this again!

YUMMY!!!  I have made bacon wrapped scallops several times but never marinated them - I will not make them any more w/out marinating the scallops - WOW!  Unlike others, I did marinate mine for a bit over an hour and they were wonderful, tender, moist and the time stated cooks them perfectly. One change - I will cook the bacon a bit longer just to get a little more done, this is my personal prefrence.  My fiancee couldn't stop eating them, he said they were definitely the best he had had.

Made this for Christmas and they were well received. I'm not a scallop person but my husband is.  I skipped the syrup to decrease calories and it still was good. It's a little messy trying to wrap and cut the bacon, but will make again

How does this recipe only have 100 reviews!? These scallops wrapped in bacon are the best I've ever tried. I always fear that scallops will become chewy, but soaking them really did the trick. Same with cooking the bacon beforehand for several minutes. A couple of woman made "I've never precooked the bacon/soaked the scallops" remarks, but the finished product spoke for itself. Flavorful, moist scallops with crispy bacon - YUM. One reviewer made a comment about how over-marinating the scallops gave it a funny taste and 20 minutes was sufficient, but mine marinated for about 90 minutes and it definitely didn't affect the taste.  Sidenote: for reference, I used Grade B maple syrup (what I had on hand) and the dijon with chardonnay.

I did alter this to fit my needs....but the basic idea was the same. It was fantastic! I marinated jumbo scallops in the maple syrup/soy sauce/mustard mix for about an hour.  I got my charcoal grill good and got, and lined it with non-stick foil.  I then grilled the scallops for about 8 minutes on each side (I like them a bit well done).  So delicious :)

I served these at Easter and they were a huge hit! I rendered the bacon, let it cool a little, and then wrapped the marinated scallops. I baked them at my parents' house. They transported well, cooked beautifully, and tasted amazing. It was an easy, yet decadent appetizer.

Although the recipe was tasty when I was finally finished, it was very expensive to make and I really felt STUPID as I was making it.  How do you handle hot bacon (if precooking according to so many suggestions) to wrap around the scallop? Each of my scallops ended up with AT LEAST two toothpicks and were relatively unattractive! Does this recipe really call for REAL maple syrup?  That stuff is expensive and then after marinating, I just dumped it in the trash?  Did anyone have success with imitation pancake syrup in this recipe?  I don't think I'll make this again.

Wonderful!  I followed the directions exactly (except I didn't cut the scallops in half and I only made 6 for 2 people) and they were absolutely delicious.  This is my 'go to' scallops recipe from now  on!

If you like scallops, you will love these! The sweetness of the syrup balances perfectly with the salty bacon. I have made this a few times now and I find you don't need nearly as much marinade as it calls for. I make half the marinade for the same amount of scallops. I also marinade 2-3 hours instead of just one so they soak up the maple flavour a little more.

VERY GOOD!   I partially cooked the bacon on the stove top, then wrapped the scallops and put them under the broiler, basting several times, resulting in crispy bacon and tender scallops.  Thank you Gabsmom for sharing your recipe!

These were a big hit at my family Christmas dinner. I did like other's suggested and cooked the bacon a little bit.  Great flavor and will make this again.

Very easy and impressive. I do think I would marinate them just a bit longer next time. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Made for New Years Eve 2013 @ P&D's. Partially pre-cooking bacon worked well.

OMG - everyone scoffed these wonderful scallops. I thought all the maple syrup and brown sugar would make it too sweet but it was delicious!

I'm not a big fan of scallops, but after trying this recipe, I've changed my mind. As other reviewers suggested, I halved the marinade, and there was lots.  I marinated for about 2 hours.  I also rendered the bacon for 15 min, as I've done bacon wrapped scallops before and the scallops are usually done before the bacon is cooked.... and you don't want to overcook the scallops or they will be tough...worked out perfect. The bacon was not too crispy/salty and the scallops were soft/sweet and tender. Will definitely be impressing guests with this one.

This is wonderful and easy. I followed the recipe to the letter except I substituted mesquite honey for the brown sugar and broiled them on each side for 2 minutes. Fabulous!

Everyone LOVES these, my husband gets bacon wrapped scallops at every restaurant that has them and he says that these are the best he's ever had! Just make sure to cool the bacon well before wrapping, the first time i didn't let them cook long enough for fear of them burning but they really don't cook much under the broiler... I had to unwrap them all and cook the bacon longer(didn't want to over cook the scallops)

Used bbq sauce vs maple syrup ( didn't have on hand) and they were wonderful. Cooking time was spot on! Something you usually have to fudge with especially on seafood. Look forward to making again.

This are incredibly delicious! Very easy to make. I made ten large scallops and scaled the servings to 4 and it came out perfect. However I only marinated my scallop for 30 mins.

I thought these were just OK, but my guests really liked them.  I used dry wild caught scallops.  I marinated them for about 12 hours.  I used a small piece of bacon on top instead of wrapping them completely.  I omitted the brown sugar on top.  I thought they were a bit too sweet, but everyone else thought they were delicious!

These were great! I only marinated the scallops for about 20 minutes and they had a really nice flavor. I ended up cooking them over a grill outside for about 15 minutes and they were perfect!

Made these for the first time tonight... they are so good! I marinated the scallops for 20 minutes, and I actually think I would prefer them to be a little sweeter so next time I will for 30 minutes. I did not have dijon mustard, but stone ground and it tasted fine. I was concerned about that, but it really tastes yummy! Think of bacon wrapped smokies... similar taste!

Delish flavors from the marinade and the smokiness from the bacon make these delicate scallops absolutely succulent! Everything I've read and experienced with marinating seafood, an hour is far too long. Instead, I allowed my scallops & shrimp to marinate long enough for the oven to preheat and the bacon to bake for the first 8 min... long enough. Although my thick slices of bacon did not crisp up like I prefer, its flavors certainly did wonders for both the scallops and shrimp I used in this recipe. I did not find the sugar to be necessary, as it's plenty sweet and so much flavor already...but add it if you wish, it certainly doesn't hurt! Yum! Good recipe find!

Delicious. Sweet but not too sweet. I did forget the brown sugar but didn't miss it. I think its important to use a good bacon- I love applegates sunday bacon -good amount of smoky flavor and thin so it crisps well. I didn't have any issues with chewiness but  i had really large fresh scallops right off the boat- definitely bigger than store scallops usually are.

Followed recipe exactly except used whole strips of bacon and left scallops whole. Got THICK slices of preservative-free bacon fresh at the deli counter. Husband and in-laws loved it! (served it as part of main course, but really should be an appetizer)  Even asked for me to get more bacon since it was so much better than the stuff in the package. You can control the thickness if they slice it for you. WILL be making this again.

Very tasty! Prepared exactly as directed but only marinated for about 45 minutes which was perfect for us - the scallops didn't lose their texture and retained their distinctive taste. Will definitely make again.

This was good - and I don't like seafood very much.  I think marinating it longer would have made it 5 stars.  I will make it again soon.

Wow, my husband, who would never eat a scallop, said these were great! The only thing I am going to do differently next time is to marinate them overnight. One hour in the marinade didn't do it justice.

Very yummy. We cooked the bacon in a frying pan with extra virgin olive oil, leaving it pliable. Next we wrapped the scallops each in a piece of bacon, didn't need toothpicks. Put in the oven and used a thermometer to make sure the scallops didn't go above 145 degrees. 
We made the sauce separate and didn't use brown sugar. It was very sweet as is - almost too sweet, but I didn't use measure spoons/cups. Also sauteed some mushrooms and almonds as a garnish.

These were really good.  Only had access to tiny frozen scallops.  I stuffed them in some portabello mushrooms since I didn't have toothpicks.  The marinade is delish and I pre-baked the bacon while the scallops were marinating.  I'm going to make these more often!

This is my go to scallop  wrapped in bacon recipe.  To make life a little easier, I use center cut bacon (that way you don't get as much fat and there is no need to cut the strips in half). Also, instead of using a toothpick, the back is the perfect size to wrap around the bacon. Finally, instead of sprinkling them with the brown sugar, I actually coat each one in a bowl so that every part of the scallop and bacon is covered.

This was a very quick and easy recipe for scallops at home. I tend to agree with most people on this recipe....adjust your marinating time Wisely to preserve the seafood taste. I made one change to my recipe. I added old bay seasoning when I added the brown sugar. It was fantastic. Additionally, I would recommend not using thick sliced bacon as it tends to be a bit awkward to eat once wrapped around a scallop. Enjoy this recipe!

Easy, practical and one of the only recipes that mentions how to precook the bacaon so that u dont end up with raw bacon and cooked scallop.  Pefect, don't change a thing when you make it.

These are a tasty appetizer and a step up from the ordinary.  The scallops I used were huge, so if I do this again I might cut them smaller.  I also needed to bake them a bit longer to get the bacon crispy.

This was a big hit! Since several of my family members and I are on a low sugar diet, I skipped the brown sugar and used sugar free maple syrup (Walden Farms) in the marinade. I will definitely make this again!

This was AMAZING! I did a few things different. We used jowl instead of bacon. I didn't have enough maple syrup so I did 1/4c maple syrup and 1/4c honey. I basted the scallops right before I put them in the oven and I broiled for the last 2 minutes to crisp them up. will definitely make again and again.

This was a hit with the entire family. I marinated the scallops and cooked the bacon as the recipe stated. I didn't add the brown sugar because of dietary restrictions, but we honestly did not miss it. Scallops were tender, juicy and flavorful. Thank you for sharing this easy, but very tasty recipe!

Love it! I marinated for about a half hour and they came out delicious. They were a tad salty for my taste... next time will try cutting the soy sauce in half. Still SO delicious, though!!! Thanks for the recipe!

Parboil the bacon in water for 3 minutes instead of baking in the oven first.  Drizzle small ribbons of honey after broiling.

Delicious!
I cooked them on parchment paper for easy cleanup. Also had to cook them a little bit longer because I like the bacon crisp. If you use thick cut bacon, they will take even longer. Also, I boiled down the marinade until it was about a quarter cup and use it for a drizzle.

I've made this several times for various occasions. They are a wonderful appetizer. They always get eaten very quickly. One of my favourites.

Good.  Made as written but did not sprinkle with brown sugar.  Thought it needed salt.  Next time will decrease maple syrup to 1/2 cup and increase soy sauce to 1/2 cup.

I followed the recipe, but forgot to sprinkle the brown sugar before baking.  It was still wonderful.  This is the best recipe I have come across for scallops.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe! I cooked the bacon in the microwave for a few minutes rather than in the oven and cooked the scallops on the grill. Amazing flavor; I will absolutely make these again!

OMG I couldn't stop eating these! So easy to make. I defrosted my scallops, mixed the marinade and microwaved the bacon. While the scallops marinated for an hour, I preheated the oven. I wrapped and cooked the scallops, two to a toothpick since I was just making them for myself, and when they were done, I served them with a cilantro-lime rice and mixed veggies. So delicious!

I thought this was a pretty simple recipe, and was pleased with the result.  The only substitution that I made was using turkey bacon because I had some I needed to use up.  I let it marinate overnight.  I loved it, I think next time I will look for a recipe for a glaze to use when grilling scallops.  I ended up cooking a little longer than the recipe called for.

Awesome and easy.  I used a bag of grocery store frozen large scallops.  Followed recipe exactly.  We loved this treat!  Thank you.  Second time I halved the bacon, as recipe reads, and then sliced the cooked bacon in half ( the long way) again to cut down on bacon.  Perfect.

Make sure to put brown sugar on each.  Otherwise, the maple syrup did not really come out and they were on the bland side.

Two Words - Food Orgasm! Made these for my parents at the beach trying to copy the ones they were served at a Country Club here. These were easy, I made them three to a skewer and served them over garlic spaghetti for dinner! Yum, really yummy!

Wonderful recipe. I used the thick smoked bacon so I had to cook it for a little longer than 8 minutes. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Made it as part of my husband's Italian's side Christmas Eve tradition of The Feast of Seven Fishes. I used a nice thick cut bacon. My non-scallop eating husband even liked them. 
   Easy and Delicious! I think we'll keep this in our Christmas Eve FotSF menu. Thanks!

These were great! I marinated for 1 1/2 hours and that was just the right amount of time. I put on skewers and grilled them. Yummy! Great for an appetizer at a summer barbeque.

These tasted very nice.  I don't think I cooked them long enough, though.

Amazing.  Made it for our anniversary dinner.  Perfect as long as the fat is well rendered from the bacon before wrapped around the scallops.  Scallops cook fast.  Yum.

These are phenomenal, made them for a dinner party and I could barely set the plate down before they disappeared.  Careful buying large scallops as they were almost too big to wrap the bacon around.  Also used extra grainy mustard which looked and tasted great.

So simple and just excellent.  I count calories so I used a low-cal syrup and used Trader Joe's Wasabit Mayo instead of dijon mustard (had no dijon in the house).  Great flavor.  Hubby loved.  Will definitely make again

I made this for my menu of upscale Super Bowl food.  I used large frozen scallops (thawed in cold water over 1.5 hours) and marinated them for only 15 minutes as a previous reviewer recommended to keep the scallop tender.  I also bought thick-sliced applewood smoked bacon and cooked it a bit longer than the 8 minutes to render the fat.  The end result was phenomenal!  The scallops were cooked perfectly, the bacon wasn't chewy or gummy, and they were gone within minutes.  Totally making this for my next family gathering.

Just made these tonight for our New Year's Eve dinner.  They were wonderful!!!  Only thing I did differently was omit the mustard because I didn't have any.  Love, love, love this recipe and will definitely be making them again!!

These were AWESOME!  They got rave reviews from the kids as well as the adults!  I marinated them for about 45 minutes and they were PERFECT!  Thick bacon worked great!  These are definately on our list for holiday appetizers!

These were amazing! We didn't marinade for very long (under an hour) but the flavor was still really good. Four of us ate these and we all feel these are the best scallops we have ever had!!!

I used my cast iron skillet and cooked them under a broiler for about 10 minutes on each side after wrapping them in the nearly-cooked bacon.  They were a hit with my house guests!

I loved these! Made them for Mother's Day and they were a hit. We cooked them on skewers on the grill. Delicious! Don't forget to soak wooden skewers in water prior to grilling (we soaked ours for about 1/2 hour).

This was just ok...  The scallops didnt pick up the flavor of the marinade at all.  It was also a bit dry.

I love this recipe. I didn't have maple syrup so I used honey instead. I also microwaved the bacon instead of baking it. Turned out great!
