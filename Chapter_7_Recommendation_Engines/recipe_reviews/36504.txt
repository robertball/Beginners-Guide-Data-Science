I made this for the second time this weekend and it was even better. Here are my changes/additions: 3/4 cup Old Bay, 2 bottles of beer, 3 quarts water, about 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 lemon cut in half, a bunch of crushed garlic. Next time I will probably use 3 large onions and might use new potatoes. If you want to add more seafood, you can always reduce the potatoes and corn - they take up a lot of room. Wonderful!

What a great and very easy meal to make!  I have made this about ten times so far, and is great, AS-IS. I have found that the frozen corn on the cob (ear nibblers), work very well when fresh corn is out of season. I take them out of the freezer, put them into a colander, and rinse under cool water until they are defrosted.   When I made  this meal this evening, I added 1 more bottle of beer, 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup more water. I then added 1/2 dozen live muscles, 1/2 live baby (small )clams at the same time that I added the corn. When the shells started opening (which took about 6-7 minutes), I added the shrimp and cooked 4 additional minutes. It was wonderful! Please remember to DISCARD any clams or muscles that do not open, as they will make you sick!

My family absolutely loved this one!  I made it on a Friday night on vacation; my 9-year-old twin daughters (who were 'starving!') said it was awesome and worth the wait!!  I only used 1 lb of smoked sausage, 2 lbs shrimp, 6 frozen cobbettes, and 12 sm-med whole red potatoes, but all the spice and beer as written.  When it was over, we had 2 potatoes left.. a definite sign that indeed it is awesome!!  Will make many times more..

Great and easy recipe, would be great for summer entertaining. Although, not quite as spicy as I had hoped. Also, potatoes were a tad over-done and corn was a tad under-done. A few minor adjustments and this recipe would be fabulous!

This is similar to a New England Clam boil which I have fixed for my family for years but, this has a whole lot more flavor! My family loved it! This is fast, easy and full of flavor! It was a hit with everyone, even the kids!  I will make this again!

The only change I made was to squeeze a bit of fresh lemon over each serving.  Every time I make it I wish I had doubled the recipe!

This was the best!!! So easy and so quick, I was able to entertain my guests while easily assembling the meal. Everyone loved it, Next time I'd also try crab legs or maybe chunks of grouper or clams.

This was excellent and the only reason for the 4 instead of 5 star is because I feel the cook time on everything except the shrimp is way too long. 24 minutes on the potatoes just turns them to mush and why would you cook sausage that is already cooked before you add it to the pot for 16 minutes? Cut all of the cooking time down except the 4 minutes on the shrimp and you will have a marvelous feast and a memorable one at that. On a side note, the shrimp and corn take on the spiciness the most and the sausage grabs a hold of the beer flavor the most which results in YUM-O. Thanks Old Bay! I forgot to add that I halved the recipe since just the two of us and I used the whole can of beer.

This was very good...potatoes got very mushy...next time will put them in later.  As recommended by other reviewers, I made the following changes: increased Old Bay Seasoning to 3/4 cup, reduced water to 3 quarts, increased beer to 2 cans.  Added 1 lemon cut in half and 1/2 t. cayenne pepper. Will definitely make again.

Made this many times. Surprising flavor. Beer adds a unique taste (as long as you don't over do it). Reduced potato cook time by 2 min. It's amazing how many family members show up when they find out what's cooking...

WE LOVED IT! We had this in Beaufort, they called it Frogmore stew. However, we did add 1/4 tsp of cayene pepper to heat it up a bit & added the potatoes 3 minutes later after reading other reviews. A must try!!!

This is pretty much the recipe I have been using for years.  I add lemon slices & whole cloves of garlic.  So much fun to "dump" the ingredients onto a plastic table cloth when someone is new to the experience.  I have found it handy to have damp wash cloths in stead of napkins for guests.

My new "tailgate" recipe.  I will probably peel the shrimp next time.  And I might even use frozen corn to make eating easier......but the flavor/mix of ingredients is exceptional.  I used six different types of sausage/kielbasa for variety (made a large batch for 25), and I used an English Porter for the beer. I cut the shrimp amount in half and added an equal amount of bay scallops instead......fantastic!

I almost feel bad reviewing this recipe. I followed it to a t and I was soooo looking forward to eating it. It smelt sooooooo good! I LOVE shrimp. but i was disappointed. I am going to try this again but next time I am not going to leave the skins on the shrimp. My shrimp had NO flavor. I threw it all away. Myself and my husband loved the flavor of everything else. the potatoes were Fantastic. I am going to try this again but with a few changes.

One of THE best boils that I've tried! I was extremely pleased with this recipe.  I cut the recipe in half since it was only for two people.  I didn't add beer and I substituted snow crab legs for the sausage.  I also used a garlic butter dipping sauce.  I sauteed minced garlic in butter over low heat for about 10 minutes.  The dipping sauce really added a nice taste. Will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks!

this recipie was really easy and tasty.  next time i'll add more onions and maybe cook the potatoes less because they ended up being a little too mushy.  but overall this was really unique and yummy.

Great Birthday Dinner Idea!  The first time we had it at a friend's house and it was great!  The second time we made it ourselves. The Next time we will decrease the seasoning since if we do not use the beer, as the potatoes were too spicy without it.  Great Recipe! thanks!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  This was the first time I have ever tried a "boil" and we will definately be serving this again.  It would be a perfect meal to serve for friends and family - there's something for everyone.

Excellent! We also call this Low Country Boil which is served in South Carolina. We make this everytime we go to the beach and there is never a bit left over.

Well I did everything recipe said except adjusting the cook times. I did not find this recipe very flavorful....it was spicy but lack of flavor if that makes any sence. although I have tried to make other dishes with old bay seasoning and felt the same way about those...so maybe I just dont like old bay. Maybe adding chicken stock, or a seafood stock instead of water would make it better.

I halved recipe and used heaping quarter cup old bay and only little over 1 tsp garlic salt.  It was way too much salt.  Kept water the same but full can of beer.  Added a quartered lemon,  Left out onion.  Used defrosted niblets.  I added corn and sausage at same time and cooked 7 min--I think that was too much cook time for those.  Will make again with few modifications

What a hit!  The flavor was incredible and everyone kept saying that we MUST do another shrimp boil sometime.  I did tweak a bit by adding some cayenne pepper to the boil water. (I'm from the south and boiled shrimp should have some KICK!).  I also put the corn and sausage in at the same time since the sausage was already fully cooked.  Otherwise, I just did everything as the recipe instructs and it came out fabulous.

Great recipe! Easy and delicious.  I added 3/4 cup old bay, 3qt water and 2 beers as others suggested...very flavorful! I also took the shells off of the shrimp so that we could devein them.  Sorry, I wont eat shrimp that is not deveined. yuck! We made it outside in a turkey fryer.  But seriously, this serves way more than 8 people!!! Serves more like 14 and we have big eaters! I would make this again and again.

This was really good and fun to make but next time I would put a lot more Old Bay in the mixture... it ended up not having a lot of flavor.

If you really want the beer flavor to come through, use an IPA or any other Ale on hand as opposed to a Pilsner or Lager. Amazing dish, and SO easy. Made this last night and everybody loved it.

This tasted like nothing, really.  I have no idea why the reviews are so good.  All of the food was cooked perfectly, and I did take the advice of adding the potatoes with the corn.  However, it just tasted like I had boiled everything in a pot of water.  It smelled great, but I really didn't get any spice coming through.  I will not make this again.

When I plopped this dish down on the table, my husband gave it a wierd look as though I raided the trash for dinner. He said it looked like "hot garbage". Well, one taste and he was totally hooked. He and our children loved it.  Adding a couple of fresh lemons to the brew livens this dish up.  Great recipe!

I really liked this recipe but did need to use an reviewers suggestion.  I added the potatoes with the corn and they turned out perfectly.  Next time, I will also not cook the shrimp for so long.  I paid $19 a pound for 4-6 shrimp and they were definitely overcooked.  Next time I will put the shrimp in just a couple of minutes before the end of cooking.  Very easy recipe though and I will certainly use it again.

This is a wonderful recipe, so easy and yet so very tasty! I haven't used any beer and really don't miss it.  I served this to four people and we must have been really hungry as there really wasn't that much left over!  Will make again and again.

Very tasty and easy to prepare.. You may want to consider this to serve 10-12 instead of 8. We loved it and had plenty of leftovers.

I've made this several times.  The first time, I was squeamish about all the salt (check the sodium content on the Old Bay label) and cut back on the Old Bay.  It was good, but the next time I used the full amount, and it was better.  It's not too salty-- you don't drink the broth.  Calculate backwards to see when to put the potatoes in.  24 minutes is WAY too long; 12 was right for the potatoes I used.  Also added some scallops just after the shrimp.  A firm white fish would be a nice addition too!

Very good.  After reading the reviews I reduced the cooking time for the potatoes by 2 min. but they still fell apart.  I also added a min for the corn and it was great.  I didn't add the beer but we didn't miss it.  It was still very flavorful.  I am looking forward to making this again.

This dish has great taste and is fun to serve.  I made it on the 4th of July and it was a big hit!  I added king crab legs at the end of the cooking time and served with melted garlic butter.  Yummy.

Yum! This was not only tasty but fun!! Though next time, because of our own flavor likes, I'd add only a little sausage for flavor, and add more seafood-like crab legs! MMMMM

Fantastic!!!!  I halved this for my husband and I and it still made a lot of food.  Since people have said this lacks flavor, I used almost a half cup Old Bay and it had tons of flavor.  I did leave out the beer.  I also peeled the shrimp.  I will definitely be making this again.  Next time I may add some crab.

Oh, wow!!  SUPER DELISH!  Everything was excellent.  I used 3 quarts water, 1/2 C Old Bay, 16 oz Heineken, 2 tbs kosher salt, 4 minced garlic cloves, and a lemon cut in half for the boil.  I halved the rest of the ingredients for a family of 4, and we have LOTS of leftovers.  I can't wait to make this again.  I'd love to make it for entertaining!!  The shrimp was on sale, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to make this.  So GLAD I did!!

Good, but I felt like there was something missing.  I added lemon and garlic and it needed a little something else.  I like it as a base recipe and I'll experiment a little.

This is really delicious!  I added a little more seasoning and cayenne pepper.  Also the cooking time is kind of off.  I put the onions in first and the potatoes and corn together to cook and when the potatoes are ready just add the shrimp, because they cook super fast.

This has sort of become our signature dish!  I use low fat smoked sausage for us- this is sooooooo Weight Watchers friendly and it's MAD good!  We've also done it with andouille sausage too- we use 2 beers when we do it- little red potatoes.  We sort of eyeball it for done-ness using the recipe as the guideline.  Once it's done- we dump it out on the picnic table on newspaper and just grab it and eat it from there!  It's fun, easy and good!!

I made this for my family of six while vacationing at the beach. I made the mistake of using an extra pound of shrimp thinking we wouldn't have enough -way too much.  Also, I followed the advice of the reviewers who suggested reducing the cooking time for the potatoes. They were perfect. I will definitely make this again.

I changed this from a "shrimp" feast to a seafood feast!  I left out the beer, and used andouille sausage instead of smoke sausage, also left out the onions -sorry "onion breath" doesn't sound appealing.  Added in some crawfish, dungeness crab, and snow crab legs...used a "prawn size" shrimp, and red new potatoes, that were a small/medium shape (to allow to cook faster) - this has become a monthly ritual for my husband and I!  Yummy!

We used the four-person serving size but maintained the sane amount of liquid to make sure that it wouldn't dry out.  However, it's fairly safe to say that serves four actually serves six.  We cut three minutes off of the potato cook time and they were still too soft.  Maybe take away another two?  Very tasty.

This is a very good recipe, and similar to one I got from Cooking Light.  The difference though, was that the CL recipe called for a variety of spices including lots of pepper, instead of Old Bay.  That turns out MUCH spicier, and even makes everyone in the house cough when its cooking.  So, this Old Bay version is much easier for the kids to eat, and has a milder taste for those who prefer that.

A HUGE hit at the latest family gathering. We made this several times last summer to rave reviews and it's great in the winter too - just cover the tables! (Hint: don't share the recipe!)

Terrific. I cut everything in half and it came out excellent, spicy good, don't even need butter for the corn, potatoes, shrimp, so it's a great calorie saver.

So, so easy & good!  I thought this would be a fun recipe for company, without a lot of prep or kitchen time.  I did a test run before serving it for guests & reduced the servings to 2.  There was still so much food!  The only thing I would change in the future is to lower the potato cooking time, mine were a little on the soft side.  I don't think I had ever eaten corn on the cob without butter, but cooked this way you don't miss it at all.

Very easy to make, but tastes good only if you like everything to taste the same.  It would have been better to cook each ingredient separately and just cook the shrimp in the Old Bay.

This was not as spicy as I thought it would be, and I could not taste flavor from the beer.  I believe the cooking times were a little off also, because the corn was not done.  I'll be looking for another recipe.

What fun! We used our outdoor turkey fryer pot - we used the Old Bay shrimp/crab boil seasoning - it comes in small box and it's a bag that just gets tossed in the pot - however it did make the onions and potatoes quite spicy. It is a fun summer meal with no mess!

This was good, but not as spicy as I had hoped. I couldn't really taste the Old Bay...I'll probably use less water next time so the spices aren't as diluted. Will try again, though. I love Old Bay!

We enjoyed this and man was it easy!  I used peeled shrimp and frozen corn and everything turned out perfectly.  Definately not underseasoned with the shrimp being pre-peeled, in fact almost a little too spicey for the kids.  Only made a quarter batch with a little extra corn and potatoes and it was plenty for my family of four! Only four stars becuase it was yummy and something I'd make again, but nothing super special.

I agree with some of the other reviewers about the spice; I wish it had more of a kick.  I made half of the recipe and I added 1/3 cup of Old Bay and one whole beer.  I only had lite beer and it did not add enough flavor.  The corn had a really nice flavor to it but my dh and I had to add more Old Bay to get the flavor we desired. I also added 1/2 lb. of flesh scallop at the same time as the shrimp and we thought it was a nice addtion.  We will be making this dish again and again!!

One of our new summer favorites! So simple just follow the times and you can't go wrong! Does make more than the recipe states but it makes great left-overs. I used less water/more beer for the boiling liquid...delicious!

SO good! Should have definately halved the recipe. people are right about the potato cooking time. Mine were mushy. Oh, My 8 qt pot didn't seem to be big enough, i would go at least with less water. The Frozen raw shrimp i got worked good here. easy to peal and already de-veined. My friends were quite impressed. Oh, and i can't cook so this was nice and easy. Thanks Old Bay!

I also halved the recipe and it was still way too much for too people.  Definitely worth the money.  I have made it twice.... I added crab legs this time and they turned out great. just throw some in the pot when you toss in the shrimp.  so good!

Every Wednesday night I cook dinner for the whole extended family and a few weeks ago I made this for them.  Everyone age 3-53 loved it! It makes quite a bit, so be prepared for leftovers.  I did peel and devein the shrimp before adding.  I used large shrimp, but I think I will try jumbo shrimp next time.

Wonderful flavor!  We will surely make this recipe again and again.  I will use a better quality potato next time; maybe yukon gold.  We did use fresh shrimp from a seafood market and with this recipe were the best I have ever eaten!

I followed user suggestions to cook the potatoes for less time - bad idea for me because then my potatoes weren't done when the rest of the food was ready.  I think the cooking times will vary by area.  Also, my shrimp cooked almost instantly when I tossed them in - maybe 1 minute of cook time for them.  I definitely recommend keeping an eye on this while it cooks.  Also, due to the amount of spices involved, the steam for this filled my apartment and made everyone cough (even with the doors and windows open, fans on, etc).  Perhaps make it outside on a boiler or cover when you are cooking.

This is a classic meal for those of us from SC.  If you like spicier food, it is WONDERFUL with spicy smoked sausage!

What a great recipe! I cook this at a few times a month. I have noticed people are adjusting their times with the items and I do the same. You don't need to wait as long although I'm sure it has to do with altitude, etc.

This is really delicious.  For flavor, it gets 6 stars!  However, if prepared exactly as written, the texture of the potatoes earns 2 stars.  I averaged the two and gave it 4 stars.  I WILL make this again and again, as the flavor will keep me coming back...but I will be tinkering with the timing as others have suggested.

I made this last night, and it was the best meal that I have had in a LONG time!  I loved everything about it.  I cut the recipe in half since I was only feeding 3 people, and still had plenty of leftovers, which we love.  I added scallops in the end with the shrimp, and everything cooked evenly!  I will definitely be giving this recipe out.

This recipe is really delicious and so easy to make!  My entire family LOVED it!  My potatoes did fall apart--I will probably add them a bit later next time.  I also added crawfish--yummy!!

Excellent recipe. Everyone went back for seconds. I think next time I might use half smoked sausage and half hot links just to see how it turns out.

This recipe was great!  Very flavorful.  I didn't change anything but I did forget about it at the end and the potatoes got a little extra cooked and were a bit too soft.  My mistake though.  The perfect summertime meal.

This recipe was awesome. I used baby red potatoes but I think next time I would use larger potatoes and halve or quarter so they would season up a little better. Will also add a little additional Old Bay next time around.

Great!  I cut the recipe in half and it was perfect for 4 hungry adults.  Gotta love how simple it is.  Definately take the advice of putting the potatoes in with the corn so they don't cook too long.  All the other cook times are spot on!

The flavor of this was really good.  I added two fish fillets (cubed), left out the can of beer, and cooked the corn a bit longer and the potatoes a bit less than suggested.  The potatoes were still overdone......either use larger pieces or whole small potatoes.  Half the recipe was still A LOT of food.

This was so easy to make and tasted great. Since I have a baby I did all my prepping in the morning while the little guy was taking a nap. When it came time to cook everthing it was really easy to put together. I used colossal shrimp and also bought a loaf of sour dough bread. I even toasted the bread in the toaster to make it easier on myself. Delicous!

Absolutely amazing! So easy and so so good! Everyone in my family loved this meal. Cover your table with newspaper, and just dump the contents of your pot into the middle of the table! No plates or silverware needed, the kids will have a great time with this recipe!

My family wasn't crazy about the corn and would probably cook that separately in the future. Otherwise, I loved the fact this came together so quickly. Would be a great dish for casual entertaining as prep can all be done before guests arrive.

What is more fantastic. Im a seafood lover and spicy food lover this is sooo good. My husbands family during the summer has what we call seafood boils and use the exact same ingredients that are used in this recipe. It so delicious that there are never left overs. Defenitely a keeper.

Wonderful.  I think it should be a 16 quart pot.  I added king crab legs to the top for a few minutes and when I dumped the pot the juice was enough to warm them up.  I love that it's all in one pot and all food groups (meat, starch and vegetables).  All my guests have asked for the recipe. Uum Uum Good !
