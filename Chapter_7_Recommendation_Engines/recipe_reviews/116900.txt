The recipe calls for the cookies to be pressed down prior to cooking... I did that with half and left the rest as balls.  My husband preferred the 'unpressed' ones, as he thought they were gooier/chewier.  Made a double batch the next day.  Experimented with taking the rolled dough balls, rolling in granulated sugar, then baking.  It's all good!  I did notice for the double batch, when I was done baking, there was a Tablespoon of Canola oil remaining in the bottom of the bowl.  So, when doubling, next time, rather than 1/2 c. oil, will try  3oz.  - Made again (4th time w/ this recipe), this time as BAR COOKIES!  EXCELLENT! I had a 17" x 10" rimmed baking sheet to fill.  Doubled the recipe, but only used 1/3 c. oil. Used milk chocolate chips.  Baked at 350 for 25 minutes. Removed from oven, then immediately sprinkled an extra cup and a half of chips on top, let set a few minutes, then spread as frosting.

The recipe is pretty straightforward.  I love the combo of chocolate/peanut butter.  They came out exactly as they were supposed to.

One change I did make was to add a peanut butter M&M in the center of the cookie (wrapping the dough around it).  So when you bite into the cookie, you get an extra treat!

very good recipe! I used all natural peanut butter and it worked just as well, and I added ground flax seed for extra fibre. I also substituted half the flour for whole wheat flour and they turned out great.

Easy and tasty cookie.  I followed the recipe exactly and baked the cookies for 9 minutes and they turned out delicious.  I didn't really like using canola oil, so next time I might substitute a combination of Crisco and butter.  Will also add peanut butter chips next time to give more peanut butter flavor.

I was worried about the oily batter at the end, but they indeed turning out wonderful.I used m-n-ms instead of choc chips and I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the floor, and rolled them in a sugar cinnamon mixture before baking and these are the best cookies I've made in a while.

These cookies are fantastic. I followed the recipe almost exactly, only I used regular creamy peanut butter instead of chunky (just as a preference). I was a little nervous before baking them because the dough was so oily and gooey, but after eight minutes they were perfectly baked delicious cookies!

I couldn't believe how big a hit these cookies are. They are tastey, chewy and very often requested. This is now my go too cookie for all occasions.

This was very easy to put together and baked up nicely in the convection oven. Have to agree with other similar comments on the taste - somehow the peanut butter and the cocoa blended together with no real distinct flavor of either one coming through. I rolled some of the balls of dough in a cinnamon sugar blend like you do for snickerdoodles and I did find this gave a more complete taste to the cookie. Mine came out soft but crisped nicely as they cooled. I think this is a good base recipe that could be tweaked with the baker's personal touches. I will be trying these again.

Followed this exactly and loved it! We made the cookies bigger than the recipe called for ( who doesn't?) and they were so decadent and chewy! YUM!! We liked that they were lower in fat too, that way we can eat more:)

These cookies are super easy to make and fool proof.  I used wheat flour, reduced the white sugar, just slightly and mixed 1/2 cup almond butter and 1/2 cup natural chunky peanut butter. I didn't flatten my cookies. I have made these twice.  Once without chocolate chips and once with, they were both yummy.

I replaced the canola oil with half butter and half shortening.  I did not flatten and baked for 10 minutes.  I also did not have chocolate chips so I did not add any.  These are very good!

These are amazing! I added a little extra peanut butter to the mix (about two tablespoons or so) and they came out perfect. The chocolate and the peanut butter flavors came together perfectly--like a Reese's peanut butter cup. They are super most and practically melt in your mouth when they come out of the oven. I baked them to give to friends for Purim, but I couldn't keep from eating more than a few myself. I'll definitely be making these again, and I'll experiment with peanut butter chips or white chocolate chips. Yum!

For a relatively healthy cookie, this recipe gets 5/5. Compared to all cookies, though, it's 4/5. I replaced half the flour with whole wheat and they were still delish. Not terribly sweet, but still enough to be a yummy treat.

Oh my goodness, I loved the dough.  I think I actually preferred it over the cookie itself.  The cookie was pretty good..it would have probably been great if i used regular pb instead of all natural stuff.  I made two batches...well half a batch with peanut butter and another with almond butter.  I think I liked the almond butter better since I added coconut to that batch. Yum.

These cookies were great! I think they would be just as good without the mini chocolate chips, so I might try them without them next time. Since I only ever buy creamy peanut butter, I added some peanut butter chips as well. Worked well.

We love them. Weird dough makes a super yummy, addictive cookie! Not overly sweet and bake up wonderfully chewy. We used natural creamy peanut butter as that is all we had in the house. We will make these again!

I was worried while I was making these because the dough was very oily, but they turned out really good.  The reason it isnt quite 5 stars for me, is I like a really sweet cookie, and this isn't really sweet. The texture is wonderful. I will make these again!

Really easy, really yummy!  We followed the recipe, but with creamy peanutbutter and used 1/2 cup white flour, 1/2 cup white/whole wheat flour.  Turned out great.  We pressed some of them, and left some of them balls before cooking.  All of them were delish!

These are really good.  Only change I made was use smooth peanut butter because that is all I had.  They are best right out of the oven or shortly after.

This recipe is dynamite. I took these in to work and everyone raved over them and asked for the recipe. The only problem I had with it was that I only had about 2/3 c. of regular chunky peanut butter and had to use reduced fat for the rest. I think it made the cookies a little dry, so I had to add a little extra oil.

These are the greatest chocolate peanut butter cookies I have ever eaten.  Since making these the first time, I double the recipe and freeze what I don't serve.  My husband doesn't like nuts so I use regular peanut butter.  I also bake the cookies for 8 minutes, just until the cookies 'crack, that way they are soft.  We are really hooked.

This recipe is not only delicious, it is also apparently idiot proof!  I intended to follow the recipe as written except to sub Splenda for the white sugar.  Turns out, I didn't have regular peanut butter, so I used reduced fat and threw in about 1/4 cup PB chips.  Didn't have quite enough cocoa, so I used a little extra chocolate chips.  On top of the improvised ingredients, the whole batch had been inthe oven for 10 minutes before I realized I forgot to put in the eggs!!  Took them out, let them cool, threw them all back into the mixing bowl and added the eggs and re-baked them.  They should have been a disaster, but they are the most amazing twice-baked cookies ever!  Next  time I'll double check to see that I have the proper ingredients before I start and see if the actual recipe compares to the screwed up batch I will never be able to duplicate!

This recipe was good, but a little bland. Like others said, not very sweet. Next time I will probably use more sugar and possibly a little more peanut butter. I used creamy peanut butter since I didnt have chunky, and thought it came out well.

I used creamy peanut butter, omitted the oil, and used whole wheat flour. Letting the dough rest for five minutes before dropping on cookie sheet and baking helped form the cookie better. Instead of pressing with a glass, I swirled them somewhat flat with my finger. Very good and healthier than most cookies.

Good flavor, although not as sweet as most cookies.  They don't spead much but the texture was nice and moist (I did use a little extra egg, since I made 1/4 recipe to test it, but still used 1 med egg.) I also substituted Splenda for the white sugar.

The cookies were quite easy to make, and had a good taste. I would recommend baking them a little longer than 10 minutes, maybe about 12 or 15 minutes because they tend to come out very chewy. They also need a while to cool off, I put mine in the fridge. I found that the batter was sweet so I included only a half cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.

These were so delicious!! I used creamy peanut butter and did not add any chocolate chips, and they turned out so moist and yummy! I also used vegetable oil instead of canola. Def one of my favorite cookies yet! I followed someone else's advice and rolled the dough into balls and left them that way in the oven. I made them a bit bigger and the recipe made about a dozen large, thick moist cookies. I did cook them a couple minutes longer because of the thickness. Amazing turn out. A keeper!

A month or so ago I made a double batch & froze half the dough.  I thawed it yesterday and baked the cookies - they were fantastic even after being frozen.  I do recommend making them on the bigger size, because they then get a chewy consistency like brownies.

I omitted the chococate chips, and these cookies still came out great! They were super gooey and moist, and stayed that way for a few days in an airtight container. I may have made them too big, because they were a bit too soft, and fell apart when picked up. I think they could work much better as a bar cookie/brownie type dessert, and that is how I will make them next time.

These are very yummy.  I substituted regular flour for Bob's Redmill Gluten-free flour and added a half teaspoon on Xantham gum.  They were perfect!
